    "My friends left me, whats wrong with me and how do I fix it? So Im a teenager right now about to start my junior year of high school. I just want some help honestly, because no matter what I do, no one likes me. Im not sure why. I like to think that Im kind and nice or something, but it seems that a lot of people dont think that, or theyll say it and then take it back later somehow. Ive been told Im funny, and then later that I should stop making jokes because its not my thing. Its like Im interesting at first, Im funny, Im nice, Im as what my ex best friend described me as The best friend I always wished for. But then a few months later she said that I was toxic and that I was lucky she was going to give me another chance because I could be a good friend when I wanted to be. Then a month after that, she apparently had to delete her discord, but from mutual friends I heard that she was still on there daily. Just recently shes messaged me asking to make contact again. I pretended to not see it, because honestly I really thought she was my best friend. I made animatic type videos of us together, so I basically drew us together hundreds of times. We did everything together as well. But I just cant understand what happend, why she just had the sudden change of mind that I wasnt a good friend anymore. Its not like we were in a fight or anything, it was just that I started talking too her less than we usually did Our normal was like 3 hours a day because of covid, and then during this time it was more like 1 hour I kept up my same upbeat and funny persona that I try to play, but she just... she left me. My other friend was a guy who hung out with us. After about a month of covid, he ghosted us and would only ever make contact by texting andor commenting on things we made saying cringe or oh god... and then not responding after that. After about 6 months I got fed up with this so I wrote him a essay on how ghosting and making only rude comments isnt nice and that I was sort of hurt that he was doing this.",
    "27 yo Male, living with parents, having some family small businesses but personally having insignificant involvment. Dating an older women from other town. What should I do ? Hello everyone, I think about myself as an old child, unable to launch. Even though I started my own company, and began developing wordpress based websites, I havent earned much my whole life. I feel like a total st. For about a month Ive met a girl in a nearby city, who is 5 years older than me. She has a stable job with a much better income than mine, but she pays for rent and says that she cant save any money. Both of us are the only children our parents have. She wants a child soon, so she is looking for commitment, but on the other way, she says that she is not willing to limit any of my freedom. I was through a couple of bad relationships and I am not into hooking up randomly and not even dating anymore. I am very very frustrated and I dont know what should I do. Should I leave my parents, even if they need my help from time to time, take the nothing that I have and move with her? I am not confident, my schedule is a mess, I have a big problem waking up in the morning and I have no idea what to do. I sometimes wonder if I am semiretarded, or having some autistic spectrum disorder. I had problems with weed and alcohol and I incline towards addiction most of the time. I am stressed out nowadays because I have work which needs to be done, very limited time and little to no money. PLEASE HELP!! !",
    "Still hurting from betrayal I posted awhile back but I am still having trouble and I would appreciate the support. My 26M ex gf 26F cheated on me and left me for some guy she had only known for 3 weeks. I loved her so much. We had been together for almost 7 years. We had plans to get married and buy a home together. To travel together have kids and start a family together She abandoned me and the dog we raised together for some low life with no career or education that pursued her knowing we were in a committed relationship. It hurts. There are so many memories of the good times we spent together. I was so close with her family. She had always said she couldnt imagine her life without me. Now shes off with this horrible person acting like theyre soulmates. I know I deserve better than someone who would cheat on me and lie about it. I am just still having trouble believing she actually did this to me and that shes gone and never coming back. I was such a good boyfriend. I made her breakfast in bed and surprised her with dinner when she had a late shift. I would plan special surprises for the holidays and birthdays. Yet she still cheated on me and left me. I go from sad to angry to depressed to sad again. I dont really know what to do. Thanks for taking the time to read and comment. I know there are a lot of people out there going through hard times.",
    "Every night just before drifting off to sleep, I'm overwhelmed with feelings of self hate and guilt. It spikes in me just before drifting off to sleep, like I was watching my life in a movie but then I suddenly realize its real and I am overcome with fear, dread, embarrassment, and guilt, like Im driving a train off a bridge or something. Could it be a brain tumor pressing against some part that controls these negative flight reactions? Why am I feeling these things flood into my brain right before drifting to sleep?",
    "I feel like I have no reason to be alive after I saw a movie I was looking forward to. Ok I know it sounds dumb but I only get through life because I have things to look forward to, usually Im looking forward to movies or TV shows. Today I saw a movie that I was really looking forward to for a while, I loved the movie but afterwards I felt like I had nothing else to push me through life. I try to look forward to other stuff but I dont really feel that excited for the stuff coming out.",
    "Stuck in a hole of lack of motivation/productivity How do you motivate yourself to get tasks for workpersonal lifeselfcare done daily? I usually feel pretty productive and motivated 1 day out of the week and spend the other 6 days at a loss for energy to get anything done and end up hating myself for being lazy and then stressing out over all the things I could haveneed to do and then feel bad for even stressing out over all of it because why didnt I just do it? I dont deserve to feel bad for myself when its as easy as just doing it. Been stuck in that cycle for a couple months now. Anyone else been through this? And if so how did you climb out of the hole of the endless cycle this is beginning to feel like.",
    "Still on the fence For a long while now I have been depressed and havent really had many close friend and for a little bit hitting a point of literally just 1 semi close online friend and no body else at all, but thats besides the point. For the last probably month or 2 I have been on the fence or just cant decide on what to do with one side being just live a happy life with a tightly knit group of girl and maybe online friends with possibly even a relationship and the other side being suicide. For the longest time Ive been leaning back and forth and thanks to friends Im feeling better some time but thanks to school and alot of punishments and groundings every so often and fairly recently having moved between states pushing me the other way. Im not sure if this is just me or amazingly common but I just dont know what to do any more and I want to be able to land on the right side of the fence on my feet and not fall back into a pit sorry if its an odd analogy. I just really dont know what to do since the only people who ever really reach out to me are semi close friends and just some school mates ending nonsense. All I do if sit around mostly unmotivated to make a difference and better things for myself by simple even doing homework but instead I feel like a lazy bum who uses his only bit of motivation to ask a handful of friends how their day was when I see them only but still feel like Im just pestering them. I mean its been almost half the school year now and the only person who sits next to me because they want to and not because their entire group moved to where I sit is my semi close friend I mention earlier. Ive got nearly no friends, got near nonexistant privacy, no motivation, and the only 2 things that I can always look back on for a reason to keep going are Im my dad only child and he put 15 years of effort into making my last this long and just the simple question of how can I do it quick without it hurting too much or looking a fool.",
    "I feel like a waste and I don't know what to do. Where do I begin? I guess to start, I recently got engaged to the love of my life back in June youll see why this is important in a second. I am also in a very demanding work industry, in education. Special Education to be more specific. I love working with kids and it can be very rewarding, however, its the most taxing job. My fiancé is a very supportive person while also keeping me realistic. My dream is to stream and I used to and it was fairly successful, to my surprise, when I started. I gained a lot of followers, viewers, and even a few donations even though thats not why I started to do it. My stream was focused on just having fun doing hobby and trying to shine light on mental health. My 1 passion in life is to help others. And I have tried to find careers that revolve around that, but to much dismay. So my stream was to offer advice when asked, listen, and just talk. Talking helps. Even talking about random things. Anyways, she supported me while I did this during the summer. I knew it bugged her that she had to go to work every day and I got to stay home and fulfill a passion of mine. I am drowning at work and it has completely taken over my life. I find no joy in my old hobbies. Watching sports, playing video games, hanging with friends, etc. This past week my fiancé told me that I remind her of a hermit. I hate going out, hanging with friends, all that. I hate having fun is what she told me. Frankly, I realized this before she had told me. Furthermore, I am faced with the decision of resigning from my job and chasing my dream. The repercussions of this is that there wont be stable income coming from me, my fiancé doesnt make enough right now to support us both and we talked about it. We were looking to buy a house in the next year, as well. I feel like Im a waste though. Do I just nut up and suffer just to achieve the goal of getting a house?",
    "My ex husband dead because of me and I hate living I married my ex husband when I was 18. We had 2 kids together. I already had 2. There was ups and downs. Good times and bad ones but something that stayed constant was he wouldnt work. I went to nursing school with the promise he would take care of the home. This didnt happen. After 7 years of this and also quite a bit of mental abuse I divorced him. The kids started getting into trouble and were so upset. Plus to be honest I missed him. I went back. I did this for 8 more years. Meanwhile he had developed quite the tab habit. And me overdrawn everyday day trying to feed habits and kids. I didnt leave again til it got so bad he was needing stronger and stronger things and me and the 2 girls left at home had no running water or lights. It was hard without family. He begged and begged me to come back. Just like last time. He also played bad guy and even tried to get me fired. He died less then a year after we left. He was in a crack house. High on heroin and fentanol. His kids devastated. So now here am i.. with all the things ppl know I went through. And I have to be strong for the kids. But there was some good times too. Some only him and I shared. He understood me like no one else. He wasnt always a drug addict. Maybe I actually hoped subconsciously that he would get better and we could try again. After all I had never cared about anyone like I do him. All I know is I miss him so fucking much! I cry every day. I dont wanna live without him. Everything and I mean everything makes me think of him.. and Im so lost. I cant believe he left me. He left me here without him and it hurts so damn bad and I dont know how to make it stop. I just want him.... and all this im feeling roaring in me like a fire.",

    "I have no motivation This is hard. I am not doing very well. My life has been falling apart for a while now, I dont know how Im even functioning right now. I dont even have the energy to switch to my anonymous account for this anymore. It started after I lost my job. Then I lost my wife. Im working a menial overnight job now, and I just cant bring myself to start today. I feel like I lost myself. I feel like Im unworthy of love or compassion or kindness. I feel miserable every second. I tell myself that I am okay, because u know Im not and if I keep telling myself Im okay then maybe I will believe it. I miss my wife. I miss her for all the obvious reasons you miss a spouse. I try and put myself out there because I think Im ready, but Im not over her and I dont know when I will be over her. She was my first. I miss her. I went to therapy for a little while. She gave me some advice that didnt work and I stopped going. It never helped anyway, I would leave feeling 100 times worse. We have a kid, she is 3. The nature of the new job allows me to watch her while my wife goes to work. I try and sleep a little and I wake up to make sure she is ok then I go back to sleep. I couldnt sleep today. I couldnt do much of anything. I did all the things Im supposed to do as her father, but that was it. Normally I play and interact with her, but I just laid there without sleeping staring at nothing. I feel like such a failure. Everything is falling apart and I have no one to talk to and nothing I can do. I tried winning her back several times. I bore my soul. She doesnt want me or doesnt love me or both, and it tears me up inside. All I ever did was love her. I was just going through a real bad fit of depression, for longer than I think I was. I just feel so lost.",
    "Deleting everything Ive thought about it a lot these past few months. I want to completely wipe all of my electronics and just get rid of them. Theres nothing bad on them or anything, I just dont want to deal with it anymore. The only thing stopping me from doing so is my online friend. Weve been friends for about 3 years and hes the most supportive person Ive ever had in my life. If I get rid of everything, I wont be able to talk to him anymore. Part of me doesnt want to stay in touch with him though. It may sound weird but I feel like if I lose touch with someone important in my life such as him, Id have an excuse to cut ties with everyone else. I know it doesnt make much sense. Its not only that though. I want to get rid of a majority of the things I own and I want to stop talking to people altogether. I wish I could just run away but I dont know what Im trying to run away from. I wish I could start life over again, but we all know that cant happen. My original plan was just to move far away when I turn 18, leave everything behind, and never look back. I dont know what I want to do or even what I should do.",
    "Just found out the girl I’ve speaking to the last 7 years is talking to someone else. Need some advice please. Hi, Throw away account just cause I dont feel real comfortable posting this on my main account. Also excuse the formatting If its not correct, and the length. Im a 26 year old male whos had a thing for their best friend I know right for the last 7 years known her for 14 years and I only just found out tonight that the reason shes been ignoring me for the last week is because shes speaking to another male. Shes known Ive had the feelings for her for the last 7 years and she always tells me she doesnt feel the same way. Weve had so many arguments over some real stupid shit like her blocking me on social media when she goes out so I dont see any photos of her with guys because she knows I get real upset about it. Every time we have the conversation of my feelings I always ask her to be honest with me and tell me if shes talking to someone, because itll hurt me less coming from her rather than me finding out the hard way, and she always tells me no. The last time we had this conversation was 2 weeks ago. Fast forward to tonight, I had a mutual friend come over who I havent seen in around 2 years who asked me if I still have feelings for her. Me not wanting to show my emotions said I dont, so she then followed by saying oh my god can you believe shes talking to name. I was like wtf are you talking about? She then began to tell me how she has been talking to our mutual friends friend for the last 23 months. She then began to show me all these photos and messages that the mutual has shown her, so I got to see everything with my own eyes. I always had a feeling she was hiding something from me but I always got the answer no from her so I always ignored. Shes my best friend, shes literally the reason Im still alive. Ive been through hell and back with her, and I value her friendship so much that I can get through all the suffering and pain I have when shes around just so I can spend some time with her, but all she does when she comes over is sit on her phone for hours and just smiles at it.",
    "What do I say to people who ask what's wrong? Im in a funk. No real reason why. Nothing has set me in a downward spiral. In fact, I should be super happy since we just bought a new house that I love. I AM happy about it. I love my house. But here I am again having no energy for personal relationships, fighting the urge to end all of my friendships because I just dont want them. Its not urges to just end the friendships, but destroy friendships, burn all bridges. My work was being affected and I took a day off on Tuesday just because I didnt want to be there. I have never taken a day off for no reason. I am sure this will pass and Ill be fine again. But what do I do in the meantime? What do I say when people ask if everything is ok? Or when they say something is up with me? There is literally nothing for me to be upset about right now. I am afraid I am going to come off whiny or just self pitying.",
    "Not sure what to do Im so depressed. I have nothing to live for anymore. All my friends hate me, they constally argue with me. I dont feel like I can even talk to anyone in my family. My life is the same everyday, I hate it. I have no hobbies anymore because nothing is fun. I cant handle life anymore. Being trans ftm really isnt helping since I constantly get misgendered even when I tell people about it. Im so selfish and have no empathy for others. I hate myself and others. Id be better off gone.",
    "Looked in the mirror I have run into 2 major problems in my life atm, it has been eating away at me for the better part of a month. Ill give you some backstory I have people pleaser all my life. I feel like I have always gone with the flow, with peoples expectations of me rather than have my own. I have done that since I was a kid and Im now turning 20 this year, And with that being said the first problem I have run into is, I dont know what I want and like partly due to the depression. But mostly due to the fact that Ive never really done or said what I wanted to to outside forces shutting me down at every turn school, parents etc.. Idk and its driving me up a wall. 2 I thought hard about the people pleaser trait in my being a lot and I have come to this conclusion, I hate who I am. I believe that I am selfish and feel because I havent done what I have wanted in my life I am inauthentic. So I go and look for outside validation and love because I feel like I am incapable of it. But when I receive it, and it doesnt hit the way I wanted it to or things are too fast or far. Like a addict I dump them and look for a new person to give me that feeling I long for. Its fucked up, because the other people care about me and I do to to an extent, but I prioritize my own feelings and shit first. And that realization fucked me up so bad. Real bad. Any thoughts would be great because Im so lost rn. Thanks",
    "I'm extremely suicidal, but don't have the balls to commit :/ Umm Im not good with this kind of stuff, so sorry in advance. Ive been struggling with anxiety and depression for years now and its gotten to the point where Im having suicidal thoughts and breaking down everyday. I feel really lonely. Thats the best way to put it, I feel that I annoy people so much that they just choose to ignore me. Different topic, but similar premise I think Im scared of my mom, I can tell she doesnt like me that much and shes said to my face that she has a favorite child Im not it Im afraid shes gonna hit me or get so fed up that she disowns me. Im pretty sure most of this is anxiety and paranoia, but shes hit me once before and she drinks fairly often Thanks for listening to me b Sorry for taking up your time",
    "Haven't been working for 2 months, I've been bed bound--stsrting my first shift now Hi all, Ive recently started working again after being out of it for 2 months. I was mainly bed bound, sleeping most of the day away, spent most of my time smoking. I wasnt still kinda not? eating properly, barely doing dishes, laundry, and it was such an effort to shower and brush my teeth. I have to be able to pay bills though  So I ask now, how to I push through and maintain this job? I already have extreme anxiety about starting a new job, it makes me feel physically sick and I start to uncontrollably bite my fingernails. Whats left of them anyway. Any support, kind words of encouragement, or advice starting a job when youre transitioning from bed bound depression.",
    "What helps you get through the day? Its been four months since I turned eighteen and everything seems to be a mess for me. My depression is severe and its getting the best out of me, my anxiety is consuming me and it hurts me badly. My ptsd long story really gets me to have these attacks where Im not myself and I just experience more pain. Ive tried counseling for years, Ive had depression ever since I was eleven and my mother passed away the day after mothers day. Ive talked to my boyfriend a lot about my issues and my feelings and I really dont want him to have to carry more and have more on his plate. I really love him.. I want to be able to support myself and try to find something that can help me get through the day. So, my question is, what helps you get through the day? What thoughts do you think that help you get through it all? Coping strategies? I play a lot of video games but sometimes its just not enough for me Is there any way to express your feelings more appropriately and not have everything just overwhelm you and you explode? I know not everyone is the same, and that many answers will vary, but Im trying to get out of my old habits and I just need some help and support. I want to better myself, and I dont exactly know how to.",
    "Everything is going downhill again. I felt that for a couple months things were going well and I was finally on track to getting my life together. this pandemic has kind of uprooted everything and I feel super isolated and demotivated again. I cant get myself out of bed most days let alone study for my degree im a med student, exercise or eat. The main thing is I just think about how much of a failure I am, how everyone hates me and how worthless I am. Anyone got experience with getting themselves out of a rut like thiscurrently feeling the same?",
    "I'm tired and feel so drained. I know things will get better, but this part really sucks. I recently ended a toxic friendship and it hurts. Im a 44 year old single mom to a very sweet and loving 10 year old boy. Ive suffered from depression since my teens so I know the deal and all the little self care things I can do to help. Im just low on spoons right now. Im on medication but have missed 2 doses due to napping and being off schedule. Ill get back on track today though. This is most likely why Im in a slump today and things feels worse right now. I was in a bad depressive episode for about 45 months in 2020, like many others Im sure. I felt it was finally lifting, but it seems I was wrong. The stress of home learning, being stuck at home, having no social circle or bubble at all has really hit me hard. I dont have many friends, to be honest just one very good friend for the last 20 years or so, but due to COVID19 I havent seen her in about a year. We talk on the phone but its not the same. For the last 10 years I considered another single mom my friend, even though we rarely saw each other and were not close. The friendship was toxic for me and we had many talks about what wasnt working, what was and what I needed from the friendship, with no improvements and I was always sad with this friendship. I ended it last night after talking about things again for the last week or so. I know its the right thing to do for myself, but its so hard. I guess what Im hoping for from this post is support and any advice on how to get over a friendship. With the two spoons I have left today Im going to shower and put on clean pjs and get my son ready for his appointment.",

I dont have any courage, any willpower, any energy whatsoever. I feel lost and dont know how I can stop being like this. Theres so much other stuff wrong with me I havent said here. Ive also thought about suicide quite a bit. Doubt Id actually follow through with it, but the thoughts are there.",
    "Having no money is a huge source of depression and I hate it when people try to convince me otherwise Its not about not being able to afford stuff for yourself, its about not feeling safe, not knowing if youll afford to live and always having weight on your shoulders. Im 18 and my mom kicked me out of the house half a year ago on my birthday. Ive always worked for my own money but since covid situation here in Europe is really bad I cant find a job with not even finished highschool Im a straight A student but that wont matter since Ill probably have to focus on work not university. Im barely scraping with help of friends but they are struggling too at the moment so Im kinda alone. Im on a 10 weekly budget for food and Im really at my edge.

    "Feeling at the end of the line A couple years later I met my first long relationship girlfriend and as you can imagine I fell hard for her and spoiled her like crazy, she helped my reconnect with my father and I told her about my trauma and to my surprise she also was a victim, we both tried to get professional help within our means but only I got serious about it and kept going to my sessions, she said she was fine on her own and knowing how hard this was I let her take her own choice and just tried to be supportive when needed, needless to say it ended bad, near the end when we were about to move in together I tried to start a conversation about how we began getting together and how special she was to me, apparently I was the only one that felt that way because she told me that the only reason she kissed me and begun hanging out with me was because she felt pity for me, we had other issues like a poor sexual life and not enough time on her part for us, so after she told me about how we really had begun our relationship I felt numbed and after a few days in emotional hell I broke up with her, I listed all that was wrong with the relationship and told her that something that begins with pity cant have a future, I wasnt able to tell her that that was what hurt me the must, she never apologized and we went our separate ways, her family loved me and knew I was the good guy and I was the best for her and tried to help but never went passed of a small conversation with me, they were harder on her but in the end they are her family, I found out she also cheated later on and it was what killed the last pieces of love I had for her, I didnt confront her about it and we never spoke ever again, the pity confession destroyed my self confidence we were together for close to 4 years.

    "i can’t stop hurting myself ive struggled with depression my entire life ive tried therapy and everything and i thought why not give travelling a go to try and help it or at least take my mind away from bad thoughts. the first two weeks were great as i was constantly occupied but here i am now currently in Nepal ive been in my hostel almost everyday depressed and on the verge of crying for no reason. i picked up a cheap combat type knife from a trekking shop the other day and since then i havent been able to stop cutting myself to relieve the stress as i have no other form of medication or therapy here, i am extremely unsociable and i cant talk to people its just a personal trait so i cant attempt to make new friends as it makes my anxiety go through the roof. my flight home isnt for another 2 weeks and im just watching the days go by. I even spent an extra 260 just to book my plane ticket earlier than before it was previously on the 23rd of april now its the 10th im just dreading these next 2 weeks i just dont know what to do with myself i keep breaking down, im a mess of a person",

I like to help give advice but I never ask for any because I dont want to be a nuisance but I have goals that I want to accomplish that I just have lost so much motivation for... I even fell behind in school for two semesters. I started college while I was 15last year, but Im still in highschool duel enrollment.

Theyve helped alright, but Ive heard that if you just stop them you can get sick. Thats what the nurse at my therapymedication office said to my therapist anyway.

    "My Heart Feels Like It's Emotionally Bleeding I dont want to constantly worry. Im diagnosed with general and social anxiety with depressive episodes because of the aforementioned and it never ends. I have a wobbly relationship with alcohol, because it allows me some reprieve from the constant weight of worrying, but I have a tendancy to not be able to stop and get irritable, which is absolutely one of my biggest reasons to feel ashamed. Im cutting down, I dont consider myself an alcoholic but I feel its lack of presence. Ive been known to even go so low as to abuse a strong painkiller I was given from hospital for something unrelated. I feel lost a lot of the time and its come to a point where Id rather talk anonymously to people on the internet than my partner or friends because, for once, I want to be the reliable one, the happy one. The one everyone enjoys... People love my energy when I have my good moments, and honestly... I do too! I want more of it! But fighting your own mind on a constant basis, introverted...

    "my LDR boyfriend admitted he has depression and wants a break because of it he keeps saying things like this, which is hard for me to accept because I know what its like to be depressed. he is pushing me away and hiding this part of himself from me, and I just want nothing more than to support him and be there for him which made me feel like my visit was even more urgent. he kept saying things like how he would feel sorry for me if i tried to stay by his side and support him, and how he doesnt want to burden me with his problems or ruin my bdaychristmasnew years by making me sad. he even said, verbatim The more you care about me, the more I feel bad for you, regardless of what youre saying.

Im just really desperate to talk to someone about this, and I really do need advicesupport. How can I support him, aside from giving him space?

So last night me and one of my buddies, who I am very close to, had a discussion on whats been going on in my head. Lately I have been feeling super sad and borderline suicidal because I have been focusing on my childhood and have come to the realization that I had an abusive childhood. My abuse was mostly psychological and verbal, but it still hurt and I can still feel it to this day. Anyways, last night me and my buddy were discussing how my childhood was abusive and how I try to reach out to others particularly women for comfort, because I feel that I was denied affection by my mother while growing up. All through the conversation, it didnt feel like I was connecting with my friend, only my internal emotions and sorrow. It felt like the mini therapy session we were having was doing little. After leaving I felt hollow on the inside. It lasted till about noon this morning. Felt completely worthless and useless. I was wondering if anyone had tips for what to do when feeling hollow and how to better connect to people.",

A white Christmas is great. I like chucking a snowball at my boyfriend. And hot chocolate is my favorite. However, why is it so fucking dark? Sunset at 5? Are you kidding me? Im exhausted, time confused, miss the sun, and I swear to God if it rains again at 40 degrees, Im hibernating for the rest of the year. I hate driving in the dark. I have to go outside to get to the basement to do my laundry, which thanks to last nights snow, means going through an inch and half of snow, on top of cold mud, into a rocky cold basement at the bottom of some rickety ice covered steps, just to put something in the washing machine. We have multiple cats, so I have to dump cat boxes daily, which makes a daily run to the trashcan, now in the dark. Driving in the dark. I hate how dark it is. I hate that it looks like midnight at 6 pm. Its just absurd. How do you all survive winter without living in a cocoon of blankets on the bed? Side note, yes I am aware of S. A. D. S, but I have no medically confirmed diagnosis of it currently, though its possible. Confirmed major depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder. TLDR HOW DO I KEEP SANE IN WINTER? ?",

    "College student wondering if checking myself in to a hospital would be the best option— any advice? What was it like/how much did it cost financially? Hi everyone, hoping I can get some advice on what to do in the next couple days. Ive been seriously thinking of killing myself for about fourfive months definitely had suicidal thoughts before that for many many years, but I didnt start thinking it though or planning anything out until now. Im starting to finally feel like Im reaching the end, lol. I genuinely believe that I do not have the capacity to harm myself in any way, significantly or even slightly. So I kind of feel like Id be lying when I tell them I have intent thats more than just thoughts, although I do have many plans Im hoping I can go through with when Ive finally reached my limit so Im afraid they wont admit me anyways. Im trying to weigh the proscons of trying to get myself admitted and so far Ive only been able to come up with cons My worriesconcerns  I have no idea how much a stay or checking myself in would cost. I believe that this worrying would leave me off a lot worse than I am now. Id also be worrying about what my friendsfamily are thinking while Im gone and how Im just causing them unnecessary stress itd be a shock for them as they dont know any of this  Id also be worrying about missing my classesassignmentsa midterm and how I would catch up afterward  I feel like Id be generally miserable for however long Im there  I think it might make me miserable enough to actually commit suicide after I leave, although I feel like I wouldnt be able to effectively kill myself and then would have to go through the whole process of hospitalization over again. I just dont see that many pros in checking myself in, but I dont really know what else to do. Could anyone whos gone through the process give some guidance? Thank you.",

But this is the best I can do at the moment. ampx200B One thing I see a lot is to make time for you. Make time for yourself. I have been struggling for months to figure out what this really means. Is it being productive? Or is it just being relaxed and leisurely? Is it a moment of quiet? Is it doing some sort of hobby? I wanted to see if anyone had ideas of what it would mean. ampx200B I have a feeling that it can mean any of those things, but what is the ultimate goal? How should you feel after making you time?",

I usually acknowledge the need for medication after a particularly hard low point. I take them everyday until I feel like Im in a good place. I even start wondering if it even does anything and if I even need it. So I stop. A considerable amount of time later, I start circling the drain, going from lethargic to suicidal. Honestly, sometimes I even start wondering if Im depressed or just sad. It does hit hard, but it doesnt stay as long as majorly depressed. Two weeks is long for me. I think thats why I keep telling myself I can handle it without the meds. Part of it is the disdain I feel for people who say theyre depressed so easily just because something marginally upsetting happened to them. I start thinking Do I really have it that bad?

    "I'm so tired This years been shit, I just cant deal with it anymore. Ive tried so hard to be strong and do everything i could to feel better but its just gotten too much. Last year during summer I felt awful, no other way to describe it. Originally I thought it was from the quarantining, not seeing my friends, having to see the really state of the world that time was a very cold realization to a lot of problems in my country that just left me confused, sad and annoyed, but the more I looked for answers the more confusing it got. I just wouldnt feel better, Id sleep all day, not have the motivation to do anything I used to like, it was awful. Seeing friends and being around them apparently covered up a lot of what Ive been feeling. I spoke to a therapist towards the end of summer and it was pretty obvious I had an actual form of depression. In retrospect its probably been there for a while. A few years ago I remember random bouts of feeling miserable despite everything in my life seemingly going well, along with it hitting like a truck when things went poorly. Last year I remember not really doing anything I enjoyed, even basic things like turning on a game felt monumental, let along sitting down and drawing something, so for months on end I just didnt. Talking to a friend also made me realize just how far back it went, I dont really remember it at all but he told me about a time in seventh grade where I told him I was depressed. So here I am almost a year after its been diagnosed, a complete mess. Back to the end of summer, throughout the entire thing i fought with my family a lot, they didnt exactly care for the whole deadly virus thing and kept taking us out to see people. It was really confusing for me, it seemed so simple just wear a mask and stay home for a while to keep other people safe, but here I was arguing with my parents about how we shouldnt be going out. Thats when the topic of school opening came up, there was a virtual and hybrid option, I wanted to stay home and they were dead set on getting me back in.",
    "I don't know what to do... This is the third time I have posted on reddit asking for help after July. As I mentioned earlier, my mental health has degraded a lot during this lockdown. I dont have anybody I can talk to....no friends, no trustables or anything. My parents dont believe the existence of mental health in children so If I tell them that I am experiencing extreme mood swings and depression I get the answer dont be sad or if you will be sad it will become a habit. I need to get back to normal quickly because I am having an important exam. And my parents have indirectly told me that they are going to judge me. I am always feeling hopeless and anxious and worried and depressed. I feel like crying the entire day but I dont because it doesnt changes anything.",
    "I can’t describe what i felt anymore It will be 2months already since she broke up with me. I already give up to the thoughts that we will be back from each other cause its really impossible. Shes already happy with her someone new. For me I already accept it and its good to know that shes happy already. But its still hurt a lot to the point that theres no more tears to cry. My chest is feeling numb to the pain that Im feeling. My emotions is like a roller coaster right now Im feeling hurt later. I feel empty sad and later on i feel nothing no emotion. I dont know at what point of life is me right now",
    "How do I stop fucking myself over? Hey guys so Ive been making some really bad decisions in my life, on purpose. Like not super terrible life ending decisions, but decisions that I know will make me miserable later, namely starting a habit of not eating and making a character that I really dont want to play because I didnt want to say no DnD is a big thing that I love in life and it also kinda tortures me because Im in a big group, and groups of people were actually a huge part of my trauma. My new character starts tomorrow and itll almost definitely make DnD as bad as school is, but I keep telling myself I deserve the pain Im going to feel and I really hope the pain I cause myself will push me to suicide real suicide not just chickening out at the last minute. I dont know if I can stop? Thisll probably get lost in new and nobody will care anyways so to the 2 people who see this, sorry for wasting your time.",
    "Ex GF was my life, now what's the point? I posted my story on another sub for some support. Feel free to read itits long. I am just feeling very depressed today. Depressed being an understatement. She was my world. We were going to get married and have a life together. Had our kids name picked out. She told me she couldnt imagine her life without me. Now shes posting pictures with the guy she cheated on me and left me for saying how amazing he is. Hes a loser, no job, no education, cant support her. I would have given her the world. She doesnt love me. Shell never come back to me. Whats the point anymore? I dont care about having a good job or having a lot going for me. The one thing I want in life I cant have. Her. She was my everything. I dont want someone else. I literally dont care about anything in my life anymore. I hate everything. I hate myself. I lost her. I treated her so well but it just wasnt enough. And now shes gone. I dont know what to do. I just wake up, go to work, go to the gym, go to bed and repeat. Every day is the same and my partner is now happy with someone else. What am I supposed to do? I feel broken. Thanks in advance.",
    "I've been alone for so long I think I'm losing communication skills Or when I was in school literally just standing up to turn my paper in made me feel like people would judge me for my appearance or how I walked or whatever. Being in the presence of anyone makes my life significantly more difficult, like I have to play a role in front of them so I cant be judged for being myself.",
    "My problems So my hate is even getting worse to be honest I just hate my friends and everyone. I regret ever meet them to be honest even tho I dont want to think like this. They did nothing wrong I just have deep hate and its annoying it repeats in my head and I want to punch something really bad but I hold it back. Man I am just completely sad like I really am sad man I dont do shit I like anymore I want to find something to numb the pain and I want to hurt my self with something man just dont know what tho. All this verbal abuse shit that I still goes on in my life made me think about love completely different then anyone to be honest I will probably not even ask anyone out to be honest just might not even going to try. Anyone that trys to be nice to me I tend to say thank you but in reality I doubt myself I dont think anyone likes me even my own parents I just dont trust much feelings anymore just does not even matter to me I see it as a joke to be honest. I am probably going back to my really bad phase of depression I think happen in 9th grade even thought of killing myself even if I go back to that phase I wont kill myself Only two of my friends knows this will probably tell them about this shit sooner or later idk",
    "Shitty New Years Worst new year ever My ex fiancé decided to added me on snap and make me relive everything until 3 am when I literally just got over a few days ago? Its been 6 months of radio silence, an email from me, calls with no answer. We were raising my son together his he was 5 months old and we heard nothing from him. His excuse was the same one that he used all throughout our relationship to not be there for us work is killing him. He owns a pizza restaurant.. and hes a control freak so he basically does everything himself even though he pays employees then stressed himself out because hes doing everything and working 16 hours a day. It ended with me asking for 1 hour a week of couple counselling because I know I have issues but he does too and needs to be able to make at least one hour a time a week for his family if it was ever going to work. His message was  I miss you. happy New Years and then from there it turned into him going on about his how shitty his life is without me.. even though apparently I was the reason he had no money ever and now its the same. I live off of less than half of his income, supporting my son in a two bedroom as opposed to his one bed and somehow I have savings, even though I do have some bad spending habits  fast food delivery , and grocery delivery because sometimes Im too anxious to leave the house and I need to cook for my son. Anyway so that was a mess. And then my friend with benefit that I was falling for.. that I thought maybe felt the same because he was driving an hour to see me, bringing me starbucks, offering to teach me how to drive and cook better, talking about maybe meeting my kid in the future, talking about taking me out clubbing after covid cause Ive missed out being a young mom with no help had a New Years party.. didnt even think to invite me and posted on his snap grinding with some girl 10x hotter than me.. so I hate myself so much for thinking maybe I was special, maybe I meant something to someone in 2020 nope..",

    "Am I experiencing bad anxiety? So I 26F have suffered with depression since I was about 14. I had a bit of anxiety maybe when I was around 16 but I never remember it feeling like this. I work 12hr night shifts and I know that probably doesnt help with my low mood but just lately I have been really struggling. Ill lay down to try and rest and my heart will race, so I have to sit up and breathe a few times, my chest gets tight with it sometimes too. I keep thinking horrible thoughts and dont want to leave the house for my shift at night, feeling scared that I wont come back home for some reason. Obviously this is affecting my work, Im meant to be in tonight but I suddenly started panicking for no reason and felt almost homesick and couldnt stand the thought of leaving the house. Im not agoraphobic, Im fine going places but sometimes I just get incredibly scared. I know I need to see a doctor but when Im feeling like this its almost impossible, I just want to stay in my bed where Im safe and warm. Any advice on getting past this?",
    "Advice on being productive when you feel exhausted and done withe everything? I never want to get out of bed but I have to, Ive got my nephew to watch and also my uncle needs help with various things, and my mom as well, and I know Im expected to clean as well, and I have tons of errands that I have to run. But I dont want to do it at all. None of it. Im actually really tired. My doc has referred me to an infectious disease specialist and a rheumatologist but I just dont want to go. I have zero energy and it could very well just be depression. Ive been dealing with these thoughts and emotions for about ten years and have always been very high functioning to the point where if I talk about this to my family no one will believe me or will just say snap out of it. But Im literally so damn tired. No energy. Face on the ground, dont want to get up. I cant push myself anymore like I used to and Id like to dissipate into thin air at this point.",

Ive tried talking about it with a friend but they dont seem interested. There are so many things piling up that stress me out. Thank you",
    "Wife wants space to fight depression Sorry if wrong thread but I feel like maybe people have more first hand experience with something like this. So a month ago, my wife moved out of our home after admitting that her depression has taken its toll on her and she gave me the old quote I love you, but Im not in love with you. We have been married just shy of a year but have been together for 6 years prior to that. She was distraught when she dropped that bombshell on me and I felt my whole world crumble. She is adamant that I havent done anything wrong and that Ive done nothing but care, respect and been loyal to her and she feels ashamed to feel like this, and she just needs to have time and space for her self to figure out herself and if she got into a relationship with me for the right reasons she was in 2 really toxic relationships previously and then started a relationship straight away with me, and she doesnt know if I was a crutch for her or if it was genuine. For a while she has been unhappy with her job, the house we live in and our financial situation finances are now pretty much resolved after making some sacrifices and also with lockdown she has essentially been a prisoner in her own home for 3 weeks. I have given her the perfect opportunity to tell me if she was having an affair. I told her that if she told me the honest truth, I will not react in anger or resentment, and I would just accept her decision and I would have to think things through for a while. She again has been adamant there is nobody else involved. She has booked her self in for councelling with her depression and I think that starts pretty soon. I feel in complete limbo land at the moment and I feel scared and alone and worried about what the future holds. I have made contingency plans if things go south. I speak to friends and family about this situation and the advice is poor at the best of times. People keep telling me that I should give her an ultimatum and pressure her into coming back, which I know is completely wrong and its something I should not do. I have made the conscious decision to fight with every strand of my being to save this marriage and I will not be the one that ends it.",
    "I feel hopelessly inferior to everyone around me Its like there is the level of common understanding or thought that everyone else has but me. Its really hard to put into words because its just a feeling i get when i am outside, or seeing videos on the internet. Its like other people know what to say or how to act in situations im utterly lost in. And I also feel inferior because everyone else has so much experience and i havent had any. I feel like a sheltered baby compared to just my peers. They hook up, they smoketake drugs, go to bars and parties. I dont do any of that, still a fucking virgin. And when conversations inevitably get around to those topics, i feel terrible. I feel inferior, ashamed of myself, and lots guilt and self loathing. I think part of the guilt and self loathing comes from one of my initial reactions being hatred. I dont want to hate them, that doesnt make any sense because i want to be like them and theyre just living their best lives. But i do feel hatred because they not only get to casually do what i have cried myself to sleep wishing i could do. And then i turn that on myself. I shouldnt hate them, im a terrible person for thinking that. Thinking that makes you an incelneckbeardcreep. Its so grating to my ears to hear my neighbor having friends over or parties, or to hear people walking by outside on their way to a party or even just get some food. And i makes me want to slam my head. I know i can never get better if i think like this. But ill probably just never get better, period. Because i suck at socializing. I dont get invited to things. I dont have anyone to invite to get something going myself. I suck. Worthless, sack of shit. Better off dead",
    "Therapist won’t give meds Im a minor with the NHS in the UK. CAMHS. Youre probably thinking that there must be a reason, no. Im this close to ending it all and my therapist will just refuse to let me see the psychiatrist no matter how many times I ask. If I do attempt it will be successful, so its not like Ill have multiple attempts ie. they may give me meds after one. What do I say to get them to think more about giving me them? Theyre so reluctant. I see people complain 247 about how they dish out meds on a platter. But its the opposite for me and there is absolutely no reason.

    "I don’t know what to do anymore Im scared. Im so scared right now. Ive been bottling up every bit of negative emotion, Ive been smiling and saying Im ok. Ive been pretending out of fear.

Nothing is going to change. If I say anything Ill break. If I say anything itll all end. I dont know what to do. I want to talk. I want to scream. But Im afraid of being shoved away like I usually am. Im afraid of being hurt again for saying how Im really feeling. Im afraid of being called crazy. I cant speak about whats really going on. Ive smiled and laughed and small talked my way through these months of torture. The sun is shining yet a hurricane is raging inside of me. I cant take it. I cant talk. I cant do anything. Its getting harder and harder to lie. I lie everyday, my very existence is in itself a lie. I want to tell somebody, but who do I tell? Who is left? The smile is crumbling. Im afraid when it comes off Ill break, literally. Im afraid that itll end in an outburst. Im afraid. Im so afraid. the plans, crying while everyone else slept, screaming in my head as I say Im ok to my therapist. if I tell the truth, Ill suffer worse consequences. Im so stupid. I want to tell. But I cant. I just cant. I want help, but I cant get it.

    "I'm a College Student Struggling with Depression Ive been struggling with depression for years. Im hoping to graduate in the spring, but I wont if I dont get myself back into shape. Last year wasnt so bad, but its really hit me hard this semester. I had to withdraw from a class and am behind in all my others. I keep making lists of the things I need to do and try to take them one at a time, but since Ive missed so much class and everything is already going to be penalized for being late, I feel like its becoming impossible. Getting help right now isnt really an option. I was supposed to get a scholarship this year but its delayed because of some confusing financial thing, so Im out of cash. I dont have enough for even one copay, or pay for transportation to see a psychologist. Professors are emailing me about assignments and Ive been giving excuses for months. The school wont give me accommodations because my diagnosis is too old. I dont get financial or emotional support from my family so thats out. All I can do is try to go to class and do the work, which makes it all the more stressful. I feel like Im always loosing time and never making progress. I try to do a little here and there but I cant seem to keep up my focus or motivation. I just want to be able to get the things done and feel better, at least about being a semidecent student.

    "depression is making me F[15] flunk out of high school I F15 have always been a super academic student athlete, getting high 80s and 90s throughout middle school and into about halfway through ninth grade, when the depression started to kick in. it wasnt as bad as it is now, but my grades started to get significantly lower. This school year tenth grade my academics are horrendous. I have failed math in 23 terms 51 first term, dropped into 40s for 2nd term and my science grade was in the mid 60s for term 1 and i think i failed term 2. I have no motivation to bring myself to do anything anymore. I can barely leave my bed. I am a competitive dancer and have always been super passionate and serious about it, and now i just dont care any anymore. My dad who has been apart of my whole life but not really at the same time because hes a drunk ashle is in critical condition and is dying. I dont know if its because of the emotional trauma and physical abuse he has caused me throughout the years, but i also feel numb to him dying. i feel like i wont even give a shit when hes gone and i know that sounds absolutely awful but i seriously dont feel anything I honestly have no idea how to deal with this right now, because my mom doesnt really believe im depressed and wont take me to a therapist. I know 10th grade is the most important year for math and science academics where i live and i honestly feel like its too late to fix anything. now i cant help but think im going to flunk out of high school and end up working at a gas station for the rest of my life someone please give me some sort of direction or guidance on what i could possibly do because i feel really lost and confused right now, and im terrified about my future with my poor academics right now edit sorry if theres a bunch of grammatical errors, its late at night and i didnt feel like proof reading this before i posted it.",

In the past Ive fell into pretty bad bouts of depression and in the process for some time I couldnt even bring myself to brush my teeth or shower. That was a while ago, not recently. Since then Ive been much healthier and Ive built a solid morning routine where as soon as I get up I shower and brush my teeth.

    "“I Don’t Care What You Think… This Is Between Me And God Now.” I have always looked up to my older cousin, Jim. He was truly one of the three men I admire most credit Don McLeans American Pie. And then, as if my current struggles with depression havent been bad enough, this week he tore me apart over a situation that he was completely ignorant about. He took one persons totally distorted version of events a diplomatic way of saying that he believed someone elses delusional lies and wouldnt even consider my side of the story. I tried so hard to get him to understand what I was doing and why. But he just wouldnt listen and continued to so very unfairly condemn me. Jim hurt me so badly. And he broke my heart. I was at a loss for what to do next. Then I thought about what my Dad would say in a similar situation. He wasnt a very big man physically, but he was one tough little SOB. And though he passed three years ago, I still find comfort and inspiration from his words of wisdom. So I told Jim that Ive given this situation a great deal of thought and prayer. Im doing what I believe is right. And if he doesnt like it, with all due respect, I dont care. This is between me and God now. Jim had no answer. And his abusive attacks stopped. Thanks Dad. I love you, man. And I miss you",
    "I ( 26 female ) have decided to take care of my severely depressed younger brother (20m ) by letting him move in with me last week and need some tips. He is 20, however never grew up or matured properly due to lack of socialization... Never experience love, only had friends before his teens and made virtual friends via his gaming on Xbox until this day... While my mom drank and my dad was aggressive all these years, my brother would go hide in his room gaming all night and sleping all day and hasnt left his room until child protective services took him out for 1.5 years. And they only did because I told them what was going on... Anyways. Fast forward and now he is finally with me. I want to be the best support but I havent stopped feeling anxiety since he moved in. Like I am not eating as well and I am worried this will make me feel isolated or ruin my other relationships  dont have many left haha but 23 but also worried for him too as he wont eat unless I tell him to, wont move his body unless I tell him to etc... Having him here reminds me of the misery of my parents and my childhood. Because he is unfortunately the result of a dysfunctional family. I dont want to turn into my mom where I cook and clean all the time  she is a functioning alcoholic but gets highly abusive when she drinks but still cooked and cleaned  even though I cooked for.myself growing up as Im vegan and she didnt want to cook vegan food for me when I turned 19. I want my brother to feel confident but he doesnt because he dropped out of highschool twice as a result of mental illness growing up. Before coming to stay with me he was starring to refuse food and had severe psychomotor retardation  cant get our of bed  and like I maybe mentioned before he has not gotten out of bed in a decade expect for when CPS got involved .

    "Advice to an 18 y/o depressed closeted bisexual dude who mostly has anti-lgbt religious family &amp; friends and is contemplating suicide? this post got no replies in the depression subreddit so here I go Im an 18 yo dude. Im starting my first year of college this August. Ive been thinking about coming out as bi to a few friends that I care about and ones I hold dear, but Im afraid of what might happen if I do it. Were all Christians my familys Catholic. I know a lot of people I care about wont approve of me whenif I come out. I project myself as this straight guy whos just an allysupporter for LGBTQ rights. Ive fought with some religious friends as I defended the topic of samesex civil unions online amp offline. Its been about 10 months since I last went to a Sunday church service where I used to talk to some friends who go to church there. I still go to my neighborhood Catholic church because of my dad who put me in the choir along with my brother. My dads also the president of our Catholic church choir. Hes also VERY outspoken about being antiLGBTQ. I find it hard to come out to my family because were super religious Catholics. There was a time when my Born Again Christian cousin female came out, they recommended her to go to conversion therapy. I was one of the few family members who know this along with my older other cousin and some of my unclesaunts. I wont be coming out to my family. Maybe not yet. Or maybe not ever, considering the factors Ive just mentioned. My dad and I would probably fight if my family finds out. Its ironic that its hard to be open to your own family whom you share the same house with. Still havent catch up with a friendchurch leader from churchschool. I feel bad for ghostingavoiding friends from this church I used to go to Born Again Christian. The last time I went to that church was July 2018. Theres this one friend, lets call him Matthew, who used to be my youth group leader and is also a fan of RuPauls Drag Race and Queer Eye.",
    "I’m drowning and I don’t know what to do Sometimes I think that maybe I dont really know what I want. I hate it. I hate how I look at other people and hate them. I hate when they smile, I hate when they laugh I hate how fucking happy everyone else is. Im being left behind. I know I am, everyone is so far ahead of me and Im drowning in my own damn mind. I cant keep this up. I cant keep smiling and pretending Im cool with being the lonely asshole who stays in her room all day. Who only goes outside to go to class or to get some unhealthy shit that shell feel bad about ten minutes later. I dont think I want to die. I just... I want to be free. But maybe freedom is death for me. I want to hit something. I want to yell and scream but at the same time I just want someone to hug me and tell me that its okay and that I matter. But that wont happen. Not in a way thats genuine and real, its all fucking pretend to make people feel better and act like they actually care for the small lonely bitch who tries too hard to not care at all. If Im alone then maybe its better for me to leave anyway, fully embrace it instead of begging for some kind of helping hand. No one would really care if I go. I give them three months tops until I just become a distant name they remember every so often. Everything is so loud but painfully silent at the same time why cant it stop I want everything to just fucking stop. I tried to get help last year but they just pretended to care about me to. They read straight off a damn script. Didnt take long for me to figure out the pattern and say what I needed to get out. I dont know what to do anymore. I feel like this my final chance to ask for help before I go back into a hole I may not be able to escape from again. I dont trust anyone and those few that I do hole a level of trust for I dont want to burden them so I smile and play it off as some edgy joke.",
    "How do I support my girlfriend who is struggling with depression? Hi, first time poster here, I hope this is an appropriate post for this board. My girlfriend is struggling with depression, probably stemming from childhood trauma unstable family situation, regular police presence in the house. She is taking large doses of venlafaxine 225mg for 120lb body weight to cope with her illness, but it can only do so much. She often has problems controlling her anger, which is related to the point of this post, because when she is in a depressed mood, anger is often the only way she can really communicate. She recently had a complete nervous breakdown in the car I was driving, over an argument we had. It ended with her calling an ambulance on herself to be taken to emergency psychiatric care. She is now considering some time in a psychiatric institution for herself. Now here comes my main questions She often has these breakdowns, where she often can only shout and scream, or completely retreat. She describes it as such She can either scream, or say nothing and retreat to sleep for a day. I have found that I am very unhelpful for her in these moments. I am a very careful person, and I think a lot before doing anything. She says she needs guidance and structure in these moments. How can I support her in those moments? I have tried to give her clear instructions in those moments in the past, but it has not worked well. I think my personality type just does not make it very credible if I say Calm down, were doing X now, because I dont behave like that in a noncrisis situation. I think her anger is often a frustration about her inability to deal with her illness. Unfortunately, her behavior in those moments also scares me. So I am even more timid to help her. Not that I am scared that she will hurt me or anything, but I am scared of making it worse. Also, I quickly become frustrated if i try something and it does not work, which is an issue I need to work on. ampx200B TLDR How do I support my depressed girlfriend during a mental breakdown? Anyone out there who can relate to her behavior and knows what works for them? Any advice welcome!",
    "Making friends while having depression I have no friends. Plain and simple I dont have any, I didnt really fit in high school and Ive always had difficulties making friends. I think on some level I dont really understand people or how I should act around people. I am extremely awkward and dont talk much because Im scared of putting my foot in my mouth Ive done it a lot before, like Ive asked what I thought was a innocent question or remark before not realizing that it wasnt okay thing to say and not understanding why its rude. I am extremely lonely and not having anyone makes it hard to want to live. How do I go about making friends when at almost 25 while semi in a pandemic?",
    "I’m in a good place in my life rn, why am I feeling this way I cant understand why Im still feeling depressed after so many years even though I took up a hobby I love, going to college for something Im passionate about, in a healthy relationship, and having a stable job. There are days where I feel completely fine, and then Ill have a mental breakdowndepressive episode and usually after one I tend to have more for a week or two. I wont talk for hours, I keep replaying what caused me to feel that way, and then thats it I just bottle it up. I hold onto grudges from my dark past and Its really hard to stop. And its been going on since I was a child. I try to be mindful and think of ways to communicate it to either my SO friend family member but I struggle with communicating in general. I have a really hard time translating my thoughtsfeelings in generaI, literally about anything into words. I just give up on being social sometimes because if I try all I do is stutter. It makes me feel like no one takes me seriously and sees me as intelligent. Because of this Im scared to help, say my opinion, or engage in insightful conversations. I dont feel useful. Though why I do I feel all of this if my life from an outer perspective is more than fine, and privileged. I have a supporting SO, and friends. But, I cant seem to trust them, too. They havent given me a reason not to, so I dont why I keep treating them as if theyre going to hurt me like the people in my life before. Im in a really good place right now, but why do I still feel deeply depressed. Its getting harder to cope, and Im struggling to find healthy outlets rn to release my traumastress. I just need someone to hold my hand and sit in silence with me.",
    "Help me, please. I have 0 friends in the literal sense. I have been living like this for more than 3 years I try to contact my first and old friends in Facebook and although they enthusiastically answer we can never get together, and even if we could I would be so embarassed to share with them what my life has become. I have learned to live with it, especially after I got psychological support for some months last semester and even if talking to a therapist was a great relief I felt it was useless. When I was in therapy I was reading at the same time some books of selfimprovement but that only created in me a temporary but potent energy and when this energy disappeared I returned to this drab, insipid state. I was in a very decent social circle when I was in school I am not from the US so this will be difficult to explain, I studied where the rich people and the children of important persons of my country studied so I had what you call good connections and in here you start with the same classmates when you are 3 years old and end with the same classmates when you are 1718 so we graduate very close to each other emotionally. I feel like I have left that circle and I cant return, I dread that situation of me presenting myself again to those persons and it feels that as years pass they get closer together while I isolate myself more. My mom always says that University is the best time of the life because you party, go with friends are more independent, and you begin to flourish, grow up and create good or bad experiences. Not for me, I feel like I am in standby, I just watch people have fun. Today I observed my classes to see if there was anyone else like this but everyone had at least one person to talk to. You may say that it is ok to not party if you dont like although I do like to party from times to times and get drunk, its just there isnt anybody I can do that with and even if I didnt like to go to clubs I see everyone with different interests and mindsets forming groups according to what they like, WHY DO I FEEL LIKE I AM NOT PART OF ANY GROUP??? I feel like I dont have any identity that I can show, I feel empty because I have a big fear of being judged for what I am.",

    "Please help, my girlfriend is depressed, I have no idea what to do. M, Both 14 years old. Ive felt Depression. I remember there was a time where I hated going to sleep because when I was left alone in the dark with my thoughts, all I ever heard them say is how fucking horrible life is and how much I wanted to kk myself, and I would fall asleep every night knowing I would wake up the next day with no motivation or reason to get out of bed. Every day was dull and empty, every second was a living hell. I had no appetite, lost alot of weight, lost the will to live, god I hated everything. Eventually things got better, but to be honest its kinda been happening again. Lifes been pretty good for me, materialistically, I have good friends, my relationships with family are good, I have an amazing girlfriend, its not as bad as it used to be, but I still feel like empty shit at times. But this isnt about me. My girlfriend lives a really hard life, which pains me so much because shes an amazing person and only deserves the best. Tonight was going well, we were in a call, we talked, did some homework, talked more, and then she left the call. Over text she said she wasnt ok and if it was a good time to talk about it, I said of course she can always talk to me. She starts talking about how shes been feeling down lately, how she barely ate today, how she feels empty, and how she cant seem to feel happy at a and oh my god it pains me so much.

    "Looking For Coping Methods My depression has been really declining lately. I live in a really bad household and Im being targeted by my grandfather whom nobody will stand up to and if I try to stand up for myself, Im the one in the wrong.

This especially hurts because him and I used to be friends when my mother was the one being horrible and nasty She calls me disgusting, a few slurs, etc he was the one that was always there to comfort me and try and talk it out with her.

Its an incredible struggle to eat just a meal a day, my lips are getting torn because I pick at them, I cant ever get to sleep and stay asleep, its frustrating and since Im a teenager I cant leave this enviroment. What do I do to cope? I use music to try and melt away, I play games like animal crossing to stay distracted, I draw, I play ukulele, I just breathe and try to remember that it will pass. Im terrified of being suicidal, Ive attempted once and was lucky I know Im capable even if I dont want to and that scares me. What are some methods you guys use to deal with these sort of things?

    "How to get brave enough to kill yourself PLEASE NOTE I am not in any danger to myself at this time so no need for urgency. TLDR self hate, worthlessness, getting over fear of death. Im just so tired of living. Ive always hated myself and people since a very early age and I cannot trust anyone. I feel absolutely wrong in this world. Everything I do or say or think is wrong. Since day one I was wrong. I cant do anything right like honestly not trying to exaggerate here and cant make any connections with anyone. Im actually unable to feel love or compassion or any sort of human connection. Dont even get me started on sex Im sick of watching everyone else get what I cant have. I dont deserve love or kindness and Im honestly sick of being the brunt of a very boring joke. I feel like the universe is constantly telling me I dont belong here I also feel like Im not THAT important to have the universe specifically pick on me. My role in this world is to be unremarkable and useless. I only see evil in the world, I can see no kindness. As long as there is man men, there can be on peace. Since the dawn of time weve chosen violence, death and hate. Even in the 21st century we still are starting wars, having genocides and famine and humans are becoming less and less human or more human?? I cant hold onto friendships or make any solid connections. I can only make friend with people who need someones shoulder to cry on and once theyre done with me, theyre gone. I also cling onto anyone that stays remotely too long and then feel utterly betrayed by the smallest problem they face me with. I freak out at the smallest things like dropping a spoon or having a giant mess. I used to be able to pretend to be happy and healthy and human but, as usual, I cant do that right so Im slipping. I cant stay at a job for longer than a year without freaking out. I work at a job Ive wanted for so long but see how little work or care is actually put in by my fellow coworkers and its maddening.",

Any of my friends or family members Ive spoken to have told me it will get better and Im a great dude but it just doesnt make me feel any less worthless to myself. Id appreciate anything anyone has to say. Thanks.",

    "I think I’m slipping into insanity Hey all, need a bit if supportadvice As of recently, Ive noticed Ive been having a lot more breakdowns than I usually have. These have gotten to the point where Ive begun to push the important people out of my life. On the flip side, I dont do anything with my life. Besides the global quarantine we currently have due to COVID, I just.... do nothing. I feel bad because I have no job, so Im constantly asking for money from my parents, which I then spend like a madman, and, again, I just sit at home and play video games all day, despite telling myself to do other things. This, along with recent events, has left me highly aggressiveabrasive. Thing is, I recognize that this is not me, and Im basically trapped under impulse. What can I do? Is this Psych Ward or MRIworthy? Does anyone know of ways I can get help online or through an app?",
    "Im scared i will never have friends again I have had major depression and anxiety my entire life, but i stopped seeing a counselor years ago. In 2016 i had friends that i would hang out with that were also my coworkers. We drifted apart and its my fault. After getting a different job i had a lot of coworkers and some would ask to hangout with me, but i always refused. Something changed in me where i began to completely self isolate and push away anyone who tried to come close to me. Im an introvert, so i keep trying to convince myself that i dont want friends. But the truth is im scared of never having friends again. I realized that truly the only close friends i have in my life are my boyfriend that i live with, my mom, and my boss. Im grateful for them, but i feel self conscious because i dont have any other friends my age. I deleted all my social media because seeing my old friends hangout together hurts, as well as seeing posts of people with their friend groups. I waste too much time comparing myself to others. But now i feel 10 times more lonely without social media. How do i get out of this? I am too scared to reach out to old friends. Is it normal to have no friends? Have you gone through something similar? I would love to make online friends but i dont know how. I feel so alone, especially now that corona virus has taken away my job and i have no reason to go outside. I quit college recently too so its really hard for me to meet new people.",

I want to take a semester off due to an all time low in motivation. Id rather not wasted my parents money and instead spend that time getting a job, seeing a therapist, working out, really just getting better. The problem with telling them I dont want to go this semester is I have to have a good reason and Id rather not lie to them. They know about my anxiety which is hard enough for me to deal with sometimes but them knowing I have depression is a whole other thing. And I know its not as bad as my brain is telling me it is but I cant help it.

    "Meds help - Sertraline Please help lol. TLDR at the bottom. I started taking Citalopram 5 years ago and tried to ween myself off them. When I did that, after I stopped taking them any little thing would make me angry or burst into tears. I was surprised at how much the meds actually effected me. So I asked doctor if I can change my meds entirely and went onto Sertraline, 50mg. I recently decided I dont want to be on these meds forever, and asked my Dr how do I stop them? He was no help whatsoever and said just half them etc and take it ever other day etc. I did that and now Im off them. But Ive noticed my moods changed. Any little thing that doesnt go right, I get really angry and I could burst into tears. Seriously all the time. Has anyone come off these and experienced what Im going through? Does it stop? Do you start to feel normal again? TLDR  Weened myself off Sertraline, little things that go wrong make me angry and cry. Does this stop? Will I feel normal again? When?",

The issue is that I find myself unmotivated to do much of anything and when I do engage in activities I dont really find much value in participating in them because I dontenjoy them. Because of this, it causes a selffulfilling prophecy as I dont make the effort to do things because I find nothing enjoyable.

Ive always turned to some form of escapism as a coping strategy, whether its gaming, cartoons, or even just watching random YT videos. Now, I feel like I would just be happier if I could live in that escapism all the time. If there was a way I could just spend my life sleeping and dreaming all the time, I would. Even my therapist has acknowledged that life wont be as much fun as living in a gaming world or watching cartoons, so whats the point? So far, the main answer seems to be you just have to do it.

At this point, I feel so incurable nothing has helped. I have seen my therapist for a year, seemed professional medical help, took the numerous amount of pills and have not felt the slightest bit better. Things have gotten worse than before. I have laundry piling up in the corner of my room and at this point I just pull out any clean clothes I can find in my dresser. Showers?

To be honest, my depression has just spiraled out of control at this point. I cant look at myself in the mirror and hate everything about myself internally, externally and mentally. I hate myself and the people I am hurting. I could have a good day, but at the end of the day my suicidal thoughts still sit in the back of my head.

    "How do I (14 M) talk to my (Typical Indian) dad about seeing a therapist? Tldr at bottom Hey guys. So, for context I am a 14 yo dude from India. I have a typical Indian dad, so that means conservative and not so openminded, and we arent close either.

I told him they were cuts with a razor blade and he didnt ask me why but instead started screaming at me about me not studying and that I cut myself because of Youtube As it had rotten my brain. He told me that he would have listened to me and helped if I had gotten good grades Like, above 95 but since I havent gotten good grades I have like a 7580 overall, he doesnt give a fuck. I couldnt even tell him about what was bothering me. The first thing I said was insecurities, and he said I dont know the first thing about being insecure. Then I said anxiety and he went on and on about how I have no anxiety and its all just due to Youtube. This went on and on and I just stopped speaking. Like half an hour in, he told me that I should just take a knife and slice my wrists so I can die once and for all and how it would be great and he wouldnt give a shit This was pretty descriptive. He told me exactly where to cut and how much time it would take me to die. Also, to slice them in the bathroom sink so the bedroom doesnt get dirty After like 1.52 weeks after this convo, he came into my room and told me that he got irritated because he couldnt understand what caused me to do it and he had cried later that night. Now I dont know if I should believe him or not.",

    "I want to go home I F, 19 am a sophomore in college. I have a wonderful family my three siblings and I are extremely close, and our parents love us and each other. I know Im very lucky for that. I grew up on a small farm in the desert, and we were dirt poor. Our house was a hundred years old and was built from adobe and railroad ties. The plywood floors had holes in them that snakes and mice would come through, and my sister and I shared a bed until I was twelve. I remember times when all we had to eat was what we had left over from the previous harvest and the animals we had raised. My summers were spent working our land and taking trips with my friends from church and school to the muddy river that only flowed with the snowmelt in the spring and the torrential monsoons in the summer. We always had dogs and barn cats and chickens. It was so simple and easy, and I loved that farm and my life with my whole heart. When I was 15, we moved to a city a few hours away and kept the farm. Wed go up on weekends to take care of little projects, and I would get to see the friends Id grown up with. I never felt like I had really moved away. Ive since started college in a town much closer to my farm, and I go to visit often. My dad stayed up there for work and stays in a trailer we brought up. He takes care of our chickens and farms in the warmer months. Our work weekends are more scattered now that all the kids are grown and moved away. Our house is uninhabitable now and the land is going wild again. Coming home just isnt the same anymore. Lately, all I want, and all I can think about, is to go home. Not just making the drive and seeing my dad and the farm. I fantasize about waking up in the morning in my bed, 10 again, snuggled with my sister against the cold and the wind howling outside. I want to be with my family the way we were when we all lived under the same roof and to work in the garden and take walks through the desert with my brother, looking for elk and coyote tracks in the river basin.",

    "How do people cope with life moving past them so quickly I feel stuck in time. I feel like everyone around me if growing so much and Ive been stuck in the same place. My life has progressed, but I just feel the same. Theres so many people who once were in my life who I dont see anymore, people I worked with, people I went to school with. Its so crazy that all these people who were once in my life and now are so far away. I feel so much guilt for not keeping in contact but I guess thats just getting older. I struggle the most with my ex, I just dont know how Im supposed to heal from losing someone you spent years of your life with. Im over him and have been with someone else for over a year now, I love him. But it all still hurts. I am so bored of my life here. Im bored of walking to work, making dinner, watching some tv and then going to bed. I wish my spirit could leave this flesh prison and just experience all the love and nature in the world.",

    "Feeling at the end of the line My wife knows about my rape and thanks to her I was able to talk to my sister about it too, needless to say I broke my sisters heart but also made us closer, she also was kind enough to pay for private professional help for me and her to deal with this, I also opened about this with an uncle my mothers brother who I thought was someone completely different to what he turned out to be, when I told him about the rape he broke hard and I took him to talk with the therapist I was seeing thanks to my sister, and what she told me before the therapist and told to him later changed everything, she said that I needed some sort of compensation for what had happened in order to move on, it wasnt possible to get legal justice due the time frame of the events and the lack of evidence beyond my word and she didnt suggest anything more beyond that we should try to figure it out, of course telling the whole family was my first thought and let the truth have its day, but my uncle mothers brother begged me not to tell anything because it would destroy the family, specially my mother who has a lot, and I mean a lot of love for the uncle who raped me, she my mother basically raised him the first 4 years of his life because his parents had a busy and privileged life and he the rapist is seen by the rest of the family as a great guy and an example, with this he mothers brother convinced me not to tell anything, I know I could have just said no and told everything to everyone but thinking what could I possibly put my mother through after seeing how his brother took the news made me feel trapped and basically Ive been living feeling like a prisoner and the responsible for my entire family being together or not. My dear wife, my love, only she keeps me sane holding me when Im about to broke and unfortunately with all that Ive mentioned before about not being able to get a job it has begun to be a frequent occurrence and I can see it is taking a toll on her, Ive busted my eyes and my back studying and working hard on small jobs non related to my career just to keep us going and whenever seems to be an opportunity all I get are rejections or I get to watch people getting jobs because of political favors, and what has led me here is the thought that I am the common factor in all of this, and everyone specially my wife would be better off if I am no more, we would love to be able to begin a family but it would be so irresponsible to bring a child to this world under this circumstances, and this also makes my wife so sad, she cries in my shoulder but tells me that we will pass this and everything will be fine, but Ive lost almost all hope, and given our age and financial situation it looks that if she keeps being by my side she will never have the family and the life she deserves.",

This is the first time I write about my inner feelings, especially at these times outer war with Hamas in Gaza, and inner war with farright IsraeliArabs and Farright Jews. Im a happy person. Got a good job, great and supportive partner. I love living, curious on everything life has to offer. from baking, coffee, to movies and games, to travel and cultures around the world. Im keeping myself healthy with vitamins and doing Tim Ferriss 4 Hour Body diet and exercises. Not watching too much public television and getting some news oncetwice a day. Every day Im working from 9 to 6, ending with some different relaxation daily. For the last week, everything around me is changing. It has started with the famous issues in Jerusalem, and later started to go south. Sirens went off every evening, and woke us up every night between 1am and 3am, and also 7pm and 9pm. With every siren, we have 130min to get to a safe area. In that safe area, Im meeting every neighbor that lives around me, some elderly, some couples, and young families, which the mothers are crying out loud from the pressure. Once 130min have passed, we wait for the missiles to get hit by our irondome, or unfortunately fall. Yesterday one missile hit 5 kilometers from me. While this missiles and hits in Gaza is going on  inside the country, in cities where Arabs and Jews living together  theres literally an anarchy. If you look like a jew, orthodox mostly  youll get hit, kicked, and now will be shot. If you look like an arab, youll get hit, kicked, and probably be shot. There was not enough police to keep the area cool. Small groups in their hundreds, are traveling to these cities to protect their people. Jews, Arabs, it doesnt matter. synagogues burnt down, people being pull over and being hit by rocks. You need to identify in front of gangs if you are an arab or a jew. Either  youll be in grave danger. It needs ti be called a civil war non the less.",

    "I took my best friend to Florida for a getaway in the hopes that it would help my depression. Worst. Mistake. Ever. Hi, first time posting here and Im kinda a wreck right now so sorry if the formatting is a bit off. So, Ive been struggling with very severe depression, and even suicidal thoughts. Ive been in touch with a mentor, and I suggested going to FL I live in Virginia, and I have family in Florida and she thought that would be a good idea, you know, get away from everything for a few days. So, I booked the trip and invited my best friend who will remain nameless to go with me. He quickly agreed especially since hes been on suicide watch for me for over 3 months and we got out tickets and all was dandy. Today, day 2 of said trip, Ive completely lost my friend to the Fortnite video game. Ive tried to do stuff with him, he politely declines. Ive tried to talk to him, but as soon as I get sick unfortunately, my main stress coping mechanism is vomiting, completely involuntary. I dont force it he goes ba k to the game and when I need him the most when Ive hit my lowest point moments ago he leaves. LEAVES!! Im at the end of my rope and I dont know what to do. I feel completely alone. Even my family all except my dad have used me out completely and taken to my friend instead. I dont know what to do, Ive never felt so alone while Im surrounded by 8 of my closest family members and my best friend. Please help me. I dont know how else to end this. Please help me.",
    "Am I the Only One? Hi, Im somewhat new to the Reddit community but feel somewhat comfortable discussing heavy topics. So, please please dont be mean. I have dealt with depression and anxiety for a long time now but just recently got diagnosed and have been getting help for it. To keep it short, when I keep heavy thoughts bottled up inside for too long I explode. For me, I started cutting a year ago but havent done it in a few months but prefer to hit my face. Ive done this for a while but not to the point of leaving a wound. However, recently Ive noticed that I leave noticeable bruises on my face. I cant control the rage and feel awful afterwards but then i want to do it again. When it gets to a certain point, Im suicidal and tend to somewhat blackout when I hit myself. I hate thinking about this but it happened recently and now I have a bruise under my eye. Im reaching out to see if anyone else does this. Every time I do this, I wear a lot of makeup or stay home because Im ashamed and embarrassed that I did this to myself. I havent told anyone besides my boyfriend, counselor, and doctor so I dont know what others think about this. Only a few people have noticed a bruise on one occasion when I was in the darkest time and automatically thought my boyfriend did something. I felt terrible and I wanted to punish myself more. My boyfriend is one of the few reasons why Im still here. Any opinions and thoughts would be nice. I just feel so lost and confused. Thank you.",
    "How do I help my girlfriend My girlfriend 27 has slowly been sinking into depression, and I have no clue as to how I can help her. These last few months have been tough on her especially the last two. Her parents have started talking about divorce and its beginning to get ugly between them. Her mother calls her and vents about it and it usually leaves her angry. Her brother who has recently moved out of their parents house in January was just put in a psych ward for evaluation because his schizophrenia and paranoia have gotten the better of him since hes moved out. This is his second time being admitted. My girlfriend had a tremendous amount of pressure put on her for the last couple months from her parents to watch over him since they live out of town. Since hes been admitted her depression has crept up on her. Shes doesnt want to do anything but sleep and cry. Im always there by her side but do give her space for her self so that Im not overbearing on her. Lately shes been going on about how she wishes she could just end it all and kill herself because all her pain would go away and it would be easier. This isnt the first time shes said something along these lines. Shes never tried to hurt herself in that sort of way, but it does concern me. Shes been visiting a therapist lately and it seems to help her a bit but its only been her 3rd session, and she hasnt completely opened up on the subject with her. This morning she texted me that I havent been giving her the attention she needsdespite being with her and doing everything for her when I come home from work. Im trying really hard to help lift t her spirits and nothing picks her up. Even the dates we try to have do help. Half way through she wants to call it a night so she can go home to sleep and lay down. Im not sure what to do anymore.

Ive recently moved in with him. I cook and clean for him, chat to him when he wants to chat. He says he doesnt need help or he cant be helped, that hes independent but does thank me any time I do stuff for him. I want to show him hes loved and tell him this. He thinks Im being emotional and not to worry about him. Ive suggested trying different meds, going with him to talk to someone, taking time off work to trial different meds, he agrees he needs time off though feels bad to his team at work amp his boss. I guess I just need advice on what I can do to help and not be overbearing or annoying to him. Hes gotten a lot worse these past few weeks and I cant help but think Its my fault or Im doing something wrong. I cant say Ive ever been in his position so Im at a loss on what to do.",

Its been roughly a year, I recently moved out of my parents house around this time last year. And its all gone to shit... I guess I rushed into adulthood faster then I should. Was promised a job from my mother in law. That only lasted 3 weeks. Ive been bouncing from warehouse to warehouse job for the last year. I feel disconnected from my own life. Worthless... like I dont belong. My relationship with my SO is rough. Theres days where its the ideal relationship, and days where I feel like Im the only one loving and actually trying. My relationship with my own family is little to none. I dont have the courage to say whats really going on. Idk I would rather people not care about me. Not worry or pressure me about whats going on. But Im at the end of my road and my last options are dark. I cant keep a job, cant keep a place, cant hold a conversation with family and friends. Im so numb and hollow. I cry randomly throughout the day, suicidal scenarios play out in my head all throughout the day. What if I wasnt around? People wouldnt have to worry. I wouldnt have to live a life I feel like I dont deserve. Ive contemplated actually doing it numerous times. Just cant choose on how and where as in stuck babysitting majority of the days.

    "We were engaged. He left me for a 19 year old he has been talking to online for the past 3 months When he woke up, he sent me a long message apologizing, saying how bad he felt and begged for my forgiveness. Yes I know, Im stupid, but I was going to forgive him. He was telling me that anything I wanted him to do to gain my trust back, to let him know. I told him to block her in all social medias. He did. He sent me screenshots of everything. The long call happened from a Friday night through a Saturday morning. His regret and attempt to try gaining my trust back only lasted until Sunday. These two days he spent apologizing and telling me how he wanted to grow old with me, that kind of stuff. Well, like all this didnt seem bad enough, the worst part of the story comes now. On Monday morning, I was at the gym, and I got a message from him. The way he wrote seemed odd, so I asked if something was wrong and he said he didnt feel good. I immediately left the gym and told him to give me a few minutes, that I would get home and we could call. As soon as I got home, I didnt even shower or anything, I just went to my room and called him. Then he just finished shattering my heart. He said he needed to be honest with me. He said that from the very first time we met in person, when I went there, he felt something wasnt right between us. That he didnt feel a connection. He said kissing and other intimate moments felt weird. He said he only proceeded with everything, asked me to marry him, started my Visa process and everything because he was scared of being alone. Since he never had another relationship before and I was the first one that ever got interested in him, he felt like he had to do everything he could to keep me in his life, so he wouldnt end up alone. Now that he had found this other girl, he felt he really connected with someone.",

Therefore, my grandparents had gain custody of me. For the most part, my early childhood was normal until around a certain age I was molested by an older female family member that had also extended to one of my female neighbour doing the same thing. At the time, I did not understand this or knew anything, but they as did. This didnt impact me at first, I was too young to understand, but as I got older I was lashing out a lot more, mainly to the female gender. At first, I didnt realize this, and Ive never told anyone what happened either. I felt ashamed, scared I get in trouble and no one would believe me. ampx200B As years went on, I grew to be more of an oddball person, an outcast among my peers. I did not get along with the female gender, and I didnt care until I hit puberty. Around this time, Im still super awkward and bully by everyone. I didnt have many friends, maybe 23 and this stayed until high school. Up until this point, never had a girlfriend and didnt know how to approach any girl for it. My selfconfidence is long shot with abandonment issues. Most of my family thinks Im gay and Im still bullied. ampx200B Additionally, to all of this, I have developed depression. As a teenager, I look around and see people hooking up but not this guy. At home, I had several relatives just killing my confidence, saying I was gay saying I would never amount to anything and so on. I also have , and my family stopped getting medication for it.

Ive been bottling it all in and Im just so tired. Ive noticed signs of depression through an increase in sensitivity, time spent crying which went from nothing to suddenly tearing up at night.. Ive noticed myself being unable to clean my room or find energy to go work out, and I either sleep too long and feel guilty or spend all night awake exhausted but unable to sleep. Im so tired. I cant do anything, I cant even hang around my friends because it feels like they hate me or Im not good enough. I either try to starve myself to feel the pain of hunger or overeat to get rid of the pain. I have no one to talk to. I feel guilty and Im not diagnosed so Im wondering if Im just faking it, but Im too scared to bring it up to my doctor because last time she brushed it aside. I cant talk to my parents because one is mad at me and the other thinks Im dramatic. I dont know what I want, if anything can someone just please tell me itll be ok?",
    "I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to keep going My spouses mental health is so much worse than mine so Im the one who always has to be strong and supportive, but Im losing it. Im losing my grip on things. I dont have anyone to go to. I dont really have many friends because my depression worsened after college and I lost touch with almost everyone I was close to. Im going to crack. Im afraid. Im so fucking afraid.",
    "The current situation has caused a HUGE setback Hey everyone. I hope you are doing better during this crazy time than I am. A bit of background Im a California girl in my 50s. And, Ive struggled for 20 years to fight off very intense anxiety and depression. I have been unable to work since 2014. Ive got a claim for SSDI, but apparently Im not sick enough. SMH I married my high school sweetheart May of 2018. He was the one that got away. I was never happier. After choosing the wrong guys all my life, I finally choose the right guy! Then in October he fell ill with an unknown lung disease. By the 21st of December I lost my love, my best friend he just couldnt breathe anymore. He put up a valiant fight. I was immediately hospitalized in the psych unit. I was overwhelmed with grief. I wanted to die. I wanted to be with him. I even tried several times to make that happen. And to add fuel too the fire, my dad passed away three months after my husband. Im not ashamed to say I was Daddys Little Girl. And I miss him just as much as my husband. So, for a whole year I struggled and fight my depression and anxiety. In that year, I was hospitalized 10 times, for psych and other ailments I have. But sometime after the 1 year mark when he died, I kinda just came out of the fog. I was feeling so much better, reaching out to his mom and other friends. I was so glad that I was gonna beat this. Fast forward to the present. I am an isolater by nature, so this covid19 situation I know I can get through it. I have one good friend and my motherinlaw for support. I keep my appointments with my psychiatrist, and take my meds as prescribed. I have no income, since I have to go through the entire process with Social Security before I can qualify to receive spousal benefits. Basically, what he was earning. Thank the good Lord for food stamps and Food Share, Ill never go hungry.",
    "What do you do when life seems pointless and everything feels out of reach? I 24F have suffered from bad depression in the past year, it seemed to get better with meds and time, but now I feel like its resurfacing. I feel like crying everyday, I dont have the motivation to do anything productive, I dont feel like seeing people or going out of the house and I dont feel like eating. I do those things occasionally but I just dont enjoy any of it like I used to, I feel like Im tied down with indecisiveness about my future, and I feel like nothing I do will ever amount to anything or be enough to make me happy or feel worhty My question is, what do I do to help me get through this period?",
    "I want to know why I shouldn't die Every day is torture, I am constantly ridiculed with thoughts of worthlessness and suicide. I feel like all I do injure people, waste time and money, and only am a hindrance to those around me. I have no support, have no one to talk to, have no social skills or friends, no skills. I am so lonely. I have no one to blame but myself. And yet I am constantly told to not kill myself, that things will get better, and the human body is surprisingly resilient when it comes to dying. Everyone wants me to live, but it truly does not matter if I do. It hurts so much. I see no reason to not end my life.",
    "Been feeling extra lost lately. I wonder if its just the negative vibes in the air surrounding all this Covid business and other negative news like peoples mental health declining, more suicides or destruction due to climate change. Im starting to feel that my whole lifes been dictated for me from the beginning. I never had much control. Now that Im a certain age, im expected to function normally but somehow I cant find anything to motivate me. I cant find anything that interests me and drives me to do better. The feeling sucks. Its almost like this is how older people driven to suicide must feel. A burden on people they know, aimless. Nothing left to live for. Feels like no one will notice if Im gone. Ive never done anything worthwhile or contributed to anything anyway.",
    "I feel like I have to kill myself, it's inevitable I think that there isnt any other option, and that in the end it will always come to this anyways. Like no matter what I do, I need to die. Ive always felt like dying is my only option whether I like it or not, and theres really no reason for me to be here anyways. Ive been in therapy and different treatments for so long, and it just always comes back to me wanting to stop existing. There have been days where I think it could get better, but that stops pretty quickly. Ever since middle school Ive been thinking about ending it. Its only until recently that Ive made a true plan and stuff. I feel like a complete asshole because I have a great life, my parents love me, yada yada, and yet I still feel this way. Im still so tired and lonely and I feel like a complete fuckup. Honestly, its not even that I want to commit suicide, I just dont want to exist anymore. Its just that suicide seems like the only way of accomplishing that? I dont know if this even makes any sense.",
    "Sometimes the worst part isn't what happened to us but being alone with the pain from what happened to us I spent some money on something helpful for my mom that she very much uses and loves because Im grateful for her help which was what she was talking about and after getting angry at her but expressing it in an unhealthy way I feel like shit. It doesnt feel the same trying to vent online, because I want my female friends that I know and care about and feel a genuine connection with to make me feel heard and listened to, and always starting from zero talking to strangers and trying to provide context about who I am and the dexterity of my mental illness is exhausting. Im a very supportive and helpful person to my said friends when it comes to mental health problems, and having to be on the receiving end and in need of help at inconvenient times just sucks. In the past Ive posted to reddit and people will look at my post history saying you are a very mentally ill person and should get help. And I wish I could just say that most of us mentally ill people dont have to luxury to afford anything that actually can help. And well have to take what little opportunities we can get even if its not ideal or in the least helpful. Lonely people dont have the luxury to choose who can comfort them. I still feel the lump in my throat and ache in my chest from a crisis and breakdown but at least Ive expressed myself",

What medications worked short term and what would you steer clear from. I dont use illicit drugs, including marijuana or their derivatives.

    "Burned out and trying to come back from it First time posting here. Looking for incite on things. Backstory Im in a weird place in my life right now. I just turned 30, and there have been events in my life that I want to get over. I could itemize the events but its more about my feelings about them that I want to move on from. I was a social work student but I dropped out because it was emotionally draining. And across a lot of different areas of my life I need to cope with things. I feel defeated and ashamed of myself. I feel like I dream too big and cant attain those dreams. I feel pain from society and how people treat me and each other. Im sick and tired of the hate we all do to each other. We are all in pain for different reasons in life. I feel like its pain for seeing how the world is and wishing that these conversations would start to get visibly better. I scroll Reddit because of how amazingfunnybeautiful things can be. I think Im too weighed down from seeing so much pain. I got divorced a year ago and all of my friends and I lost touch. My ex was a good person most of the time but he did some pretty abusive stuff too. And so Im dealing with grief of people no longer being in my life that I liked having around but that I had to say goodbye to in a way so that my life could try to get better. I want the grief to heal. I want my self worth to heal back. Im tired emotionally and I know Ill get back on my feet. Theres so many reasons to feel sad about anything or everything. But what do you do next once you know that? Knowing theres endless reasons for things to be bad or to be good. I feel drained like its some sort of mental gravity not sure how to describe it but almost like Ive been working myself too hard. Things will get better but I need to figure out how to heal myself inside.",
    "My mom told me she hated me, asked me to never contact her again and called me a “low life b$;!?” I would never use such words to my children. I don’t understand how a parent couldn’t love and support who she birthed? Hurt.💔😞 Relationship with mom was never great as a child, but I always made excuses for her. She really never held the responsibility of my raising it was always amongst someone else. I dont feel like I was ever raised I think I was only ever baby sat. I dont understand why my family never gave me away to someone who would have loved me? I was always moved from place to place as a child within different family members. Just long enough for a person to get tired of me and then moved to the next house until I was forced to take care of myself at 16 years old and nobody has cared for me since. It hurts living in the world and needing advice and support but having no one to turn to because all you remember is only ever having yourself. I remember living with family members and only having two outfits and at a young age I was forced to wash my own clothing because no one would do it for me. I have no choice but to think back at these times when looking for advice and support because I never have had anyone. My mom thought she was doing a deed to keep me away from my father as a child now Ive grown up to have no one. I resent her for it. But Im ready to move on how do I let all of this pain go so I can be happy in life? Its easier said than done been trying to do it for years. All advice helps",
    "Wife wants space to fight depression I have made the conscious decision to fight with every strand of my being to save this marriage and I will not be the one that ends it. Things have been fairly positive, we have met up at least once a week for walkscoming over for dinner etc etc. But its all very friendly, but I do say that I love her every now and then. She wants to take things one step at a time and she is open to marriage counselling, if the mental health counselling doesnt work out. I think deep down she still loves me even though she doesnt say it or that she misses me but does slip in the odd soppy nickname here and there. Might be just a habit, I dont know. She still clearly cares about me because the other day she barged into the house after my phone wasnt receiving sending calls or texts and I didnt let her know I was safe at home. She also does other things like picks things off me like the odd scab and blackhead here and there, cut my hair and hugs me in a meaningful manner. I feel like I may be rambling a bit here, I want to feel positive about things but I am really struggling. I am putting a brave face on for her so she has less pressure, but anytime we part ways I sob uncontrollably for hours because i just love her so much and want her to come home. Has anyone else gone through something similar with their spouse? Any tips? Ive been extremely self critical and I can see there are improvements I can make to make the relationship better. Especially now we have more financial freedom. But with lockdown still in force, it makes things 10x more difficult. TLDR My wife wants space to find out what she wants. She says Ive done nothing wrong. We still talk and meet up. Marriage counselling after her individual counselling. Im hurting and want neutral advice.",
    "My adult daughter makes me depressed We brought our adult 19yr old daughter up in a loving good home gave her everything. Since been a teenager all her morals have changed she swears is disrespectful tells her friends lies that we are awful parents she scams family and friends for money so she doesnt have to get a job. She rarely calls only if she wants something. She never even contacts he brother or sister. She is addicted to her phone.

    "Just confused One of my closest friends recently sat me down to commit to improving my depression, which I get. Things were okay. 4 days later he told me we talk too much, but everything is okay. When I asked why the sudden shift in communication. Often my friend would be the one to initiate the conversation, call me first or text me first. It was mutual. We both texted random crap throughout the day. As I dont believe I lost a friend, how do I proceed? Do I give space for a few days and see how things play out? Do I say sorry? Its bugging me of how to fix things.",
    "Help finding therapist Hi everyone. First time posting here and looking to see if anyone has any advice. This is not a throw away because I dont care what people think about me. I suffer from highly functional depression. I have been seeing a psychiatrist and am currently on medication, which helps, but still have bad days. I have seen a psychologist in the past, middle aged male, that I couldnt open up to. After seeing him for 2 years I stopped going because of work change. My spouse, primary care, and psychiatrist all urge me to find someone to talk to. I thought long and hard and realized the personality of someone that I could open up to. With all this being said, is there a good way to search for local therapists online in your area? I tried a few months back and could only find older individuals. I need someone closer to my age 36 as I feel it would allow me to open up more. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.",

I have been contemplating suicide and jave been looking forward to today in hopes that something would change. But nothing did. And if on mt special day nothing changes, then will anything ever really change? I decided no, and I made my final decision on whether or not i should follow through with whats been on my mind. And i decided I will. There is no point, Im not happy and im always alone. This is my goodbye. I am posting this in the hopes that maybe someone will care. In the hopes that maybe someone will try to stop me, but I dont think thats what will happen. No body seems to really care about me these days. Im just another guy on the street to everyone.

    "Struggling So I have always struggled with depression but after I had met my husband 8 years ago I started doing really well and for the most part didnt have depression. We were always doing stuff to keep busy and keep my mind off the stuff that would bring me down. Well fast forward to now and I am just feeling at the end of my rope. My health took a 180 about two years ago and I now struggle with quite a few health problems that keep me from doing the things I use to do. I cant even do simple things that a lot of people take for granted. And now I see what toll it is taking on my husband to have to take care of me so much and it kills me. He has become so short and angry at the world and has made comments that make me feel like I am to cause for all this. I am sure that is not how he feels just how it makes me feel I just wish I could make all the pain and hurt go away. I feel myself slipping further and further away and I dont know how to cope anymore. Just wish I could quit feeling like this all the time. Any Advice would be greatly appreciated.",

    "My girlfriend has depression and I don’t know how to be there for her Weve only been dating 5 months but we lived together for 4 because of the pandemic. Recently I came back to live in my house and discussed that we would see each other a few times a week. She changed a lot after I left, she went to see a lot of friends and only saw her once. She started therapy sessions and told me she feels really unhappy. As someone who struggled with depression myself I understand which is why Im so conflicted. I want to be there for her but I dont know if she wants me to. I dont want to smother her but I want her to know she has my full support and Im here for her for anything she needs. I was debating whether to ask her if she wants me to come live with her again but she was the one that suggested to stay in our own places again because it would be better for our relationship. Im just terrified of her breaking up with me because she wants to sort herself out. It would break me. Should I ask her if she wants me to go back? Should I take initiative with things or let her tell me when and what she wants? I just want her to feel loved and supported but I also know shes very independent and doesnt like asking for things.",

    "I don’t know why I’m seeking help here but please just read as much as you can... So Im 15 and for most of my life Ive been treated not badly but like Im really different as if there were something wrong with me pretty much only in school since kindergarten. Other than that Ive always been a happy kid with a great sense of humour but in the last few years since becoming a teen things have crashed down on me. I believe it was 2015 my close nan my mums side, ill get to why thats important later was diagnosed with dementia other nan lives on a farm outside my town where she barely sees anybody. In 2017 my cat that I had only had for about 5 years when he came to my doorstep seemingly only a few weeksmonths old suddenly died from chest cancer and I felt sad mainly because I didnt have much to do with him even though I loved him so much. Although I have had a few pet losses this hurt me for a few months tear down my face as Im writing this. The main reason it was so bad was how a normal day turned into hearing he was unable to move when my Aunty went home for a break, and that later turned into the vet saying he should be put down. On to the next crack in my life. Only a few weeks before I was born my dad died I still dont have it in me to sit with my mum and have that conversation on how it happened, and although I dont feel sad about not having him as Im used to it since birth, I have heard things about fatherless kids not having as good lives although I am being co raised by my Aunty who is pretty much a 2nd mother except she can be giving the fatherly tough love some times. There has also been drama including my other Aunty doing drugs and making our life harder I will say I dont think it is intentional but her stupid choices are messing us all up. Theres heaps more I can talk about like my addiction to games even when Im not enjoying them and the recent passing of artist xxxtentacion I know hes a very controversial person but I really enjoyed his music and just seeing his face and hearing his messages to his fans.",

I started to play video games because as a child I was never allowed any type of electronic and I was extremely curious. Because of how my family treated me I started playing more and more video games and it became the one thing that I actually felt motivated to do. I began lying to my parents about what I was doing and when my school gave me a MacBook with special programs in it because I have ADDI played video games on that. I became addicted and still am. My parent filmed me on a camera and now all my homework must be done in front of a camera. I am just sick of how everything in my life is falling apart. My parents made a contract for me to sign about the rules of the house. I signed it. There are special things like, finish all homework get 30 mins of screen time. There are also stupid rules like at lunch no tv, only homework. My parents want me to do exercise but I am already 6ft1 and 150 pounds. They scream at me when I want to use my 30 mins of screen time after I have done my homework. On weekends I sleep for 14 hours and I just feel like I am in a constant cycle of screaming and pain.

    "How to get through depression as a young adult ? Hello... Im new to reddit, and joined this sub because Ive been dealing with depression since the beginning of my teenage years and wanted to ask you guys and especially those who found a way out of depression how did you manage to get through it ? Im only 18, ik im still young and all but I feel so empty and worthless, crying and thinking about killing myself everyday. I dont have any objective to focus on in my life that could help me cheer up and fight for. Of course I spoke with therapists but didnt keep up with the sessions because everytime I talk about my problems and my past I start crying and panicking, which makes me think even more that Im helpless and makes me hate those sessions... Also, I find them useless for therapists say things that are really obvious, like if you want to have friends and go out with them, just ask people of your class to hang with you, well thanks, but the real issue is that I cant find the motivation and courage to talk to people since I always fear to be rejected. Thats for this type of answer I put an end on the sessions. My parents know that theres something off about me but Ive always done my best in hiding how bad I feel because ik they wouldnt understand, since all they do is making jokes about my sad facial expression when I eat with them... And I have literally 0 friends IRL who I could talk to about that, only online buddies that try to cheer me up sometimes, but I can tell that they get tired of it and I cant blame them for it, ik it is hard to try helping someone but things just remain the same. I really want to get out of this situation... Thank you for reading, and sorry for the grammar mistakes, Im french .",
    "Texas ice storm - feeling guilty &amp; overwhelmed I live in Texas, and my community is in need of a lot of help. I was out of town for the worst of it, and was lucky enough to come home to all of utilities still on, no damage to the house, nothing. I even had a good amount of food in the pantry. I housed a few friends, and donated to some organizations, but still feels like Im not doing enough. Specifically Ive been invited to volunteer this weekend alongside other people from my industry. However, yesterday I wanted to get my house in order first, but ended up lying in bed, and eventually falling asleep for a few hours, because it all just seemed so overwhelming. Cue guilt for neither volunteering nor getting anything done around the house. Today Im in the same boat. I apologized and told the volunteer crew Id definitely be coming today, but again the house is still a mess, and I need to get it back in shape before I go back to working full time tomorrow. Funny thing is that I could totally do both, but my depressionanxiety tells me I just need to hide in bed all day instead. Frustrating, because four months ago I started taking medication been in therapy for longer and its been incredibly helpful, but it cant seem to take the edge off during this time of crisis....even though Ive hardly been affected personally. Im spiraling because I feel such a duty to help others, but I know I need to help myself first...and seems that I can do neither right now. Any helpadvicesupport would be appreciated!",
    "The Story of This Year Im a 22yo male and Ive been struggling with depression and anxiety since before I can even remember. I was put into the foster care system in Australia when I was 3 and stayed there till I was 18. Thankfully I didnt cycle a lot like most kids and I found a foster family who I now call my real family. Im having a really difficult time at the moment, this year had been really really tough. Im in my 4th year of uni and Ive failed the last 2 years because of my mental state, Ive been seeing counsellors and doctors and Im on medication. 2 weeks ago I got diagnosed with Bipolar II and now been medicated for that. But I just need to vent so Im going to talk about my year and hows its been the worst and best year Ive had in a very long time. So the best year started on the 31st of December 2018. I was at college by myself over Christmas and in news years eve I wanted to spend it with someone because I couldnt with my foster family. I invited 2 friends that were in my town at the time who came over. We sat and chatted for an hour and they started to get bored, my mate asked if he could invite a friend over to join us, I agreed. This friend ended up bringing a fair few people, I would say around 10. Me being anxious as all shit over everything in life, freaked out and stayed silent. I ended up having a few drinks and with each one became more confident and less anxious. Turns out these people were pretty amazing, I made a friend who was 7ft tall and he was honestly the big friendly giant. I made another friend who Ill call Max, we hit it off straight away and Ive never connected so well with someone. We instantly became best friends, he stayed over my place for an entire month until we decided to move out with 2 of our other friends, one of those who was homeless and was desperately trying to find someone to live. A little back story before we get rocky, I lived at a university where at the time our flat 8 bedroom house sorta thing was located on campus. All 8 people were and still are my closest friends. They are a very important part of my life and they mean the world to me.",
    "People who don't have school/work: what do you do? For the people out there who arent in school and dont work, what do you do with your time? And I know it sounds like Im being rude, but I really want to know. Long story short, Ive been in college for a few years with worsening depression. Its likely that Im going to take a leave of absence because its become painfully clear to me that I cant handle school. I dont want to leave school, but I made exactly zero progress towards my degree this semester and its a massive waste of money to stay in school at my current mental state. Im in the middle of trying a new antidepressant my sixth in about three years and my current plan is to move home for the upcoming semester so that I have time to figure out treatment because trying a new antidepressant takes like three months and if this medication isnt the one, then thats another quarter of the year down the drain. But Ive been trying to figure out what Ill do with all my time and... I find myself drawing a blank. Sure, Ill be trying medications and going to therapy, but thatll take a couple hours per week at the absolute maximum. I can try to exercise, but again, thats maybe an hour out of my day if I can find the energy to do it. The rest of the time, I have absolutely no idea what to do other than watch Netflix and YouTube and go on Reddit, all things which I know are bad for my mental health and make me feel even more like I have no sense of purpose. I dont think I can handle getting a job maybe on a parttime basis, but Im not sure if I can deal with even that. My family has dogs, so Ill take care of them, but still, I anticipate having hours and hours of time in which I have to entertain myself alone. tldr Im going to leave school temporarily, but I dont know what Ill do with all my time other than mindlessly browse the Internet. For those of you who dont go to school or work, what do you do with your day? What gives you a sense of structure and purpose?",
    "Dating someone with depression - help Hi, This is a throwaway account. I need some help andor advice. About a half a year ago I 32F started dating someone M42 absolutely amazing. We share interest, same humor, honesty have been there since the beginning, we can talk about anything, even shared deeply vulnerable stories and the sex is amazing as well. We seem to be able to connect in a way Ive never tried before and create this space where it is just us. Green flags all the way. I quickly fell madly in love with him ofcourse. I shared my feelings for him about 4 months into it, told him no pressure at all since I wasnt ready for a full blown serious relationship and he didnt either. I have no doubt that he has feelings for me. Non. About 2 months ago he fell deep down into depression. He told me. I told him if there was anything I could do to help? He said maybe. I told him I was there if he needed to talk. He said thank you. Asked him if he wanted to meet up again soon? He said he was feeling so bad and was overwhelmed at work he works a lot. I said no problem, you just write me when the time is better, no pressure and Im not mad. Take your time. He said he would. Its been a month since that last text, and I havent heard anything. My guts tell me to just wait, but I am worried and a little unsure of how to handle this situation.. Should I keep on waiting I am not in a hurry and if Im not going to continue my relationship with him I dont feel like dating at all right now or should I reach out? afraid of preassuring. Abandoning him is not an option. Please give me some advice or share if you have a similare story. I would love to hear from someone who has depression and who is dating someone who hasnt.",
    "I haven’t been myself since 2020. Will I ever go back to normal or should I just give up on life? I was a straight A college student and part time EMT. Now Im an unemployed college dropout living at my parents house. I gained 40 pounds and stopped enjoying my usual activities. I feel like I go from doctor to doctor and none of them give a shit about any of this. The depression started very suddenly in January of 2021 and its gotten progressively worse ever since then. Things completely spiraled out of control in October because thats when I distanced myself from all of my friends. Ive been on 20mg lexapro for several years and I just switched to trintellix a month ago. But Trintellix makes me feel awful. If anything, Im worse off than I was before. I have slight brain fog constantly. I have emotions again, which is good, but theyre all negative. Im just sad and angry 247. I went to the doctor again today because they said I had minor hypothyroidism the last few times I got blood work done. Hopefully Ill get medicated for that. I just feel powerless. Im like a victim of my own mind. Before this very sudden bout of depression, I was so happy and excited about life. Now its as if I have no future because I cant control my depression and no one is helping me to do so. I havent been myself since 2020. I dont know what to do. Side note I started taking adderall in January and thats when I started getting depressed. Any correlation?",

    "i want it all to end Last year i got done with my senior highschool year and despite working soo hard for since june till the next june, studying hours daily i ended up falling short of the percentage i needed to enter the major i wanted to which is computer science and let myself and my family down. I had to major in finances since it was my only choice and i am hating it. Moreover i am hating the fact that i am living with myself as a failure, i never achieve anygoals that i want and i never get anywhere. I have OCD which i am taking medication and therapy for and it has been kicking in so hard lately with all the negativity making me go crazy. I am always depressed and my family is disappointed from me. I just feel like a burden now on every body around me i always have breakdowns and my family always blasts me for it. All my relatives are engineers and other good majors and jobs and i am stuck in this. i am sorry if my writing isnt organized but i am so disoriented right now. I feel like if i just die i would relief every body around me from my burden and relief them from the shame of having me. I cant stand living with my self knowing that i an a complete and utter failure. I dont deserve anything. I will never get anywhere in life i just want it all to end. i just want to die i cant live with myself anymore. And it is a relief knowing that when i die no one will care as i dont want to hurt anyone. I have no friends, my family wish they didnt have me. My relatives didnt even care to call or visit me when i was hospitalized after a cycling accident. I just wish to die and be forgotten instead of living in misery and burdening my family. I dont want to kill my self because i am a bit religious and suicide is prohibited in my religion but i wish i could. I just want to die i cant live anymore. I hate my self. I hate seeing my self in the mirror every morning. I hatr waking up and knowing i am still alive. i cry my self to sleep every might wishing i never wakeup again but i still do.",
    "Husband prioritize more Video Games I have an underlying condition like asthma and heart problem thats way we I opt to work from home and also my husband took a leave from him work to be safe from this virus. But recently he had this hobby and went back to video gaming and streaming through twitch. He is so into it and focus that he always wants things to be done quickly or fast like eating, resting, watching,cooking, movie or talking with me. Im being supportive with him. I even volunteer to make the twitch banner and logo for his twitch channel. But he said when I tried to talk to him and discuss about priorities just like now, Im not feeling well and I having extreme tummy aches and sore throat He said Im always criticizing and negative on him. He said I dont support him and I always go negative. I was hoping this quarantine is also a time for us to bond and get more time together but he always wants to play and stream. I felt like its okay to play and stream once in a while but not to the point you spent almost 8hours or more streaming and neglecting important things. Am I wrong in this? I just feel so unimportant and always second priority. I guess all I have is myself at the end of the day. Whatever I say or do, I always get the blame and Im the one wrong  Im so tired and broken.",

So far I have only had good experiences with advices on reddit, so I decided to post my problem here. Everything written below should try to make my current situation a little more understandable and not to arouse pity or something like that. Thanks  ampx200B ampx200B Hi, Im almost 18 years old, and Im trying to briefly summarize my life as fast as possible. ampx200B Ive been bullied at school since I was around 9 years old fourth grade. It got a little less in eighth grade, but most of the people at school still left me out. had about 2 relatively good friends. At the same time about 1415 years old I started drinking. I came to school drunk about 23 times a week and drank now and then on weekends. Mostly I drank alone. I hated going to school because of the other students and tried to make my time there a little nicer. At the same time I got to know a very good friend to whom I could open up for the first time because she also had to struggle with bullying and depression. However, I fell deeply in love with her but never told her and always pretended I just wanted to be friends with her because she was my only good friend and I didnt want to lose her. I became emotionally dependent on her. After a little over 2 years she began to feel that I felt for her she had a boyfriend at the time. We fell out and she cut off contact with me. I was devastated for months, unable to concentrate on work and just plain desperate. It was two years ago and I still have to think about her quite a lot. ampx200B In the period between 14 years old eighth grade and now almost 18 a lot more things happened.",

    "I'm a fat useless slob and not god damn thing fucking works. Long time friend from college is manic, unstable, and abrasive. Trying to address issues from a long time ago when my father was an emotionally abusive duchebag, mother was sheltered and never worked or had to do a god damn thing herself till her 50s. My brother was physically abusive cunt. Both Bro and Father were almost always drunk, or high as fuck on pot. In my youth We had I think it was 3 TVs. 2 for the family, 1 bro got from somehow probably dumpster diving. My father would use all 3 for his precous fucking sports shit. Hed have a completetantrum if he missed a play or some super important second of a fucking god damn play. Mother and him would have fights. SHed always leave notes threating to leave. I think I tried to uncously devise ways to not be home much because of that shit. Grandpa was just an asshole. I loved him, dont me wrong, but the motherfucker was a distant asshole. His wife spent most of her time shitfaced. I dont know how we managed to keep it together for enjoyable dinners that were legit great. Bro would come home drunk and start beating or kicking me to get the fag out of you and make you a man. HIs fucked up girfriends got off on that. I tried to stay in my room because my parents were to fucking pussy to say anything to him . THey called it No Karate in the kitchen looking back thats not cute. I was bullied to tears, had my fucking shit stolen on the regular from jealous cunts from a ghetto. I hated everything about jr high....wait loved the nice girls i met. Brought home one of my girlfriends. A super soft, gentle, kind nice,, just mmmmm yummy girl I met in some class IIRC. Think name was jen.

    "My depression has been so bad, no one has tried to contact me for months to check up and it tears me apart Everytime Ive felt that my relationship with a person is stable and we connect and have known eachother for years, I get proven wrong. I now naturally feel intense instibility in friendships, or seeking out friendships in general, because I now expect people to already have a circle of close friends, and I cant be apart of that. And it keeps happening, even online mutual friends have not reached out to me despite seeing my personal posts and how much of a hard time Ive been having this year. Even me disappearing for months did nothing. I feel intensely stupid and selfish, while at the same time feeling like if I had killed myself during these months of such bad depression, life would resume and no one would know. I feel stupid and selfish because I absolutely know its not peoples responsibility to worry about me, especially when they are living their lives and are probably going through their own issues, and I shouldnt be throwing my frustration and bitterness on people. But it feels Ive been just left in the dark while online mutuals who have known me for years, continue to enjoy their interactions with eachother and pretend nothing is happening unless they want to engage in a post thats not a personal one. Theres a lot of different issues in my life which have contributed to my diagnosis of depression and anxiety, but this year it feels like God wants to keep telling me no one cares for you. Til this day I dont know how people make lifelong friendships with people you have so much history and connection with. Maybe because of my own insecurities and outlook on friendships, Im simply expecting something that normally isnt how it works. I just feel so suffocated whenever Im online, its like I want to scream at everyone and say LOOK AT ME PLEASE, IM SUFFERING RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU, I THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS and for never paying attention when I suffered so much and continue to suffer, but want to interact with me on posts that are not about my personal mental health. What happened to making sure everyones okay? Do I not matter enough? Are they just sick and tired of me now? I cant even reach out in this kind of situation because again, I shouldnt be demanding people think about me.",
    "Complete recovery after depression is a realistic expectation? I also got fired right before Christmas for sleeping too much at work and doing almost nothing because of my depression, but I wasnt even mad about it. I mean, I cried because crying was like my main occupation along with sleeping and because I knew thats what Im supposed to do when I get fired but I didnt really feel much about that event. In January I went in a trip to New York with one of my best friends and I enjoyed every moment of it! Then I came home and started looking for a new job. I was so relaxed and carefree and I was becoming my old self again. In February I started a new job and shortly after that I stopped my antidepressants treatment. But I feel like this journey of becoming my old self again is never going to be complete. Sometimes I get close to what I used to be before this whole thing but I cant sustain that, like the oldhappyme is visiting sometimes but she doesnt wanna stay. Even though things go great for me now great new job, great old friends, new healthy romantic relationship I am mostly anxious and scared. I cant be genuinely happy with the good things I have in my life, because the fear of losing them and going straight back into depression is overwhelming. I heard things like youll never go back to what you used to be before depression, depression leaves a scar youll have to live with your entire life, depression is a part of growing up, you just cant go back. I am starting to believe these things and its sad. Are they true? I have no chance to going back to my old self?",

    "depression ruining my relationship and ability to enjoy things unless im distracted or drunk Ive always been depressed. Im 26 now and Ive been dating the same girl for 4 years. Sometimes I love her, i want to marry her, life together, etc. Other times I imagine myself being happier with someone else. Maybe someone more attractive or with more things in common note my gf already quite attractive and we share interests, not necessarily perfectly my type but nobody is. But Ive had this with other things. Im incapable of Happiness unless I am EXTREMELY distracted, or drunk. or both. when im not distracted, i think about everything. maybe ill never be happy. maybe ill never be skilled enough in my interests and hobbies to satisfy me. I play competitive games and always want to be on top but its never good enough. when i am working i want to learn everything i can to be successful but it is ever enough. when im with my gf and start thinking about the perfect woman, she is not it. but i mean, nobody is. my ideal perfect woman changes all the fucking time, and im not dating a super model anytime soon and even if i was i still would probably find something to criticize about her. There is something wrong with the way I think. i think? but idk what to do. Im always overly critical of EVERYTHING. my appearance is never good enough, my work is never good enough, my foreign language skills are never good enough, my gf is never good enough, my rock climbing skills are never good enough, my home is never good enough, my voice is never good enough. EVERYTHING is flawed and I hate everything...except for when i am extremely distracted and something has 100 of my attention, or Im drunk and have to focus 100 of something to even function. wtf do i do? i love my gf, but i dragging her down. i dont want to curse her with a life of babysitting my emotions, but when she wants to break up with me for being a downer i get even more depressed and beg her to stay because im confident she is the one in that moment.",

Weve also been rental searching but theres just nothing in our price range and those that ARE dont want an unemployed family.

I swear I dont want to sit on benefits and drain resources, I just want some help getting a job that wont put me in a hospital or the ground due to my condition and maybe some help getting a place so Im not boxed in.

    "Randomly breaking down I randomly break down and cry without warning. Previously, it didnt happen often and when it does, I was would be able to control it for a bit till I find myself hidden from peoples eye. I.e toilet, server room etc Recently, its like I control it anymore. The only thing i am able to do, is cover my face with my palms when that happens. I am m27 and Im a working professional. Like I wear formal to work on a daily basis. I really dont want people to see me breaking down. Do anyone experience similar? How do you hope with it ?",
    "Any Support Group/Chat besides Wumpus? Hello All. I tried to join the Wumpus Discord group but the main lobby seemed hectic and was just random people saying random things. I am new to Discord  is the main lobby just generally not right place for support help? I tried looking through the other rooms therapy 13, advice 12, etc. and it also didnt seem to be really on topic. I tried to do the 11 support and there was someone who answered but after I shared, I no longer got a response not sure if they got busy, missed my message, or something else. This is my first time reaching out for some kind of support and Im feeling discouraged and stupid. Are there other groups or people or something out there? Late twenties F  any relevant groups? Please and thank you.",
    "My life is amazing, but I'm a miserable asshole. I'm not sure what to do. So Ive hit a wall, and I dont really have any support in my life, so I decided to turn to you guys. Kinda weird for this to be my first post, but whatever. And sorry in advance, this is probably going to be a long rant. Like the title says, I live a really great life. Im married to a beautiful woman who loves me more than anything, the sex is amazing, and shes smart and talented and has a great, lucrative job. I just graduated college 12 years later than I had planned, but doesnt matter in a field that Im really passionate about, with plans to apply for grad school. Financially, I dont live in luxury, but Im comfortable. I have an amazing dog. I have a good, supportive family. I live in a safe neighborhood. Im not trying to brag, but just trying to illustrate how from the outside, I really dont have anything to complain about. Im aware of how incredibly lucky I am. But the problem is, Im just miserable all the time, no matter what I do. For a little background, Ive been in therapy for over two decades Im currently 34. For most of that, I was misdiagnosed with clinical depression, bipolar disorder, several anxiety disorders, and given cocktail after cocktail. Two years ago, it turns out it was a misdiagnosis and it was atypical ADD no hyperactivity, just the concentration and motivation issues, and Ive been properly medicated since. Ive had ECT electroshock twice, before the ADD diagnosis. My current therapist is excellent, and tells me that compared to how I was when I first started seeing her almost 9 years ago Im so far beyond where I was that its astounding. I guess what Im saying is, Ive been lucky in that Ive been able to take advantage of mental health resources, and what Im experiencing isnt due to a lack of those. I have been in quite a few abusive relationships romantic and platonic so I know theres some trauma Im still working through.",
    "Dae have a therapist that does this? Shes registered and a doctor so Im inclined to give her the benefit of the doubt, but honestly shes not been helpful at all. I want an outside perspective so that I can know if its on me or her. She talks just like a distracted friend instead of a therapist. 13 word responses. For example, I told her I was frustrated and felt lost about something, and she just said understand. Her solutions are things I could come up with on my own and basically boil down to her just saying no every time I bring up a harmful coping mechanism. I already know whats wrong with me and my life but not how to fix it! And she believes that I should talk the most in therapy but I dont feel heard when all she does is....listen? If that makes sense? I dunno.... Ive just been spiralling into a worse and worse place mentally and depending on her and getting this seems to be hurting more than helping. But then I have no idea what therapy is supposed to be like. Is it supposed to be really hard before it gets any better?",
    "I'm 16 and I'm a mess I feel like Im a shadow of an older self, like my real me died and I am just his shed, slowly crumbling to pieces. My mind feels blank and oversaturated all at once. I feel like Im not even the main character of my life anymore, Im not even sure if I ever was, I feel like Im just a background character, I feel like Im stuck on froze and I cant move an inch. I see all those opportunities of potential happiness go away, slip of my hand, I feel like Im constantly waisting my time just by being alive, I feel like Im losing so much time, I feel like Im watching all the best moments of my life pass me by and I will never get them back. I feel like I cant do anything anymore. I feel like its out of my reach, like Ill never anyone of importance, like Ill never positively impact peoples life like I always dreamed of. You know, the internet is a shitty place, not in all of its aspects, but in a lot of them. When I started using social media outside YouTube, in this case Twitter, I was around 13. I exposed myself to a lot of shit. To a lot of poeple and events I wish I never knew existed, to a lot of disappointments, to a lot of toxicity... Do a lot of you wonder if youre just weak? The internet often gave me that impression. I think Im weak, I definitely do, but I dont know how much. I dont know if poeple are just agressive pretentious entitled assholes that think their opinions make them somehiw better than everyone or Im just being too sensitive and itd just the way poeple state their opinion, I dont know. When I was 13, I played so much vidya, sometimes from 8 am to 8 pm non stop. When I discovered that one of my favorite games was hugely hated on the internet, it made me feel miserable, like my taste was inferior, like I was so dumb to like that thing.",

The two reasons  I might publish a book  my mother would suffer too much. My dog died two weeks ago because of cancer. Now when I feel like shit I keep thinking about the fact that hes not here anymore and honestly I cant cope with the pain. I was about to adopt another dog but the dog shelter messed up.

    "Just at a point where I’m tired of feeling like this. Without pulling on heartstrings. Im 33F on my own. Depressed and on Prozac. Had CBT for 3 months and Ive worked so so hard on trying to focus on me. New job. A great job. Dream job. And its the perfect distraction. And then I finish and go home and just cry. Cry for the stuff I have experienced. And I grieve for the loss of personality and character from myself. Grieve for the fact I dont ever think I will fix myself or be able to have a life with someone and stuff. All because of mistreatment and bad situations leading up to this point in life. My heart hurts all the time. You know like the sinking gut heartache feeling when you receive bad news. I get that every minute Im awake. And I just cant fix it. Ive tried and tried. Im so lonely and so withdrawn. I just want it all gone. I have made 3 Suicide attempts since October 2020 and I keep telling myself that its not that bad Im 33. Im alone with everything. I cant even validate myself anymore. I try. I have an amazing job. A roof over my head. A good salary. But theres something missing and I just cannot shake it. I purchased some nice underwear at the weekend just to feel good about myself. I wore them and then cried because whats the point. I cant understand why or what I do moving forward other than ending it. Im just so lost",
    "Depressed International Student; need help I start working on something and feel it is totally pointless. I start watching youtube or the office to feel a bit better and suddenly it is 6 pm. I think that its already evening, maybe I should go out, get some fresh air. I go out, pickup a friend and smoke a cigarette or two my friend doesnt smoke. While coming back, I feel the day is almost over and I am basically useless, nothing will change if I get high. I go and buy some marijuana edible legal, eat it and go back home. I act like I am working while staying high, so my parents wont know. Many times, I just lie that I have a meeting and shut off my door, lie down and masturbate like twice or thrice in a day. As I get high, I also overeat and buy a lot of junk food and chocolates. Then, I spent the rest of the night till 23 am doing all this and watching office or Youtube. I feel totally exhausted and go to sleep. Then, I wake up next day exhausted at 10 and the cycle goes on. I also feel pretty dumb as I have almost no progress on my thesis. My professor thinks that I am smart but I am not. I just slack and slack and come up with some excuse for not doing the work. I just make some dumb and vague presentations an hour before the meeting. From last two weeks, I havent even done that. I just make some excuse and try to portray myself as the victim. I have one more semester left for my thesis and I think I should just quit. But I cant because then how will I pay for my loan. I am also not getting any internships, how the fuck am I supposed to get a job. I thought maybe Ill start a PhD degree as I am not really getting anything else and Ill at least get some stipend regularly if I get the scholarship. My chances of getting the scholarship are highly dependent on my honours thesis and I seem to be doing a very bad job till now. I have to submit a draft of a literature review on Monday rn its Saturday night which will be of around 15 pages and I havent even started yet.",
    "Everything fell apart after a failed business and a failed psyche. Figuring out next steps. 26m I had pretty moderate social anxiety through high school and college ultimately fueling depression. Went to get treatment before senior year of college, threw me on Zoloft and Klonopin. Helped a bit and was doing okay, graduated with great grades despite issues, information systems and marketing undergrad. Had a pleathora of random skills across the board mostly in the real of webdev and design, used to be passionate about photography but all passions have fallen off lately. Started a freelance drone services business out of undergrad despite not understanding just how much student debt I was in....in my name 60,000, in my parents name another ungodly amount...further fueling depression. Still living with parents in hope of hitting it big with the business. Things started off slowly so I went into an MBA program on the weekends while working on the business during the week. Psychiatrist put me on adhd meds too which helped. Graduated 2017 from that, business wasnt making any profit still, mainly breaking even didnt start off with any real capital so I was bootstrapping. Was still doped up on meds so I was still hopeful and disregarded the fact I wasnt making any real money. 2018 really nasty suicidal depression starts kicking in along with cognitive side effects and deteriorating memory. Business still breaking even, though halfway through the year almost landed a huge deal that wouldve put me way in the green. Came soooo close but then everything fell apart. Psychiatrist leaves the state halfway through the year and have to find a new one. New one takes me off klonopin too fast and takes away my adhd med and Im left like a deer in headlights for 6 months in a state of psychotic withdrawal unable to answer texts, emails or phone calls...couldnt even leave the house. Psych didnt care and made me suffer through it. Business fizzled out, wasnt making any money, trying to recover at home. 6 months later things started getting a little better, started tapering my way off Zoloft slowly. Got back on adhd med in 2019, went and got a low paying but close IT job in September.",
    "I hate my body and my thoughts Ever since I was little I was always struggling with my physical appearance. I have been told throughout my life that I was overweight and that just screwed over my image even more. Here I am feeling guilty cause I had a bit of grill chicken and honestly Im just tired. Im tired of thinking of exercise as a mere chore. Im tired that I cant enjoy food anymore, and the fact that my mom cooks so much doesnt help. My family all says Im lean and normal but I feel so disfigured. My shoulders are too broad and my arms are flappy making me look twice my size, my thighs are gigantic and are covered with cellulite. I really hate my mirrors and if I could break them I would. My weight is always in the middle of normal or overweight and one slice of cake could tip it off. Ive been active and even trying to just eat healthy foods but I still hate myself. I think my thoughts have screwed over and long for the underweight body. At this point I think normal looks fat.",
    "Exercising and sadness Hi im new here, last year i tried to end my life around this date and the support equip at the hospital told me to exercise regularly to help with the sadness, since i wasnt diagnosed depression or nothing really, just very sad. This is important becuse no one told me that before. And since then i tried to be more active, got a bike thanks to a job with my aunt and started walking for playing pokemon go again etc. But whenever i stop those activities i feel very low and sad, even if i do it just because im busy, but i have to admit sometimes i feel very lazy and tired to do them. Is there a connection between exercise and feeling happier? Can i find a way to be more excited about doing them alonewith friends? If this post needs another flair i can edit it",
    "I'm so lonely I wont give too much personal info away but Im a 24year old f who has recently moved with her girlfriend to the opposite end of the country. My girlfriend has got a fantastic, steady job and is always working long shifts nearly every day. I cant find a job anywhere and Ive just finished my 3rd year of law at university, so I have so much time alone. I downloaded Bumble the bff version to make friends but theyve slowly stopped talking when I dont message first I had tried to organise a friend meetup but it never went anywhere. I sometimes dont see anyone but my gf for weeks and its not for lack of trying. I do have friends but they all live in the city we moved from and have been really quiet. My supposed best friend has barely spoken to me in a few months. I just feel so lonely and desperate for friends. If I even had a job I could try making friends that way but its so, so difficult to get one. Theres no clubs or activities in this town other than the gym, and even then, with Covid, you have to understandably and rightly stay distant from everyone. Im not even sure what Im asking here other than just for one person to listen and care. My gf does but doesnt understand because she has a job.",
    "Helping a friend with depression Heyy there! I just found out that a very good online friend of mine suffers from depression and feeling down. Initally she just asked for advice regarding a crush of hers who already is in a relationship. When talking to her about it tho, she told me a few things that really got me worried. On the one hand, she feels understood by him. She feels like herself around him and like she doesnt have to fake her happiness. On the other hand, she admitted to sending him nudes, as he told her Id be okay to send some from time to time and it could even be there hot little secret Needless to say, Im really worried now. I gave her the advice to stay away from himstop contact with him and also came to an agreement, that her and I would look for a psychologist at the same time so niether of us feels like a crazy person needing psychiatric help lol Still, Ill continue to try and help her. I already thought about asking her how she feels although it is incredibly hard for her to open up about her feelings, but also motivating her to go out or try something new or something. Just fyi I never met her personally, she lives about two hours away. We do talk jokingly about meeting up some time soon tho, so maybe Ill see her soon. Do you have some more advice on how I could help her? Even if its just a small thing, any help is greatly appreciated!",

I am not in my right state of mind now, and understanding or coping with information s very poor. I would like to hear your opinion on this, thank you... Due to the Covid19 outbreak in europe, almost every country now closed borders, including mine. I understand this precautions and their nesessity but I am still very anxious and sad that i wont see my boyfriend for some time... He lives in country right next to mine. It doesnt seem like our cases of covid19 are severe like in other states, but I heard someting about borders being closed for couple months or years in our country depending on others states. It makes me very confused and anxious. Does it mean that I wont see him, even though our two countries will be completely clean just because of those countries that will still be infected? That thought makes my already bad mental health worsen.",

I dont think Im depressed or anything, but if I was given the option to never have existed I would take it. I never asked for life and I dont think I want it. The only thing keeping me going I suppose is the trauma I would inflict if people found my body in my apartment.

    "Need help with self-sabotaging behaviors. So I have been tapering off my medications now. I have been on medications for over 5 years, and it has not helped in managing my anxiety or depression. I feel more energetic now. The issue is, there is a demon lurking in my mind which comes out from time to time and creates havoc. For example I had saved a huge chunk of money from my first salary I received last month. Spent money carefully, was responsible enough, etc. A couple of days back, I grew so emotional and reacted so badly to some things that cried till my eyes, body and joints hurt. My body fell numb and I couldnt move out of the bed. I ended up spending 75 of my savings on things that neither helped me elevate my mood or had any practical use. This is not the first time either. Everytime I tend to do something right, I would do something extremely irrational immediately and try to spoil the one good thing that I have. I constantly think of running away from my house and live a quiet life in the suburbs, where no one knows who I am and where I come from. I have lost trust in myself to an extent that I depend on validation from others for my every little feeling. I dont trust what I think or feel at all. I am lost and can see only death as a solution from this unending misery. Has anyone been through this before and got out of it successfully? If not, what are you currently trying rhaf may may not be working? Please provide some solutions that I can actually apply to my life and not the philosophical or religious ones, I have had enough of those.",
    "How to make a sweatshirt I spent weeks designing feel like mine again? So back when my ex and I were together. I made yet 2 custom matching sweatshirts. I spent weeks designing them. Countless hours all gone and wasted when she left me. I put it in a box and tucked it in the farthest corner of the house that I could along with other memories. How do I make it feel like mine again. How do I unlink it from her. I put so much time and effort to make it. But it pains me to look at it and it hurts even more to wear it. I tried wearing it the other day and immediately took it off. It gave me such a rush of memories. We both wore those sweatshirts together for a month straight. And just holding it makes me miss her. Idk what to do. I want to wear it again but theres so much behind it that it is so hard.",
    "\"I hate myself\" ... Change from CBT to psychoanalytic? Hi, maybe someone got some insight into this. I have been in cognitive behavioral therapy for years. While it helped me coping with rumination and anxiety, I still dont like myself very much. I am often under the impression I should be someone else, someone better... be more manly, be more independent, be more active... well, it goes on for a while  Now, recently a friend got me to think about my childhood, and one thing stood out. In 3rd or 4th grade I wrote the sentence I hate myself over and over again in some of my school notebooks. None of the teachers seemed to notice it  at least I dont remember ever being asked about it. Also I seem to have a lot less memories about my childhood than other people. My mum told me three years ago, after I just came out of a twomonth stationary therapy and mentioned to her that I have some gaps in my memory, that I had a happy childhood. I have no reason to doubt her honesty, but I know she is able to see things the way she wants them to. Also, I want to cry all the time, but I cant. It often is on the edge, but mostly it stays there, or just a few seconds of real crying and then I get too selfconscious, I guess, and it stops. Its killing me... like something wanting to get out... Im 31 and just want to cry a whole day like a baby, but I cant. Is it maybe time to go an oldschool psychoanalytic approach? I just have vague notions of couches and old bearded men and hypnosis My therapist is great, but there is no real breakthrough. It always feels like there must be more. I even consider trying psychedelics now to help me get to the root. Well, that was a lot. Any help, insight, comment is appreciated. No native speaker, so please ask if anything is unclear.",
    "I don’t know what’s going on And then that summer I got my shit together, started training for soccer,and I thought I healed. But I guess I didnt because junior year here we are. I feel abandoned. I feel alone. I feel lost. These things never bothered me before, but why now???? WHY IS IT PULLING ME DOWN NOW? I NEVER HAD PROBLEMS THESE PROBLEMS ALL JUNIOR YEAR?! You know my ex, got over me so quick. She already found a prom date, and she and her best friend replaced me with another guy. Double replaced. This guy they replaced me with is annoying as hell though, but hes so much smarter and more athletic than me. I guess they did better than I did. Im just here alone, no one to have my back. I guarantee you, no one would give two fucks about me. No one thinks about me. No one is there to check up on me. I have no one. And its killing me. I thought loneliness was strenght, cus Kobe was lonely, and he became one of the greatest athletes of all time. So I thought me being lonely was gonna help.

    "What would be the best way to talk to my S.O. about getting help tomorrow when it's a really upsetting subject for her even though she needs it? She tells her parents who are doing a very shit job at looking after their daughter btw that shes just not feeling well or she pretends to eat and gets away with it. She also has terrible mood swings, one minute shes happy, joyful, playful, laughing, the next shes depressed, crying, suffocating herself in her blanket, cutting herself..... this is all over facetime because her parents are not allowing me to see her as they are very strict so her mood just changes out of nowhere and whenever I try to bring up her needing help or asking if somethings wrong she gets really upset. Shes terrible at taking care of herself and has proclaimed many times I hate myself, thats why but never goes into detail. She names many things about herself that she hates but I dont think those are why she does everything she does, and if it is thats why I suggest for her to get help but she refuses all the time. She never eats, never drinks water, barely sleeps, does everything she can when shes sick to make herself worse such as drinking coffee and staying up, she never takes her medication, she purposely hurts herself, she doesnt open up, she doesnt respect her own values and boundaries, hell she threw away her inhaler because of whatever reason but she needs it so she doesnt die from a coughing fit due to her thyroidism, which she doesnt do anything to help either. She never allows herself to warm up when shes cold, she suffocates herself in a blanket, she doesnt take her meds for it, its sad more than it is upsetting if Im being honest. Lately she has been getting rid ofblocking out people who are helping her, which is why Im glad I convinced her to let me talk to her about this tomorrow, but anyways she convinced her stupid ass useless parents that she doesnt need a therapist anymore, she doesnt tell her doctor anything, she doesnt open up to her parents understandable because they get mad or brush it off.",
    "Dealing with toxic parents and mental illnesses I have a friend whom Im doing my best to support. She has grave issues with her family. Her father is extremely toxic, he calls her names, does not allow certain things, picks on her physically. Her little sister has learned this behavior from her father and does the same thing, but more often. Actually, she hates to stay home and spends her days outside or someplace like a cafe, college, rpg clubs. She has ridiculously low selfesteem and cant see anything good in her life. Looks like she gets really happy and emotional if I take a walk with her, invite her for lunch or just chat with her, but reality hits her harder and I cant be there for her every time. Moreover, she has mental illnesses like anxiety and panic attacks that are provoked by extreme emotions happiness, fear, sadness and need medication to fight it.

    "Can't eat or drink In the middle of a pretty bad depression spiral right now and just cant eat. after two days of not eating, I started a food log to make sure that I am at least getting enough for basic survival, and installed an app on my phone to remind me to drink water, but it is just getting harder to ingest anything. I saw these weird emergency ration bars that seem to have all the calories nutrients you need for a day in a few small bites and ordered those. I dont know if they will help or anything, but its becoming harder every day. I feel like a failure for not being able to do basic human things, which only pushes the depression spiral further. I find myself playing this sick game where I see how long I can put off eating or drinking, which is really just a facade to make me feel like I have some control over the matter. I just dont know what to do anymore to not feel this awful. I only have two modes anymore, sad and numb, and I am just so damn tired all the time. I constantly find myself wishing for someone to just come out of the shadows and kill me, since I cant seem to do it myself. Maybe the loss of appetite is my body trying to do it for me.

Life is fucking miserable. I cant make sense of anything. If I try to make a point, an argument shuts it down. Then I question my view, change it or adapt it, then argue that point, then it gets shut down. Its as if there is no truth in the world at all and nothing is real. Its so goddamn frustrating it makes me break down. And then I think about how Ill never be like a normal person who can just be themselves and move on with their lives. I feel guilty for everything I do that I cant prove is the right thing. I just want to die all of the time and I even think about it in the middle of working or playing music, even during these intense moments where I should be focused I can only long for death and a cessation to the pain. Im also in physical pain from multiple injuries that are long term and past drug abuse which Im sure fucked my body up. Im too afraid to actually kill myself because I know Ill just go into a void and my go clings onto life selfishly. I probably dont deserve to live though I make sure to tell myself I do. It doesnt help. I just want one thing to make sense in life, but everything is so confusing and Im no good at any of it. Ill start my semesters of college with straight As, keep them till 23rds of the way through, then lose focus and end up with Cs or D and have to retake some classes.",
    "I need help, TW SuçI∂e Well Hello to all the people reading this. so Im going to have to be careful with the information I disclose, as my situation is precarious to say the least. So Ive made some mistakes, I hurt some people in ways that arent bad but I had to make it clear that I am not an angel, nor am I the devil. When I hurt those people, a lot of people, people who really dont like me but have nothing to do with this started finding ways to ruin my life. I was accused of leaking a 14 year olds nudes, raping someone, lying about my age, and sending my nudes to people who didnt want it the reality they asked. Some guy accused me on his story publicly and since he has a ton of followers and people on his side so people immediately took his side of the story, without ever taking a deeper look. Ive gotten my own nudes leaked to almost everyone in this city, outside the country, friends relatives family. The pics and vids were sent to my parents as evidence and then my cousins and extended family. A tiktok was posted with my nudes in it and in like 3 hours it had more than 80K views, and by the time it had got taken down it had reached 380K views, and was then shared privately between the hundreds of thousands of people who saved it. Everywhere. In addition, Ive gotten death threats, people trying to find where I live and where I go to school. Ive lost every single one of my friends, not one has remained. I feel so lost and confused. Some part of me feels like Im the bad guy and this is the consequence of my own actions, I mean I wasnt always 100 clear with my intentions. But then on the other hand theres people who are playing this just like a game. All they want to do is ruin me and since they have no direct evidence for their claims so instead they ruin my life. I cant feel safe anywhere, and hearing and reading what people are saying about me, about my nudes, about my private conversations with people just makes me hate life even more.",
    "I am depressed and I lost all of my friends. I feel so alone. This is not a great thing to say but I was frustrated and panicking at the time. Katie was with Amy and another girl at the time, and I thought Katie wouldnt show anyone and this was a private convo my mistake for thinking that would be true. Tonight, after feeling the gratification of helping her, Katie decided to tell me that the other girl she was with and Amy read what I said. I genuinely didnt say anything super mean, just that I was frustrated that as soon as she moves back, I get dropped. Katie told me the other girl she was with said that is just disrespectful and out of line. and Amy said, Im glad I know how she really feels about me. Sorry for the long story but now, I just feel like nothing. I feel that I mess up every friendship. But at the same time, I am frustrated with the fact that if they do anything to hurt me, it means nothing, but if I do anything I am automatically this horrible human being. They act as if they have done nothing to me. I left my group message with all my friends, which was my main source of support and I stopped talking to the boy who finally told me he has lost all romantic feelings for me. He talked to me every day for about a month after he ended things and said he still had feelings for me for the longest time. I feel so alone and like I have hit rock bottom once again. I feel suicidal but I know myself enough to know I wont do anything. I dont want to die I want the pain and hurt to stop. I just wish people would care for me the amount I care for them. I wish people actually understand that they hurt me and, not to be selfcentered, but put themselves in my shoes for just a second.",

    "First post ever, need help This is my first post ever. Im not diagnosed because Im scared to ask my parents to take me to see someone. Severe anxiety and depression along with bipolar disease are all common in my family. Im the only one who hasnt gone to therapy. I cant remember being truly happy. I remember all the way in kindergarten, so anxious about starting first grade, I had sleep paralysis for the first time. I cry constantly in private. I feel trapped in my parents expectations. I would love to be sad on the outside and just cry it out sometimes, but they expect me to be happy. I play softball and volleyball, I used to do kickboxing. My parents expect me to be a badass who smiles while they kick ass. Ive been hiding how sad, alone, and numb I feel for years. I have addadhd I cant get a straight answer from my mom so its hard to focus. They offered me meds, but my mom said no. I was bullied severely last year, I was told to kill myself several times. Im going in to high school in a different school district. Im coming out of a funk, but I know Ill go back down in a week. My parents yell at me for everything. My sister has called me fat, ugly, and stupid for as long as I can remember. I dont know what to do or who to tell. I broke down and cried for hours on end to my best friend. She understood and was shocked because of how Ive hid it all these years. Can anyone offer any advice. Anything anyone can offer will be appreciated.",
    "I have a friend (she's my cousin but we're very close) who's talking about trying to kill herself and starving herself. Do I go to the guidance counselor? My friend is really struggling right now and is trying not to eat. I found out from a mutual friend a guy shes talking to romantically and she admitted it to me very willingly herself. She showed me their texts and she was talking about doing it because she wants to kill herself so she wont listen to anyone who tells her to get help. Im thinking about going to the guidance counselor because she already expressed that her parents wont schedule her an appointment even though shes asked. Shes diagnosed with depression because shes had one appointment but never got another. I dont want her to be upset with me and shes telling me herself to force her to eat. So I dont know if I should wait it out or go to the counselor.",
    "I hate myself so much, I don't deserve to live I am probably the most disgusting person in the world, or at least I feel like that. I dont have many friends and that for a reason, I never grant people any success because I get jealous of it. I wish people unluck so that I can catch up with them, how pathetic. I think about peoples flaws and start judging them based on that. I develop a unnecessary hate towards them, gossip behind backs and more. I also feel like I dont really have any unique characteristics personality. Iam boring, I never have an own opinion, I just clinge to the opinions of those that I admire and plan on back stabbing them once im done with all the dick sucking. Iam just waste of flesh, i should have been aborted, and no iam not just in this mood at the moment, thats how I always feel, I realized it a long time ago but there is just not a cure for my hate jealousy and whatever sin from the Bible I embody. If God exists and if he truly punishes those who deserve it, than why am I not already dead. Also why cant I change, why was I born this way, why was I bullied so hard in high school, why am I gay, why could I never experience love till now? Just end me so that no one has to deal with me anymore.",
    "Myself is one thing, my work is another I have been struggling with depression for most of my life, some years better than others. For the past year, I have tried different medications and therapy but nothing seems to help and I feel so ashamed. I am hardly able to carry out basic tasks, brushing teeth, showering, changing clothes etc. I live with my two best friends who help when they can especially when my hair becomes matted but besides not being able to care for myself my work is falling behind. Ive told my boss that I am struggling through some things trying to explain the number of doctors appointments but I am not meeting deadlines, cannot seem to keep up with my work space and I am scared I could lose my job. I just wanted to ask if anyone had a tips for coping during a work day or how to approach new projects when every interaction makes me exhausted. I work a 9 to 5 and for my breaks I tend to sit in my car and just close my eyes. Any advice would be helpful. Thank you for reading all of that. This was my first post",

These past few days have been really tough for me because my gf hides a lot of her feelings from me, and its getting worse. I tried to provide a safe environment to talk about them many times but after she does tell them, she feels a little happy, but the anxiety is a lot worse. This was caused because of her ex in the past, and weve been working together to help for over 6 months. Shes definitely been getting better, but I cant help with this because she just lies, and when I try to tell her, she shuts me down worrying it will hurt me. And I just dont know what to do. She refuses therapy because of past situations, and I dont know how to approach this. Any help and experiences are greatly appreciated.

And once Im alone or free, I fall in a dark well and my mood changes. I really wanna cry but I cant. Yesterday, I turned off the light and put my headphones and started spinning for almost an hour. I fell on the floor and get up. Till I finally fell and couldnt get up. I stayed on the floor and couldnt move or feel anything. Then I had a panic attack. P. S. I take my medication regularly.

    "Where to go and how to get diagnosed. For years Ive gone through what I self diagnosed as episodes of depression. They usually last about a month or two of being super down and not having any drive to do anything at all. Im 21 now and it has been this way since 15 years old. When I was 17 I told my mom I was depressed and I told my guidance counselor in high school. Nothing came out of that except they sent me to a doctor to get blood drawn for some reason and I was sent on my way because the counselor said maybe I have a thyroid issue. Terrible counselor and terrible doctor. Never went back. Not blaming my mom either I just think she doesnt really understand what Im saying I feel. Ive talked to her about it a lot and she usually just tries to support me and tell me things will get better or youre just in a rut right now. Which can sometimes piss me off. But she is in no way doubting me or anything like that. She even told me to go see a therapist or doctor. But I dont know where to go or even how. Who do I go see to get a diagnosis? I dont want to be brushed off again. Instead of trying to self analyze my problems and try to treat them my own ways Id like to finally get closure and see if I really am depressed, or something else, or just dramatic.",
    "Husband triggered depression by sitting on bed with daughter So my father and I have had some innapropriate interactions over the years. Based on this and working in a field that is very aware of the high frequency of sexual abuse, I have tried really hard to raise my daughter with some modesty boundries to help protect her from grooming by predators. She is 14. At this age I have discussed this many times with my husband away from our daughter. He often gets what I would describe as vey chummy with her. Sitting very close, to do things, resting his arm on her leg and his voice changes pitch like he is playfully flirting and will even bat his eyes at her. I have repeatedly told him how uncomfortable it makes me and how the same behavior from my dad has really bothered me all these years and how horable it is to put a kid in a position to have to tell her father to give her space. Also it really triggers my depression. But, I would say the behavior has not stopped in any frequency. I am in a very bad bout of depression now. I started crying and tried to go to bed. But, they were on the bed looking at old photos. I walked out and walked back in to non verbaly hint that something was wrong. My husband acknowledged the look, but went back to what he was doing. I said I had to go to bed, it was very late. My hasband took our daughter and left, but I was so upset, I asked our daughter to please go to bed, it was getting pretty late. I did this because I wanted to talk privately with my husband about the issue. He exploded and says I am just poisoning my daughter against him. No concern about my depression or grooming concerns, just pure anger. He said he talked to his friends and everyone thinks I am trying to turn our daughter against him, based on this event.",

As this pandemic worsens as I am stuck at home and the choices are thinning out even the new hobbies. Reading books help me but its only temporary.

    "I kill myself if you don’t read My upbringing only perpetuated my depression. My single mom never gave me responsibilities and I had too much free time. Making it worse I was a nerd so having the option to just stay inside and play video games was heaven. Years went by without speaking with anyone or trying to build relationships. In my teen years that was basically suicide because who wants to be known as the loner. So I would skip days to keep my fragile ego safe. Thoughts go by in my head that if I could just at the very least get over my fear for rejection I could get my life in order. Because having an intimate relationship would really solve a lot of current issues I have. And so Im actively looking subconsciously and consciously because i am starving for intimacy. I know how that would look desperate maybe a bit crazy. And its not about sex its about completely being open and honest with another person. I feel I can only be this intimate with a girl and refuse to open up to such an extent to the access of other human beings in my life. Because the human being in my life were not driven by choice ie family, childhood friends Im in a pickle and it sucks, but if it wasnt for weed I would not be aware of my issues, stayed positive and attempt to help myself. This is only a recent discovery ever since joe Rogan started talking about how weed paranoias actually help you figure out what is actually stressing you out. Thats the worst about depression, every action you do against yourself feels justified and logical. Its truly a terrible disease and I hope I survive this. Sorry about title Im just so desperate I apologize for my existence.",

The episodes were years ago, but when I look at everything together I jus think wow... 4. I have been in basically a sexless marriage for 19 years. 5. I have cheated by getting happy endings and watching porn. I feel horrible about this. 6. I am unemployed. I cant keep a job. No one will hire me. I am an older worker and dont know what to do. 7.

Like any other 16 year old guy I want to have sex, but I dont want to just do a hook up or a one time thing with someone who doesnt mean anything to me. I really only want to have sex with someone Im really emotionally attached too, and I also want my first time to be with someone else who hasnt done it yet. I kinda just assumed that sex would come in its own time until I broke up with my girlfriend about a month ago, where now Im being told that I should avoid relationships for the sake of my mental health. She was also the one who demeaned me for not having had sex before and sorta the reason I need it to be someone elses first time too. She basically made fun of me for not having had sex before, and I never really cared about losing my vcard, but now Im thinking about how belittled I feel knowing that I havent had sex whereas many of my friends have and now I notice all of them sorta expect me to have it as well, and even though I want it to be special and real they still see me differently for not having had it some contextmy friends are also fucking nerds and it is beyond me how any of them have had sex yet.

    "My suicidal long-distance friend often does not respond to me for days and idk what to think about it, how can I help her? So a few months ago I befriended a girl which whom I have a connection like with no one else. Unfortunately her mental health has been declining recently, she had a suicide attempt. I am extremely worried for her, last time we talked she told me I dont have to worry for her because she doesnt have the means to commit suicide, but its still extremely worrying. I told her that I want to meet her, that I can come in a few months. I texted her everyday but since a few weeks she rarely views my messages leaving them unread, despite her being online. She says that its from anxiety and brain fog and I want to believe her, because being ignored is something I really dont like. That also of course makes me worried for her as fuck. I guess that calling her would probably be rude and will cause her discomfort? I dont know if I can do anything for her? I wanted to support her with talking to her but right now I cant even do that. I dont have any contact to her family, and contacting them would probably make her upset. She has a long distance boyfriend but he is also kinda shady as he is a source of her depression and he often ignores my messages too. Any advice wiil be appreciated",
    "I feel like a failure, because I'm failing to get certain things done I am really struggling with certain aspects of my life, I cant get motivated. I am diagnosed with depression and anxiety and have been receiving various forms of therapy for the past two years since my son was born. I believe that I have suffered with depression since way before my son was born but the signs werent recognised until I was being seen by a health professional regularly. I am very lucky to have a roof over my head, a loving husband and a full time job. However, I cannot seem to escape the void of depression. Currently Im in a the crippling pit, and I cannot motivate myself with certain things. I dont take my medication, I know I should but I have some sort of mental block that stops me taking it. My work is suffering because Ive found a way to get by, doing the day to day tasks but not doing my daily reports. I would describe myself as high functioning depressed as I can get out of bed and get dressed, but the only reason I do this is my son. I live with my husband and in laws and Ive just realised that Im not happy anywhere. Im not happy at work, Im not happy at home. I get on well with my in laws but they drive me crazy by parenting my son. At work I feel out of my depth and like Im just winging it, badly. I just want to escape, and the only way I can think of to escape is suicide but I cant bear the thought of not seeing my son grow up. He is my lifeline but what kind of mother is he growing up with? I cannot motivate myself to tidy up after myself, only my son. I cant motivate myself to take my meds, check in with my therapist, or complete my work properly.

    "Is my \"popular\" intensive trauma program abusive/unfit/re-traumatizing for me? This was the ONLY personalized meeting I have had in this program  everything else was groups or front desk people doing questionnaires. 4 I have had no meeting with anyone during or before the program regarding what I need or how this program is customized to me. 5 almost every individual in the program is on medication and there seems to be general push towards strong sedating medication. Most members could not even sit up during groups due to the level of sedation. 6 I have corrected the clinicians and staff over 4 times in a single day with the name they use for me and they continue to use incorrect names for me. I dont feel respected. 7 The staff seems to treat every action of every client as a sickness. For example, a woman felt emotional anger when someone was rude towards her in public  the staff fixated on the validity or invalidity of that anger instead of the safety needs in that situation. 8 The staff and the program itself feels very paternalizing. Example  a clinician did an activity asking everyone to name vacation spots that start with F before jumping into talking about emotional dysregulation and severe distress. The clinician an intern in training had a color wheel with activities at the level of a 4th grader for an adult group. 9 The program is apparently owned by a forprofit company and has dangerously negative reviews on google by clients and on LinkedInGlassdoor by staff. ampx200B How do I navigate my care when Im feeling unsupported by the current treatment?",

My finals are coming up really soon and Im so terrified of not doing well. And I dont know if Im just imagining things but it feels like things are falling apart with my best friends too.

No ones asked me how Im doing, but I also dont want to dump my problems onto anyone. It feels like my friends wouldnt care anyway. So much has changed, theyve changed so much since the first year.

    "Everything Feels Too Overwhelming I feel overwhelmed at the slightest things. This has been happening for a long, long time but it just keeps getting worse. Some days are better than others. Today is a bad day. I quite my job in January to live my dream of being a fulltime artist. I am failing so hard. Yes, COVID really impacted everything but if Im being completely honest, I was never cut out for this to begin with. Ive taken on commissioned work that is months overdue because the thought of starting is so overwhelming. I keep telling myself, tomorrow I will start and I feel relieved. I wanted to make art today first time in months and even got excited at the idea of going to the art store, but then I just thought it will just be another piece that sits there and goes unfinished. I killed all of my excitement before I even did anything. This isnt me. I used to love to create art more than anything and spent almost every spare second painting.

I built the new website back in February and was SO proud and excited about it. I havent touched it since. I want to, I want to work on it, but now I have SO many pieces of clothing that need to be cleaned, photographed, listed, measured, that its again....overwhelming. I cant bring myself to start and just look at all the beautiful clothing just sitting there every single day. Some days I scroll through my phone for hours because Im looking for a sign or a solution. Im wasting my life. I hate feeling this way. I hate living this way. Im unhappy no matter what I do and Im feeling SO much guilt for letting so many people down. Im 30 years old too old to be acting this way. Its so shameful.

Now its come to the point where I dont believe things will work out . Not comparing but cant stop thoughts of being scared for myself , when I hear everyone in my batch has a job . I used to be a person who would wake up before sunrise , eat healthy , read books and learn new things . I was someone who would never skip a workout , eat only clean foods , meditate every day and take care of my skin. Now, I dont get out of my bed and dont even look forward to the next day , cos its the same thing on loop , pushing myself to apply for jobs with no belief in whatever I am doing . I miss my workouts and feel lazy to cook for myself , I will order food from a restaurant often which does not feel good after eating at all . I can not do anything other that eating and sleeping . I miss the old me , I used to be a very strong woman . People used to compliment me for my mental strength. I have been through a lot in the past and have overcome it but this time I am unable to get myself back . I dont know this me . Above all this , I live with a roommate who for some reason enjoys when I get rejected from an interview. I have seen that on his face . Even when he knows that I didnt get the job he would on purpose ask me again how did my interview go . Other than that he cares about nothing , and has a very weird vibe . He talks about me to his friends, I dont even know these people and when they come home , they literally know each and everything about me . And to add to this, I feel the need for someone to tell me that I am good enough but I dont get it . I seek that from my father but he is just worried that if I will find a job or not . He doesnt say that out loud but I can read that from our conversations , so I dont feel like speaking at home . I dont know whats so wrong with me that I can just lose myself like this . I want me back .",
    "Advice on how to deal/make progress So, Im currently in a hole with my depression, and I could use some advice on what to do and ideas on how to approach things, as Ive done a lot already. Its a bit of a story, but I will keep it as brief as possible. If youre reading this and want to help, thanks in advance! So depression has been a thing all my life, but I only got a diagnosis around 10 years ago Im 33. I am also disabled, having a diagnosis of autism and suffering from chronic fatigue. I got therapy, and eventually, medication. The therapy CBTlike didnt really help, but at least talking to someone was nice at times I had a good therapist. The medication did help. I was put on 50mg sertraline. Fast forward a few years, and I start to do worse. I get sick with bowel pain that appears to be persistent. A few other difficult things in my life happen, and my depression starts coming back. The pain eventually becomes so hindering I have to stop work entirely. I get a pretty intense comprehensive therapy program for dealing with unexplained symptoms, and it is overwhelming. I lapse back into deep depression. The decision is made to up my dose to 100mg sertraline, and I climb out of it. The lessons I learn from therapy eventually help, and helps me control the pain and lessen it somewhat, although the fatigue actually intensifies. Fast forward to around now, covid times. Turns out, telling someone with a tendency for severe depression stay inside and have as little contact as possible is a recipe for bad times. I live in a place where I dont have a social network, a result of them moving away and me trying but so far being unable to because disability and dependency on social housing, which is a mess. So events were very important to me, and theyve all been canceled now for about a year and a half. I honestly do pretty well for around 10 months longer than I expected, before things get bad and I seek out my psych again. The decision is made to up my sertraline dose to 150mg, although I note I am seeing a pattern of it stopping working every 3 years.",
    "Birthday tomorrow... Well tomorrow is my birthday. I feel numb. You could hit me and I wouldnt feel it. I usually get all excited and think about how to do my hair and make up, what I want to eat for dinner. I remember all my past birthdays. The past few weeks I have just thought about ending it. Im not going to but I cant stop thinking about it. My life feels worthless. I dont feel like I help anyone. Obviously we cant see too much of our family right now but that wouldnt matter because we dont all get along. My dad re married when I was 14. They had another kid. Same exact birthday as mine although 17 years apart. She is the golden child. They even had a drive by birthday thing for her to sing happy birthday. Im under 26. Dont want to say my exact age. I get Im older and I get the older you get birthdays kinda get less exciting. But I feel like dirt on the ground to people around me. I feel lonely and I feel sad I dont feel excitement. Again its just another day but it feels shitty. Maybe its the memories I miss I dont know. Just wanted to get it off my chest. Im scared to wake up tomorrow. Im scared to have another year like I just had. I dont think I can survive it. I barely survived this one. This isnt a oh I hope Reddit wishes me happy bday for validation post. I just feel like sometimes on here I can share and get it out there. I dont really have an outlet. Thank you for listening.",
    "I feel like I need to die Hello, Im 23 at the present moment, Ive been on therapy and antidepressants for almost three years, had some highs and bearable lows through this time, but I had some breakdowns that really feel worse each time it comes around, like a neverending cycle, and Im passing through one right now. I feel helpless, unable to reach out to anyone either because they dont care, or they just dont know how to help me and that makes me feel even worse. I feel like my mood naturally pushes them away. I dont know if I want to hear anyone say hey pal, this is temporary, youll feel better later because this also means that I will feel like this again in the future too, and I just need it to stop once and for all, I dont know if I can fight much longer.",
    "I can’t help myself, and there is nowhere to get help. I also noticed that I have an obsession with pain. I noticed that there is not a day that goes by without me thinking about all the horrible things that are happening in the world, all the terrible things that may and will happen to me, how Im hurting my parents by lying to them, how I should be ashamed of myself, and after I go on about this for some time I start to think about how I am selfish for indulging in my own thoughts and problems so much. I also have IBS. It used to be not very bad but these days I sometimes come very close to having a nervous breakdown because of how much pain it causes. I sometimes take almost freezing showers to stop the pain, because my body goes into were dying mode and blocks the pain from my bowels. I feel ashamed of myself. Im living a better life than 90 percent of the world. I dont have to worry about food, getting ill, getting killed or not having a shelter. I live in a clean home. I can take a shower whenever I want. Both my parents are still alive and well. But I dont feel okay. And whining about not feeling okay makes me feel very privileged. But Im not okay. I used to be very into electronics. I used to spend a lot of time into mathematics so that I can understand how electronic circuits work. I actually built my first shortwave radio when I was 12. I was dreaming of becoming an electronics engineer. I always had issues with my gender identity, but it used to be not so bad. Its strange really. Back in the old days, people had a lot of life threatening problems. There were plagues, long and bloody wars, famine etc. I feel very privileged for feeling bad about my issues. And Im not the only one with these problems, and majority of the people in the world has much bigger problems, I know that. But they still try to keep going, but I cant keep going. I cant help myself, I just cant. There is no one that can help me either, and I feel cornered. I dont know what to do.",
    "Antidepressants Antidepressants Hi! Ive been thinking to take antidepressants for a while now. I have sudden outbursts or breakdown episodes ? wherein I just cry and cry. I can feel the physical pain in my chest, or heart, specifically. Its so heavy. Ive been seeing a psychotherapist for a few months already, but it doesnt seem to help. It started because of work which I already resigned from 2 months ago. And then this pandoras box collection of traumatic events in my subconscious seem to have been opened so Ive been still experiencing the breakdowns despite seeing a psychologist. For people who took antidepressants Was it worth it? How was your experience with it? Did it help? Im sorry I just needed answers. I have no friends who took antidepressants before. Im also shy to reach to them, especially now that I need them the most. Thank you, strangers.",

Then went out to get my brother from practice and barely trusted me home alone. Im terrified of her telling my dad as I dont wanna disappoint him, and I feel like a shit daughter for making her cry. Ive had numerous anxiety attacks and I dont know how to cope with it all and where to go from here. What if she hates me now or treats me like Im crazy. Im so overwhelmed and I just want a hug",
    "Years of worsening chronic fatigue/fog continue to cripple my life As a result, I feel intoxicated more easilyquickly. Sometimes 1 beer and Im already feeling really drunk. Im slow now both mentally and physically. Head almost always feels very tired and heavy, but I dont get headaches that often. I yawn way too much. Anhedonia and apathy as Ive gotten tireder and tireder. I have gradually become indifferent to most things. I literally come across like an emotionless zombie now because I am so damn exhausted 247. Almost nothing phases or interests me anymore. I feel like I get every coldflu virus that comes around. And it takes me much longer to get over them. I am emotionally flat lined. One of my eyelids droops a little bit, mostly later in the day andor when Im more tired. I feel like I need lots of sleep to recover, but all sleep really does is reset me a little bit and is very unrefreshing. All of these symptoms seem to be worse when Im sick, stressed, get less sleep, etc. Overall, it feels like I was hit by a truck. From the moment I wake up to the moment I pass out from sheer exhaustion at night. Everything feels like its suppressed by this fog that has gradually gotten worse over time. For example, caffeines effect, sex drive, postworkout adrenaline and endorphins, getting plenty of sleep, etc. I can sort of FEEL all these things for the most part, but it feels hidden and pushed down from this utter exhaustion. Its like nothing can surpass the fatigue and fog. Its gotten to the point where I feel like Im living my life from the backseat and am just going through the day mindlessly on autopilot. It literally gives me anxiety and depression to feel like this and not know why, and watch my life just pass me by at the same time. And the thing that sucks is that I WANT to do things and live life, and am still pretty optimistic, but Im just too out of it, its embarrassing. I come across like a drugged zombie when I try.",
    "Depression after my scoliosis surgery Hello everyone, Ive had a surgery on 10th of February, since my scoliosis reached about 60. I was happy I was getting the surgery at first, seeing it as an investment in the future. Without it, I would have experienced extreme pain in later stages of my life. However, after i woke up from the surgery Ive been hit with nightmarish pain, unable to sleep for almost two days. Since then, Ive been worried if I have made the right decision. Hearing nurses say that people are recovering after just three days got me really sad, as i can barely move around in my bed without major pain. Im feeling really desperate, as if there is no escaping from the pain, as I feel plenty of it even under hospital medications. I had a friend that underwent the very same surgery, i looked up to her as she was able to live easily with it, as if she never was on a surgery. Unfortunately, I fucked up our friendship because I was a dick. I greatly regret it since now i see what she had to go through and how strong she was. Now I have no one to reach out too about this. If someone has any experience with a scoliosis surgery or can help, please do Thank you",
    "Can you act seemingly okay on the outside while battling an episode on the inside? Nondepressed person checking in here, btw. Thank you in advance for all the help. I am wondering if you guys have any insight into why depression can push individuals to act so out of characteralmost as if they believe everything is completely okay when, in reality, they are suffering on the inside. I assume this falls along the lines of dissociation or psychosis? Could those be the result from experiencing an intense amount of triggers?",
    "How am I supposed to get help when no one will listen? Im in my late 20s and life has constantly taken a dump on me, I need to talk to a therapist, everything in life feels meaningless, nothing is fun anymore, and I cant take it. I came really close a few times in the spring to just ending it and realized I needed to get help. Talking with my friends didnt help, which is fair, theyre not professionals, but when I talked to my doctor he also kinda brushed off my concerns and gave me a referral to a therapist. I tried calling their offices multiple times but no one answered the phone or replied to the messages I left. Tried again with a different therapist but the same thing happened. I know my phone works and at this point I feel like the universe is just trying to tell me to kill myself, the only reason I havent is because I dont want to make my friends and family sad. What should I do here? I feel like trying again is just going to lead to failure and make feel worse, again. I wrote a few paragraphs about my situation but cut out all but the most relevant stuff, I can provide more info if needed, Im really just at a loss and dont know how much longer I can go on when everything seems to keep going wrong and I have so little to be proud of.",

    "I am so confused Ill be straight forward, Im not diagnosed yet. I havent really been checked so I may still very well suffer from the condition, but I apologize if I dont qualify to post here. So my problem begins maybe three years back. Out of nowhere Im randomly sad about myself for no reason in particular. I brushed it off as regular old sadness and have no other thought. Then a couple months later I notice its happening more and more frequently. I thought it could genuinely have been depression, but I was convinced into brushing it off as teen angst. Over the next year it stayed the same, random bouts of sadness and lack of motivation for a day or two at the time. Fast forward to now and Ive started being sad nearly daily. I can sometimes go a week and rarely close to a month without experiencing severely as I have, but like I said thats it sometimes. I have suicidal thoughts so often theyve stopped bothering me. I quite often cry at night and have recently started drinking when this happens. I sometimes think I want to die but I know there are people who care. I have a loving family and great friends. I just cant get what I want out of life and I dont want to live a long unfulfilled life. Dont get me wrong, Id much rather be happy and live for as long as possible, but part of me wants to give up. Im not asking for professional diagnosis, but would you say this is regular sadness or am I verging on depression? Thanks, anon",

I accepted before the shutdown, and started after restrictions were in place, so Ive spent the entire year alone in a new city as all social avenues were cut off. I almost have no socialization with coworkers either due to working remotely. I tried online dating, but that made things worse as I didnt match with anyone and sent me on a selfdoubting downward spiral.

Lately I noticed that I have been thinking about it more often though. I am saying this because I dont even know if things are actually getting worse. I cant even allow myself to feel bad because I dont really know if Im supposed to feel bad.

My parents worked hard to make sure I can get education. I am ashamed of myself for not doing what I needed to do. I am also ashamed of lying to them about my school.

    "Can't express emotions. As a kid I used to be very talkative and normal I guess. As I grew up I just got very emotionally closed off. Like I have this terrible habit of bottling everything in and not even showing expressions. This lack of emotional display really damaged me. It makes me look so unapprochable and boring. I am about to graduate so we do things like mock interviews, and this lack of expressionemotions had been pointed out by my teachers too. Help me how to overcome this and act like a human and not a zombie.",
    "My motivation has completely disappeared and I'm feeling overwhelmed by having so much to do. So Im 27, and a single mom for the last year to 2 amp 6 yr olds. Im currently a sahm working remotely for a few hours a week, going to be starting school online next month, and I will be looking for a job that provides more for my family. The trouble is Ive been battling post partum anxiety and depression since i had my last little one. So just a little more than 2 years. My depression had improved greatly in the last few months but recently its been fluctuating again I was sick for 2 weeks and now my kids are both sick as well as my roommate this has made things very difficult and Ive had a lot of health problems at the end of last year that made it difficult to get important things done. Well, now Ive reached a point where I have zero motivation. I just feel so overwhelmed by everything I have to get done and even making a to do list, and today sending it to my LDR partner with the idea that he will check at the end of the day to see how much I accomplished has done nothing except make me feel more depressed and anxious. Im having trouble thinking, Ive stopped eating properly and making sure to drink water every day my SO has been helping to encourage me to do these things properly and Im just having trouble making myself focus and chill out enough to get things done. Today I was going to do things... but then I had kids screaming and crying all day and I couldnt do hardly anything. Now its the end of the day, Ive managed to eat and drink water today more water than usual but not enough yet and Im just feeling really sick again. I dont know if its stress or if Im just burnt out or what it is. This might not even make any sense because Im having trouble thinking. I hate that I cant get myself motivated and actually accomplish things. I hate that I cant do better. I just feel like complete shit.",
    "I’m sorry for another dramatic rant lmao sorry if this is going to be annoying and stupid. you dont have to read this random rant ahah iF16 struggle with depression and anxiety in addition to some other mental disorders. i have the kindest friends in the whole universe. my parents pay for my therapist and my psychiatrist. i come from a quite privileged family. plus my school kindly allowed me to have an easier program than the rest of the school after i ended up at a mental hospital. however despite only studying 4 subjects i am failing all of them. most of the time i dont have energy to do anything, so i just watch Netflix. my homework keeps piling up and it gets more and more overwhelming. i become too anxious to face my teachers and my classmates, so i decide to stay at home. this leads to me feeling extremely guilty. i feel like a disappointment c i dont deserve any of the support and im just wasting everybodys time ehzhzhhsh whenever i catch up with my 4 classes i tend to think  everything is going to be alright from now on  but i always end up in the same place. in my room, in my bed. feeling like a burden and feeling like i will never accomplish anything. do i drop out of school?? do i get a job? im way too tired to do anything 0 anyways thank you so much for reading this. sending love and support to all of you lt3",
    "Vent: It's hard watching all my friends get married, travel the world, and accomplish big things while my own life is going nowhere. I just feel so damn lonely. Im broke, depressed, and my life isnt going anywhere. Why is everything so hard? Im trying to escape the rut Im in but its an uphill battle. Its hard for me to hold down a consistent job, still be creative and productive, and not want to yeet myself every day. I just dont get it...maybe I hit the Unlucky Lottery? Theres a part of me that just gets sadder when I see posts from my friends showing off their engagement rings or the places theyve traveled. Im not supposed to feel that way so I try to ignore it, but the emotion becomes so overwhelming that I can no longer ignore it. Im supposed to be happy for them. I should stop wallowing in pity. An unspoken pitfall of depression is that you can become quite selfabsorbed. Id love to be in a relationship, but not many people want to date the mentally ill guywhich I guess is reasonable. Another shitty thing is that my religion teaches youre not even allowed to think about sex before marriage, which makes my life so much harder now that I associate every urge I have with guilt. What am I to do? Just continue suffering without any hope of a better life? Why? Fuck me, man.",
    "At what point is someone ill enough to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital? Early this year, I tried to kill myself, and I asked my psychologist if I could be admitted to the government psychiatric hospital cant afford private so she she some research into it and they said that Im not ill enough. This time, I have a detailed plan with a guaranteed method of killing myself, theres no way it could fail, and a set date. But I want to go to the World Cup in Qatar next year. The thing is, as much as I want to go for that, the life that I face in the wait until then us quite horrific. Im going to be forced to go to university and I refuse to do that, but I know its going to result in massive fights with my family where Ill be cornered and ridiculed as a failure, and I wont have support support friends either because they agree that university is best for me. So Im wondering if I could perhaps find a way into the psychiatric hospital until its time to go to the World Cup so that I can avoid my awful life on the outside, or Ill be forced to kill myself and miss out on the World Cup.",

    "Running out of options At 30 ywars old, Ive been on a total of 8 antidepressants and anxiety meds since I was 14. A lot of things work for a while and then just...dont anymore. Ive been telling my psychiatrist that my current meds work fine, because the last thing I tried had horrible side effects and I didnt want to go through more of that again. In truth, Im not doing well. My depression is very much chemical and not situational. I feel like crying all the time for straight up no reason. I feel like...how much more can I try? Is the rest of my life going to be just a cycle of medications until theres nothing left? Does anyone else feel this? Have you found other things to try?",
    "Learning I have Alexithymia really fucked me up. Ive always accepted the fact that one day I will kill myself. I joke and say Im going to kill myself every once in awhile. Ive always felt empty and just figured that it was Depression and suicidal thoughts. I promised myself when I was little I would kill myself at 21, Im 23 now, Im on meds for depression and I go to a psychiatrist, I have a long term girlfriend who I can see a future with. However, that doesnt stop the fact that one day I will kill myself. I told my girlfriend I never want children or marriage because when I do kill myself itd be easier on everyone. I am getting a vasectomy soon so I dont have any dependents, Ive pushed people away, no, I forget other people exist because thats how much no one matters to me. A few days ago I learned that I have Alexithymia, which means I dont feel emotions. I never had a way of explaining how I feel until I found out what Alexithymia was. I have no feelings. I can not experience what I assume is one of the best things about being a human. I have no imagination, no creativity. I simply exist and thats it. Imagine playing a game thats in the first person. Thats my life, I just see stuff, I dont feel anything. Not to be cliché but I am nothing but a shell of a man. This really fucked me up, enough where I stare off, Im not very talkative and I get lost in my head that life truly is pointless. My girlfriend notices and shes kind of worried, she asked if I would be okay by myself before she left for work. I feel like this solidified that life is ultimately pointless, especially for me.

Literally, cant motivate myself to work, cant play video games, barely even have the energy to make this post and its only bc i know some other people care about me. But life isnt fun.

Doing things i dont want to do requires so much energy, never feels rewarding, and is just so painful. Sometimes it helps other people and that makes me happy.

Small goals dont feel rewarding and holding myself accountable never helps because I dont know why i should care what even i think. I know thats silly but thats literally how empty i am.

    "Depression, Depersonalization, Emotional Abuse. HELP. Since about November 2019 Ive started to experience symptoms of depression but i just thought it was some sort of phase or something since Im just a teenager but its now Jan 2021 and those symptoms have constantly been in my brain like they have almost become apart of me. Plus Ive started to experience a few symptoms of depersonalization disorder but once again its only a few and usually I only feel the symptoms to this when Im doing stuff I know my parents would yell at me for. For example one time I smoked weed with some people and In the moment I knew I shouldnt do it and but I felt like telling myself no was just like watching a movie and trying to tell the actor not to do something but what ever you say you cant change the outcome. I didnt get caught but that whole time I felt like I was just on autopilot. Idk if either of my cases could even be diagnosed because I only have a few of the symptoms but these symptoms are persistent but not all that are required to actually have the disorder. I feel like these stem from emotional abuse but once again i feel like the abuse is not like super bad but its there. Like Im consistently told Im the cause of stress in my house and I get yelled at for the littlest things but then an hour later theyll give me a hug and forget it ever happened  this happens everyday. I have a sense of isolation from my family like I live with them but Im like an outsider that doesnt belong. Also I feel like Im forgetting how to be myself like Im usually considered the funny guy or that guy just always knows how to have fun thats but like recently Ive noticed A LOT more of my jokes are missing and me being excited or funny comes off as trying too hard. I dont really know what Im asking for just any advice? So this was saved as a draft about 3 days ago and reading it again makes me realize that my situation is actually a little bit more sever that I thought.

That was almost 2 years ago, now i still cant leave house without taking good amount of benzos, i am non stop depressed and anxious and thanks to the IBS i have developed a panic disorder. I have tried everything that doctors could think of for the IBS itself but no luck. And for the mental problems, i have tried taking three types of SSRIs, SNRI, TCA and antipsychoticsin special dose to act like antianxiety meds and every one of them made me feel worse, one of them totaly broke me for two weeks. Tried therapy for months. And have been hospitalized for 10 days at psychiatric unit and left because i felt much worse there.

    "How should I do this 'homework' from a therapist Hello, I am struggling with some pieces of homework between sessions that the counsellor has given me. These are the tasks 1. Call my friends and tell them how I feel. 2. Ask 10 people to describe me in three words. Im struggling with both of these because  Im a 26yearold man. I was not brought up to have  much less talk about  feelings. Sure, trying to break that sounds great in theory but one of my friend group tried that a year or two ago and none of us knew what to say or do at all. We felt so awkward and just left it. Some of our friend group just said this guy had had a few bad days and was blowing it out of proportion not nasty but none of us know how to handle it. Family are out of the question sadly as they always become very angry with me for mentioning feelings  Telling friends I feel bad during a coronavirus pandemic is incredibly selfish weve all got problems  It would also be proving them right theyve been hassling me contsantly to come home even though itd be illegal to socialise with them in person anyway RN, so kinda pointless. Ive told them I feel better away from my parents for a bit longer, plus I can work on an essay Im writing for uni. I live in a student area and students dont seem to be panicbuying like other groups, so i just feel more comfortable here. Saying I feel bad despite feeling this way for 15 yearsish would just increase their feelings that I ought to move in with the parents. Im vehenmently against this  I know it sounds like Im being critical and just shitting on the counsellors ideas, but I dont think Im going to be able ot do these tasks  Im worried about disappointing the counsellor. Weve had two sessions and at the end of each he has asked me what I found most useful and because Im not really sure what to say I just say the first thing that comes to mind. We talked for 20 minutes about problems Ive had about my appearance and being bullied for being ugly for aroun 15 years now and he seemed to think by the end of the conversation that I was healed.",

    "Is this depression or something else? I noticed my bf had been acting off kind of aloof and withdrawn lately but every time I asked he said he was ok and just tired. Last night I asked again and he said hes ok but when he got home he told me that he doesnt feel right mentally like if something is off. He just wants to lock himself in his room all the time and he said its been a few months like this but that he is just now noticing it. He said he has low sexual attraction and Isnt in the mood much and is disgusted with the thought of sex but still loves me but its just more pure? Now hes had little bouts like this before and so I asked if its like the other times and he said no that he feels just blank. It sounds a lot like depression but I am not sure. Ive told him that he should go to the doctorphysiologist to get this checked in the past I almost got him to go in the past but the office in his network in my town did not have any appointments until several months down the road which is crazy IMO but he can be very stubborn on this. He usually gets out of them eventually but I get really worried and concerned for him and I dont want him to suffer with this. I wish I could just make it go away. Im here because I need help in determining if this is depression or something else and asking for your advice on things we can do to get him help  Im going to try again for the doctor  phycologist but I know its going to be difficult to get him to do this practically and things he can start doing that can help him get out of this.

On those first experiences, parties, all of the fun that teenagers do. I dont even feel comfortable talking to men, because I never had male friends I have never been invited to a party. I have never smoked or took alcohol I never spoke with someone other than my relatives on phone or skype Its hard for me to make friends now, because of lack of these experienced. Everyone has their friend group from high school, but I was bullied in middle and high school. Recently, my 17 cousin laughed at me because Im a virgin. Its true. I never had the opportunity to explore, because I had no one to explore things with And it hurts me, because I have no idea how to flirt with men or even keep a relationship. Recently, I was texting this guy and he weirded out that I never had sex or kissed someoneMy lack of experience pushed him away Without these necessary experiences its hard to be accepted. I feel like hanging myself. Help.",

    "Excessive drinking, help please Hello guys. A friend of mine has always been quite introvert. Preferably staying at home to read a book. He hated alcohol, partying and smoking. And he used to be very socially awkward. Since he became depressed, he started drinking and partying a lot. He also gets drunk quite often, sometimes this will make him scared and I would have to go get him. This isnt the person he used to be. And I know alcohol is bad for his Multiple Sclerosis and Depression. He is using antidepressants. But he doesnt seem to care. I dont recognize him when he behaves like that.. All the while he keeps ignoring peoples texts because he doesnt have the energy to respond. But apperently he does have te energy to party? Which is something i do not understand. I will have a talk with him tomorrow. What can I do or say to support him? How do I make him realize that his behavior is selfdestructive without making things worse? What could be his reason to drink so much alcohol? I really want to understand this huge change in personality, but I keep thinking that depression isnt an excuse for it. Please give me some insight.",

    "How do I tell my SO that I'm depressed, numb and think about suicide daily? Hello redditors! Throwaway Account Ive been depressed for several years now and because I have a hard time feeling any emotions at all I just pretend to and play along for the majority. I am not actively suicidal anymore but I still think about it daily and I cannot shake the automatic ... guess I can always kill myself. Only my best friend who is in a similar state of mind knows how I feel and the rest of my friends and family have no idea and I dont want to tell them for several reasons. I live with my SO and we have been living together for 2 years now. I think she knows that I am feeling blue a lot but I am certain she doesnt know how severe it is. Recently I have been thinking about how I could start a conversation if I chose to do so but I dont know how because she is emotionally unstable sometimes but not clinically depressed and only short periods of time. I am afraid that confiding in people will only make my living situation worse without actually helping my state of mind. I dont know what responses this may get but thanks anyways. I know this sounds like a douche thing to say and I appreciate the good intentions but please spare me the hang in there",
    "I’m tired of pushing forward. When my wife came home she seemed concerned but didnt really know how to react. She sort of pushed me away and told me to sleep it off. In the morning I wasnt any better and I didnt have the energy to get out of bed. My wife called my mother to come help and she did a decent job of making me feel better but I felt embarrassed about it. After she left I was disappointed that my wife wouldnt hug and just sit with me and instead just push for me to be back to normal. After this incident I definitely havent been as open about my thoughts because I know she doesnt really care or rather doesnt know what to do. I have noticed that recently when we argue I will have moments where I want to react in self harm. This comes usually around the time when my wife and I go into a the quiet part of our argument when everything has already been said but we havent come to a resolution yet. In both in a state of calm anger. In this time I always want to bang my head against to wall or take a kitchen knife to my arm. In the past I would tell my wife about these thoughts but it came across as me trying to manipulate her by threatening self harm so I know not to bring it up anymore. At this point I feel like Im in a downward spiral. I want to go back to when I put care into myself. When I gave my all every day. Now I feel like an empty shell pretending to live a happy life. By now both my mom and sister know its a facade but I cant admit to it. I was able to power through it and make my wife and son my reason to live, not just an excuse , but a real reason to push forward but now I feel like Ive lost steam. What can I do to help myself? I know I have to be there for my wife and son but I feel myself slipping.",
    "I'm 25y/o female from India. My depression keeps coming back in waves that pushes me into a full blown breakdown every few months. I don't know what to do. How do I get better? I have struggled with depression for a few years now. I live in a conservative family and my childhood was toxic, abusive and lonely. Things keep coming back to me now as I grow older. But Ive learnt to use my coping mechanisms and get better every time I start to fall into the darkness. However, two months back I had to deal with an abusive episode at home and I have not been able to bounce back. Im jobless. Im preparing for a competitive exam that requires me to study for at least 10 hrs a day and clearing it will mean freedom for me. All other options I have dont lead to freedom for me. Ive invested the last two years of my life in this and now the exam is just five months away but I find myself unable to even get out of bed on most days. The best day Ive had in two months was when I somehow managed to meditate and study for 3 hrs. Im fed up struggling and Im losing hope. But I want to get better and I want to be able to function and meet the demands of my life right now. I dont have the money or family support to consult a professional for help and so Ive come here as a last resort hoping that someone will be able to show me a light. I want to get better so bad. I believe its possible for me to create the life I want. Im just unable to see a way out of this darkness. Please help. How do I get better? What do I do to be able to stop feeling so lost and study? P. S. Due to my lack of access to a therapist Ive learnt all the tricks like exercising, meditating, Journaling. And Im trying these but nothing is working. I feel no joy even in things I used to love.",

    "Hi, Im fighting my way out of my depression but it is hard. Need tips on how to motivate myself again. And am learning new things with online courses and reading books that help give me meaning like Aristotle, Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus and Neitzche which helps give me purpose. But i struggle to motivate myself to take the extra step to get myself together and move forward with my life, Looking at job websites and stuff makes anxiety just make me freeze, or do anything i can to distract myself. Though i am fighting my depressive state, i cant help but feel apathetic about the world and about myself in it. I struggle to motivate myself because i struggle to see the point to. I have no real motivation to improve myself learn to drivecodetravel more i only seem to take interesting but impractical courses that have no physical use like the ancient history of food. But i feel this is just a distraction to . Apathy just feels like a slow death, and i know that the decisions i make now will shape the person i become in the future. When i try to motivate myself to learn these kinds of things, it is for material reasons, which dont appeal to me. I dont have any real motivations or dreams anymore that require me to learn them On selfreflection, a lot of these feelings of apathy come from two key problems in my life 1. Lack of and seeming inability to maintain meaningful relationships that sustain meit can be days between which i get a text. It is my fault, but i seem incapable of change no matter how much i try. 2. Lack of purpose or community, there is little in this world that sustains me spiritually, and a lot of the world seems shallow and just full of suffering. I struggle to connect with a world that seems so indifferent. Sorry if any of this comes across as whiny or selfpitying, that is not my intention. I could just use some tips and pointers from fellow people going through this on how they motivate themselves to build better lives for themselves. As I hate feeling this consistent nothingness and want to fight to lead a life that i can be proud of. Thank you for reading through my diatribe.",
    "Ever since I came out to my dad, he’s convinced I shouldn’t be depressed anymore. I came out to my dad as Agender about... 3 months ago? I think? Either way, hes not respecting me at all, and thinks that now that Ive come out, he can still call me by sheher pronouns and act like Im a girl, while Im also okay and experience no Gender Dysphoria at all. This is clearly not true. My parents being divorced already makes me depressed enough, then you add this, and tons of anxiety, you dont get a good result. In fact, you get the opposite, you get me. Dont really know what the point of this was, just wanted to put it out there that if anyone has any suggestions, it would be cool to hear them.",

    "Does anyone else totally disassociate when they're drunk? Okay, so I know that alcohol is a depressant and that it usually doesnt mix well when youre already depressed, but I wouldnt think a response to it would ever be consistently this bad. Long story short, went out for a few drinks with some work friends to celebrate my last day and the new job that I got. It was fun, these are people I like, and things were starting to get a bit better for me. Took 173 applications but I finally got a salaried gig, finally established a group of friends for myself after moving to a new city in a pandemic, found an advisor for my masters thesis. But at a certain point, maybe one or two beers past where I should have stopped, I just wasnt there. I left, didnt say goodbye to anyone, attempted to bike home, and cried on the side of the road after falling off my bike. Im usually a little bit of an emotional drunk, but I mostly just get affectionate and want to make sure my friends know that I love them. Its never been this, Ive never felt this outside of my own experience. Thoughts?",

Coz no one else understood me but him. Today my parents decided to stop talking or spending time with me. We have a duplex. I am supposed to stay in the upper flat.

    "I’m dying inside 💔😩 I wish I could stop all this major pain I feel. I want to impress but I also could care less about who thinks what. I wanted to make you feel proud, but we see how that went for all of us. I try hard everyday to make myself proud of my achievements but its just not worth it as much as it used to be. I used to be so proud and so excited to try my hardest for the things I loved, but notice that all of a sudden it doesnt seem to matter anymore kills me. Where did all my friends, family and love life go. Down the drain it feels like. So where do I go from here, do I keep trying or do I go get help bc I just dont feel like I can do much of this alone for much longer. Do I give up completely? To feel so damn alone is crushing me and to feel I mean less and less every day isnt exactly healthy. You wanna know how I made it out of my moms hell hole psycho rage house. Ill tell you, Im forever damaged and looking for full approval on things. I only end up attracting the worst people and I cant seem to keep a solid person in my life bc she ruined my way of judgment. My aunt tries hard to fix what I cant even fix myself. I just want to feel loved by friends and someone I hold so near and dear and care for. But to do that, I HAVE TO HAVE FRIENDS, and NO ANXIETY ABOUT MAKING FRIENDS, AND SOMEONE NOT HURTING ME. I fear everyday that Ill fall back into my old habits and go suicidal. I almost want to know what its like to do drugs and get away from this world. I feel the pain rush through my body like electricity. I practically enjoyed that one girls night that I got so wasted that I was slurring my words for once and passed out naked in my own house. I enjoy darker things and its getting to dark to decipher whats ok or not anymore. I hold in so much anger and pain that If I let it all out Id probably cry for a week straight.

    "How to help my husband not feel like he’s useless against my depression Ive been depressed for a long time now. Ive been struggling for as long as hes known me and it hasnt gotten any better throughout the course of our time together. Recently, hes been feeling like hes useless and cant do anything to help me when Im feeling really down and hes getting really frustrated. Needless to say this puts a strain on our relationship and how we communicate with each other. I dont know how to help him help me. Ive told him I just need him to be supportive and compassionate and loving but it frustrates him when he does that and Im still depressed. I think he understands that my mental health cant be fixed in a day but I hate that I make him feel like this. Has anyone been through something similar? How did you get throughmanage it?",
    "just need to tell someone this Im 17. Today is my Dads 70th birthday. That might be surprising to some people because thats pretty old to have a 17 year old son. Peers have made fun of me and said im probably mentally retarded since my Dad had me when he was so old. This isnt what the topic is though and it doesnt even bother me. What does bother me is that my Dads 70th birthday is just a reminder to me that I dont have much time left with him. At most another 10 years and thats optimistic. It just makes me so fucking sad beyond words to even think about. My Dad is my favorite person in the world and I can not even comprehend living a single day without him. I just wish so bad that I could be like every other fucking person and have a young Dad so I could have some more time with him. I truly dont know what Ill do when he passes. With how old he is, it feels like theres really no way of knowing, when. It makes me sick to even think about it. but the hard reality is is that he could really die this year even. Or he could miraculously live until 100. But deep down I know that I have less than 10 years with him and it FUCKING KILLS ME. anyways if you took the time to read this poorly written rant, thank you",
    "In love with my best friend who doesn’t see me like that. So Iv known this guy for over two years now and the moment I met him I started to fall for him. We are both mid 30s and have a real connection. We actually met from a online hook up at the beginning and he ended up staying here for a few nights, but after a week when I asked him for a date he said he wanted to stay friends as that was more important. I still remember how much it broke my heart then when he rejected me, but we hung out nearly every day. He stayed at my place most of the time and we just became really close. We sleep together whenever we stay at each others places, just cuddling. Over the years I have fallen deeper for him and I had already suffered with my own mental health before all this but now I feel so torn. He is literally my one and only friend, Im terrified of having another talk about my feelings with him in case I push him away again. We didnt speak for a few months as he wasnt very understanding that I couldnt stop loving him. I cried every single day when we stopped talking and this was during lockdown last year. It was awful, I think about him all the time and I have a lot of trouble sleeping with my mind just racing. Mostly When Im with him I genuinely feel myself and happy, but then I always wish for more. I dont know what to do, I feel like if i stepped away again from our friendship I wouldnt last. Its not that I want to end my life, but for awhile now I just wish I was dead. He keeps me tethered here, so I dont know do I just hide my feelings and say nothing and hope the friendship works. I would have been a very outgoing, proactive and positive person but I dont feel that anymore. I burst out crying a few times a day about my life, I dont really sleep, I cant really eat which isnt good cause Im already v skinny. Over the past few years Iv lost many friends to suicide so I know how terrible it is, but lately I really find myself understanding why they did it and tbh I dont have the guts to go through with it.",
    "All I want - is my death I need to write my dissertation, and I cannot concentrate, because my thoughts are not at all about studying. Over the past six months, I started having mental problems, and I cannot find the strength in myself even to go to a psychiatrist. And on the one hand, I would very much like to forget her, because I know that we will never even communicate with her now. On the other hand, I am so afraid to forget her, because for me she was the center of my universe. Hell, really, if I really had the opportunity to kill myself, if I had a bad relationship with my family, if I didnt know that my family would not survive this, I would go and kill myself at that very moment, when she said she didnt want to talk to me anymore. What I really would like right now is some inoperable cancer just to slowly fall into the grave. Im 26, and I have never been fully reciprocated by one girl. I visited 8 friend zones. But the most offensive is this one, the last one. Because Im an idiot. I know that she could be mine if I was more persistent. Now, I look at myself 5 years ago and want to shout to myself Idiot! You ruin everything! Take a step!, But I cant, because Im not a magician. I dont think so, but I know that I will never be happy in my life. That I would work a job that I would hate until my parents were gone. And right after that, Ill just kill myself, because it wont make sense for me to stay alive anymore. My sisters by this time will already be married, and will be able to live without me. Over the past six months, my life has sunk to such a bottom, into such an abyss, where it has never been before. And in the last month my life has ended. Only existence remains. The man who hoped for the future, who had dreams and hopes, is dead. And I, an empty shell filled with regrets, pain and depression  for some reason still alive. All I want is to die. And I can never want anything else again.",
    "No longer actively depressed but now I need help beating the apathy. I think my life has been changed forever by the major depressive episode I had last year. I dont think Ill ever feel quite like that again I hope, but its left me a parting gift. I just dont care about most things anymore. This is positive in some ways  it makes me less of a perfectionist for example good enough is fine and I dont get choked up on the little things as much. However, it is also very very negative in other ways. I will go for several weeks without doing my laundry, wait until the last second to do assignments, wont clean, etc. I have NO sense of urgency or shame, particularly urgency, but still have minor guilt after the fact if someone comments on my slobbishness. Like, if someone was coming over and I had an hour to clean I wouldnt get everything done. Id probably pick up a few things and say Im sorry for the mess and feel guilty afterwards that Im a slob. But it wouldnt make me change, however and that annoys me. I know that I do care that these things are happening, but theres a total disconnect from actually caring enough to do them respectably. For example, I would like to clean my room because I enjoy the look and space of a clean room. I know it makes me feel accomplished when I do. But a bigger part of my brain doesnt mind living in squalor because it is so apathetic to everything. I dont like this about myself. I want to be timely and disciplined but I have a hard time caring and almost 0 motivation though its slowly creeping back in occasionally. I feel this may be a discipline issue but I would also like some sense of motivation or ambition. I get like this with my career goals too. I want to want more for myself, but I dont act on it.",
    "Sometimes the worst part isn't what happened to us but being alone with the pain from what happened to us Ive had a crisis today from a breakdowntantrum in front of my parents and its late into the night that my friends who wouldve normally supported me are asleep and also all crisis phone or text lines are especially understaffed around this time. I dont use suicide hotlines or access amp crisis phone lines or text lines anymore all those things that my former therapists recommend because of how many times Ive felt worse afterwards or been hung up on dealing with someone whos already numbed and burned out themselves. I get it, the mental healthcare system is understaffed and underfunded and the therapists Ive had, its just been so disappointing and regressive to my health. Its just like the classic conditioning example if you shock a mouse enough times everytime it tries to eat food, itll be too afraid to eat even when the threat is long gone. Rarely are people seeking for advice and answers, most times people just want to be seen and heard and feel supported. I got angry at my mom for sharing some news with my brother on the phone, which was something she was talking highly of me for but nonetheless I felt very angry because I despise my brothers for how much theyve ruined my life and I had a tantrum in front of my parents because I was reminded of the last time my brother rubbed it in my face of my depression and financial situation when we fought and despite my mom giving him good news of mine hell probably use that to mock me with when Im back to a poorer financial situation again. Im hurt and angry and also guilty that I got angry at my mom who was just trying to talk highly of me but I very much want nothing to do with my brothers. Ive had a terrible relationship with my negligent parents all my life and Im fortunate that they actually feel guilty and sorry about all that and have been genuinely trying to help me now. I spent some money on something helpful for my mom that she very much uses and loves because Im grateful for her help which was what she was talking about and after getting angry at her but expressing it in an unhealthy way I feel like shit.",

    "My friend has been having lots of suicidal thoughts lately. I have known him for a year now, and hes studying abroad rn and Im still study at our homeland. He has been telling me about how he wants to kill himself lately, and reply less and less to my texts, or sometimes he just straight up ignored my texts and then came back with a text about killing himself. He has never talked about dying this much throughout the whole time weve known each other. I tried to talk to him, make him feel loved and other things that I think that can help him clear his mind a bit, but I dont really know if that can help him or not because hes so far away. He used to use antidepressants but he has stopped for quite a while now and he once confessed to me that he doesnt want to visit therapist or use antidepressants again. Can any of you here help me with some advice please? He is a close friend of mine, and Id die if he decides to stop living. Thank you in advance.",
    "I don't feel original anymore. When I was in high school a few years back, I was one of the highest competitors in my school. I joined the high school band in freshman year and by senior year I became one of the best in my section. My academics were always straight and I exercised daily. Senior year I enlisted in the military and now I believe it was one of my worst decisions in life. Before I went to boot camp I was motivated, a patriot and believed that the elite joined the military. In senior year I never applied for any scholarships and I was offered one but turned it down because I already signed the papers. I thought I set myself up for success. Now I believe I was dead wrong for joining. The only benefit I see so far after a year and a half of service is that Im trying to set myself up financially before I get out and hopefully attend college. It sounds like a plan but I feel no happiness from what I do at all. I convinced myself theres no honor in it anymore, its just another job. I dont exercise by myself anymore. I feel like Im not progressing anywhere in life being in service. Im just a body and if I wasnt here doing what Im doing, thered just be somebody else doing the exact same. Im replaceable. Thats the mindset the military gave me. I look forward to going back home in 6 months for vacation and thats the only thing Ive been looking forward to since Ive been stationed.

    "Deep depression and struggling marriage Hope this is withing the guidelines and acceptable Is there anyone going through something similar or can relate? Im in a marriage that I have been struggling for years and things just arent getting better. I am 30plus with 2 children under 6 yrs old and been marriedtogether 10ish years. If I get too emotional, I just get left alone till I calm down. Hasnt ever looked into how to help. I am not and never have been suicidal or wasnt to hurt myself or anyone. However, my depression can consume me sometimes and I have a day where I barely move, hah. I never let the kids see me like that, but it gets exhausting. I react emotionally and basically get ignored. If we fight or my spouse is mad at me and I cry, I get ignore. My spouse cries? Especially if its cuz Im mad, I feel like complete crap and try to fix it all day. I also have issues being honest with what I dont like. Like if something passed my internal boundaries, if I think saying something will upset someone I care about, I dont say anything. Theres a lot of other stuff going on as well but these.are not mentioned. So, is there anyone going through anything similar or can relate? Any thoughts, advise? Not sure how to end it",

    "I’m 23, highly anxious, depressed, raised by a narcissist/alcoholic, and need a job. I have no clue what to do with myself. Until Covid I worked in retailrestaurants my whole life as I am extremely personable, albeit an introvert. Now with covid, I very much so do not trust Americans wholeheartedly, Im getting the vaccine but everything is opening up at 100 no restrictions near me, which just makes no sense to me. Poor behavior amongst people these days, retail workers are the frontline of managing Covid and policies these days, for little pay. Now I dont even want these jobs as Ive not been social for over a year now. I did not go to college as I have learning disabilities. I also have awful fine motor skills, likely due to growing up anxious a lot due to alcohol in the house. Father has NEVER been abusive physically or frankly intentionally abusive, theyve never processed any emotions so theyre a mess. Still live with them and constantly triggered by it. I also am sorta addicted to weed, as I believe I have PTSD at this point so I truly feel its a need not a want at this point which is frustrating. I could go on and on lol, so, help? Im truly getting to the point it feels things just aint gonna work out for me, whole life has been out of my control. I was adopted, controlled by helicopter and anxious parents, now my anxiety runs my life, nothing is in my control or works out for me it seems. Anyways, thanks in advance for your responses, have a good day all!",

    "Should I use the psychological help service that my university provides for free? Lately Ive been feeling really low. I cant make myself leave the bed, I start crying out of the blue and everything is just so heavy. I think Ive always suffered from some kind of depression but Ive never been to therapy because I couldnt afford it on my own and my family didnt ever suspect anything. Now I live on my own in another city. Yesterday I discovered that my university provides psychological help for students for free. Do you think I should give it a go? Im a bit afraid because I dont know what to expect and I dont really know what to tell them when Ill be there. I know they dont provide help for very serious issues youll need a psychiatrist for that and I hope they dont take care for only university related problems. On the other hand, I have nothing to lose because its free. Did you ever try anything like that?",
    "Should I kill myself? I am the most uninteresting person and I feel like I am the only one who puts effort into any of my relationships. Ill call her Kayla. I have actually blocked of so much of my memory of her, like I remember maybe 3 or 4 moments over a year and 8 months or so of dating. We started of pretty good, but I believe we were both immature and didnt know how to set boundaries or handle a relationship. Which is what led to a lot of fighting. I do remember we fought a bit around a year into the relationship because she kept cancelling plans with me to go out and play games. Like I never tried to get in the way of her friendships, but she cancelled our anniversary date, and just a few other dates we set up literally the evening before or the morning of to hang out with friends. I told her that I wanted her to hang out with friends but the constant cancelling plans with me and not trying to reschedule was hurtful. Ahh, a lot of it is coming back now. I would honestly say we were a bit codependent, she relied on me for emotional support as her mother was extremely controlling, I relied on her for my social needs. Not a healthy relationship. We ended up breaking up after growing a bit distant, and at the end she played a bunch of games with me. Her mother didnt want me dating her which was the main reason we broke up. So she told me if I can convince her mom, shed let me get back with her. I didnt do this of course but I was distraught. I felt like I had nothing. I started playing piano in grade 11 but quit while we dated because of the effort it took. Most of my time went towards school and her. I ignored a lot of my friendships more than I should have during the relationship so I was in a terrible spot. It made me realize how unhealthy a person I was. I had struggles reaching out to the 3 friends or so I had because I always questioned whether they liked me. But when we broke up, they were there for me.",

He says it really judgementally and unsafe way, and hes usually shouting when he does it. it takes him a while before he starts shouting though. He doesnt even attempt to console me when i am crying. he scolds and shouts at me when im in public, like theres something wrong with me, when hes the one who made me up set Afterwards he will make fun of me for being a baby and crying over everything, and i shouldnt be acting like a 2 year old anymore",

I am about to be alone again. I of course have not told my girlfriend about these thoughts, not her problem. But like I feel like my life is going to be this cycle of me craving attention and chasing others away. I cant live in this constant cycle. Love isnt worth it, if it always ends in a break up. I have no close friends so I am going to be alone. Like am I just bound to suffer. I dont even think I enjoy cs anymore, but it feels too late to go into music or business. Plus I dont have the contacts for business. My career feels hopeless, my relationships feel hopeless, and being more confident one day feels like a longshot. So here I am thinking to myself, do I end it? Is it worth the continual suffering? Is this relationship hopeless? Will I find friends that I can connect with? Will I become a better person? Will I succeed? I dont know, and at this point, it feels like I should give up.",
    "How do I forgive myself? 7 years ago I met this amazing girl on Instagram when we were both 13. She lived in Ohio and I was from Massachusetts. We talked as friends and grew into a relationship. At the time I knew I wanted her for the rest of my life but I still fell into selfish ways. I would break up with her and talk to other girls. While she just waited cause she was head over heals for me and then wed get back together and that happened countless times.. the final time I broke up with her I really didnt want to. I was taking advice from my dad because some stuff went down and we were going to meet in person again for another summer and wed already been talking for 3 years online. So I asked my dad if I should wait till next summer to finally take the chance? I was angry that we couldnt see each other and I was upset.. wed been planning all year to meet this time and it was ruined because of some stupid stuff she did with her friends.. my dad told me that eventually Id find someone else and I shouldnt waste my youth on one relationship when theres thousands of different chances.. so I broke up with her.. it was one of the hardest parts of her life. She was alone and hurting because I left her again.. I had a itch in the back of my mind that this isnt what you want dont make the same stupid mistakes again, youre in love with her.. a few weeks go by or maybe months and she found someone else. A physical relationship and I just broke. I said some really cruel things to her, very very cruel things.. she told me I want you to hurt like you hurt me and I went ballistic and i said fine you want to see me hurt? And I proceeded to cut my self at least a hundred times on my thighs and repeatedly sending her pictures of what I was doing and she begged me to stop and she cried and she pleaded and I just wouldnt.. years go by shes been in a few relationships and we dont talk.. I find a girl who abused me but I took it because I felt thats what I deserved.. she cheated on me and left me, I was having a breakdown and the girl from Ohio would occasionally check on me.",

    "i had to say goodbye to my sweet boy today after finding out yesterday cancer is ravaging his body. ive never wanted to simply wait in a waiting room longer, but they called us right back. i prayed that the doctor was tied up and would take a while before she got back there, but no sooner did i finish thinking that she came in. i felt myself detach from my body at that point. i cant remember anything she said, but i know from the time she came in the room to the time she left the room was only about five minutes. my babys body was so tired, it had been fighting so hard for so long. he was gone before the injection to stop his heart was even finished. my world and heart suddenly felt so... empty. i was wailing in the vets office, the pain is so deep. the doctor told me our grief is only a reflection of our love, and i believe that 100. i genuinely dont think i could love my boy even an OUNCE more because my little heart would give out. im back home now, my other dogs dont understand why their brother isnt here. i never ever expected my maximus to be the first to go. i have two other senior dogs, and maximus is the youngest. i felt so sure i had at least 34 more years with him, and i feel so robbed. i wasnt remotely prepared, i had zero clue this was coming. the one comfort i have is i dont feel remorse over the amount of time i spent with him. i dont feel like i wish i wouldve sat with him and pet him more because that dog was at my side constantly. any spare second i have im laying with him. anywhere i go, hes the one that gets up in the car and rides with me. he loves a car ride. i always surprise him with a mcdouble, and the excitement he shows never ever ever gets old. im not prepared for all of that to be a fond memory. im scared, because i know in time ill forget how it felt to pet that big block head and i dont ever want to.",

I am sure many people face issues that are much worse than mine, but I dont know what to do anymore other than ask for help. English is not my first language so I apologise for any mistakes. For context I am 24 yo, female, with a stable job and a loving boyfriend. By all means I should be happy right? Well I started feeling more and more depressed a few months ago and so far, it hasnt changed. I dont feel like eating and have lost weight, I dont feel like going out or hanging out with people and I could literally spend my whole day sleeping which I did for the past two days, missing work, I often find myself crying for no reason and I dont enjoy anything anymore. My boyfriend is abroad for a while because of his studies, and so I am able to hide from him most of the time. But its getting harder and harder and I think he is starting to lose patience. Our last two conversations was him telling me that he is sick of me moaning every two days and crying for no reason. This is not the first time I have been depressed, and usually it follows something bad, but this time I feel like its all in my head and its Something that I cant get out of. Its starting to impact my job, my Relationship and everything else in my life... Do any of you have any advice for me? ampx200B Thank you for taking the time to read this post!",

    "How do you pull yourself together when you're not motivated? Hello. I 23F have tried to make a post to explain whats going on with me, but I just end up crying, and everything I write is incoherent, so. Sorry if theres not enough context? Im having a really difficult time right now. I cant really focus on work, and I dont get in as many hours as I should. I feel like I am letting people down. Existing is exhausting, and all I can do is waste time on my phone, because if Im on my phone I dont have to think and time passes more quickly. Im tired of spending hours on my phone instead of doing functionalpeople things, Im just putting everything off and setting myself up for failure. But doing anything productive feels too daunting, and I dont know how to start? I want to develop healthy habits  spend less time on my phone, maybe go outside more often, go on walks, stick to my work schedule, find hobbies. Simple things that I know would improve my mental health. But even though I want those things, I feel like Im not motivated enough to make a change. Its always easier to stay in my comfort zone, to distract myself. My brain says I need to change, but I feel like I dont want it bad enough to actually try. I cant keep living like this, though. Ive tried looking for advice online, but everything I see involves  Therapy, which I dont have money for. Reaching out, but I have very few people Im close with, and I dont feel comfortable talking about my mental health to any of them. Selfhelp books and stuff, which just...does not work on me. Hobbies, but I dont really have any of those anymore? Ive been depressed for so long, Ive lost interest in the ones I used to have as a kid, and never developed new ones.

    "Am I a wuss? So Ive been living with my roommatefriend for like half a year. I think Im a decent enough roommate I clean up after myself, help out, blah blah blah. Anyway I was making dinner for us. She chopped up the pasta sauce ingredients and I made the sauce and pasta. So basically I used too much pasta for the amount of sauce I had. Honest mistake I think tell me if Im wrong please!. She got frustrated and lashes out. Essentially calling into question me as a man and as a cook. bottom line was I got hurt and ended up crying. Now this worries me for a few reasons. The last time I was too sensitive about being insulted was around the time I had a breakdown. Basically it felt like my emotions were sunburned and any little negative comment pushed me over. Also those kinds of things attacking my manhood and pretty much anything negative about me has been a sort of depression mantra when Im upset lots of negative thoughts rolling out at once. My question is this is it possible Im too easily triggered? Or maybe the particular subject matter was a significant trigger? Or maybe am I just a wuss and therefore not much of a man?",

I immediately went and bought some mens deodorant since it tends to be stronger, but I was hoping someone might have a better way for me to combat this.

    "I’m not sure if I have depression, please reply, I made posts to other subreddits and no one answered and it’s making me feel even worse Then in high school I finally made friends. During 10th grade my friend told me that my crush of 6 years called me super ugly and said who would want to date her? That shattered everything. And now I believe that Im so repulsive that I will never find love and I will be lonely forever. Fortunately, I made friends, and one cool thing I do with a group Im really close with is that we have therapy sessions and we talk about our problems and try to cheer each other up. Ive yet to have my session yet, but I accidentally gave away that I hate my body and they think I have body dysmorphia, I think I have it too but I cant say cause I havent been diagnosed. Honestly it made me feel so good that there were people who were concerned about me but that never happened again. They never speak about it like they speak about other friends problems... Thats probably because I havent told them all this, and I wouldve but Im afraid. What if all of this is me being too dramatic. And that what Im feeling isnt serious and they think bad of me. And Im scared to go to a therapist because of that same reason. So I rather keep all these emotions inside, and almost every night I cry because of these problems. Most of the times at night, I feel empty, lifeless. If I close my eyes I imagine Im floating through space lifeless. My thoughts are very dangerous because I keep thinking more negative, and to avoid that I go on my phone and distract myself by doing something. Because of my disease I have to take pills daily, and Ive always thought that I have an easy chance to kill myself by taking a lot of them, but I dont think I would because its a sin in my religion, but maybe one day Im too down that I might do something...

She has money and I really think thats the only reason why hes with her, which is sad. We have stayed in touch mostly by text and he sees our animals we owned together.

    "Im 14 and i already managed to fail my life hi guys, this is my first post on Reddit. I am only 14 years old. Ive been suffering from depression ever since i was 12. I rarely feel happy anymore. Unfortunately these intense feelings have lead me onto a path of constant drug use which only makes my depression worse because I know i am smarter than that. I started smoking weed 2 years ago and obviously things have only gone downhill from then. I am literally mentally and physically addicted to a fucking USB Juul and Ive even found myself robbing weed dealers just because I thought that would make me feel sick but it only made things worse. I have been taking escitalopram since I was 11. Ever since I wet to high school I did a lot of stupid shit and now that I look back at it i purely did those things because of peer approval. These couple of years have literally felt like a lagging game. I havent smoked in a day and I feel like complete shit. Theres probably a lot of things I left out because when i dont smoke for extended periods I feel dumb and slow. I made a Reddit account just to post this so please dont come at me with some bullshit jokes. I feel like ending my life my family is fighting as im writing this. Even typing a paragraph as simple as this feels mentally challenging. In elementary school my teachers would constantly say how smart i was and I would get 80s and 90s without studying and now I feel like because of the effect weed had on my brain I wont be able to find a career later on in life.

    "She keeps rejecting my help. So I 18am in couple with my girlfriend 17 since few month. And she has a depression so I try to help her and when we are together she seems happy, so I try to always do things with her. But every times that we are not together she text me that she is sad and feel very depressed. And this time she went on vacation with her family in an other country. And its been a week that she feels that way the problem is that when she is like this she does literally nothing else except staying in her bed. So she always text me and I call her but when I try to tell her to do stuff or motiv her she keeps getting angry and tells me that I cant understand, so she hang up and ghost me for many hours. Idk what to do cuz I really want to help her and I cant stay and do nothing when I know that my girlfriend is like that.",
    "feeling lost and lonely I have zero friends and its been that way since grade 10 so give or take 4 or 5 years. I had a friend group in my freshman year but I found myself less happy around them and when i went to a new high school i distanced myself from everyone and this is where it all started. Found myself insecure around others and got really uncomfortable out of nowhere. im now 20, never been to a party and have zero friends and when someone tries to be friends with me i think its weird. Ive only had toxic relationships my whole life. Between friendships and a couple relationships. Im a talented, funny, really likeable girl but i dont think i can relax around people and enjoy it at all. tbh i hate it. i dont wanna be like this forever im extremely lonely but this has been a ongoing problem for years and i feel like im experiencing a much deeper mental disorder than i let on. i just dont know what it is. Im EXTREMELY insecure also. Because im alone 247 and never chat with anyone and have no family, my thoughts drive me insane and there SO loud. I have fun by getting drunk alone in my room. My depression has turned physical and ive been experiencing intense chest tightening to the point where it feels like im struggling to breathe and ive been trying to distress and balance it out a bit. I spend hours a day in my room daydreaming and talking to myself. Its what i enjoy now and the most fun i have. I feel disconnected from my surroundings and reality. I just dont know what to do i fear im stuck here forever. Can anyone atleast somewhat relate? What can i do?",
    "Why can't i ask for help? Hi. Im a twenty year old man currently failing university. Well, Im pretty sure Im failing. Ive given late handins for a lot of my projects, not done other projects properly, and not handed in some other projects all together. Whenever I get stressed I dont do anything and I still havent made any friends at uni. To be fair, I do have high school friends, but none of them are interested in the field I want to go into. I feel so alone a lot of the times, I feel useless and I feel dumb. I did go for therapy in the past, it was just for a couple of months after I told my mom I was cutting myself. That ended when my therapist said I didnt need any help. Im sorry, Im babbling. The point of why Im writing this is because I cant seem to ask the people in my life for help. Hell, right now Im swinging back and forth between asking a bunch of internet strangers. But I feel like Im going crazy. Every time I make up my mind to go tell my mom or my sister or my brother about these things, I convince myself out of it. i tell myself that these problems arent that big of a deal, that Id only be disturbing them my sister recently had a baby, so shes spending a lot of her time taking care of him that these problems arent problems and that I just need to get off my stupid lazy ass and do my work. And then i dont ask for help. And now Im starting to think that this post is a dumb idea. This wont actually achieve anything. Im complaining to strangers about problems that arent problems. Im just being stupid. Im sorry.",

    "Self-Improvement help After 2.5 years of living with my girlfriend she left. I dont want to get much into detail but up until some months ago relationship was great, then we started having some minor issues, which bummed me out a little. I never told her about it its no big deal, I cant justify being mad about this little thing... I thought. Of course you can figure that these minor issues only began to grew, pushed us apart and ultimately killed the relationship. When we recently talked about this it was already too late, but upon openly talking about the matter I understood her behaviour much better. Probably, if we had talked about that way sooner we could have saved the relationship. The problem is, it is not the first time I do that. I have had previous relationships die for the same reasons. So here I am once again, depressed because my fear of confrontation killed what was the best relationship, by far, that I have ever had. She was such a great girl and I fucked up everything. I also believe that it was not only lack of communication  confrontation fear. When things were going bad the thought of breaking up was constantly in my head. Again, I never told her about it nor decided to take the step myself. This is probably because I dont have many friends and fear solitude. There are a lot of times already when I feel lonely, especially during the latter months, and I didnt want to make matters worse. However, I am almost sure that having this constant break up thought made me unconsciously sabotage the relationship and be more distant. Of course, talking about this stuff earlier on would have probably helped. I am fed up with this, I know that keeping things to myself and other similar behaviours of mine are only going to keep destroying relationships, but its like I cant help it. As I said this is not the first time this happens to me and would probably not be the last one if I dont force myself to change.",
    "Feeling helpless, stuck, and confused I dont understand why Im so depressed all the time, like I just cant cope with what I have to deal with. Im on multiple medications and Im trying so hard to get a therapist but where I live you need parental consent, and Im not in public school because of my disorders so I cant get a school counsellor, and Im so scared of counselling now because one wrong word, one accidental confession and theyll lock me up in a psych ward again and that was the hardest, most embarrassing, and most traumatic experience Ive ever had, that I now have diagnosed PTSD from it. I just dont understand why Im like this, like I want to be normal and happy and go to school and go out with friends and get a job and a boyfriend and be productive and enjoy life and I try so so so so hard but its never enough, I never feel any better. I feel like Im gonna be like this forever. I just want a normal brain, without any mental illnesses and trauma. This is so debilitating I cant even function on a normal level. Im five steps behind everyone around me. Theyre graduating and I cant get out of bed to do my schoolwork I get from an alternative school, because eventually I have to hand it in and then take a test in an area of complete strangers for the entire day, doing nothing after the test, and sitting there for the rest of the day because no one can pick me up and I have no way to get home until my mom gets off work, 3 hours after the school is closed. The amount of anxiety that situation gives me makes me sick. I want to do it, I want to get my schooling done and graduate but it takes so much to bring me to even have a sliver of confidence to even consider going. Not to mention, my family makes fun of me for it and always makes jokes about Well, thats because your sister actually graduated Not until you graduate Well it gives me anxiety when you dont do your schoolwork Being said by someone who has never experienced even the slightest bit of an anxiety disorder.

Ive had depression on and off for about 10 years now, and I just finally moved out on my own, got a job Im good at but is not what I ever studied or dreamed of doing, and I just feel empty. Like Id rather be laying in bed today than be at work. So is this gonna be the rest of my life? Im on antidepressants but I dunno. Just doesnt seem like things matter. I dont really wanna be in a 95 from January to December for the rest of forever. And I mean I enjoy video games and movies still but its just killing time I feel like. Is there anything I can do?",
    "I just realized I'm very depressed but I don't know why. Before today, I didnt even know or even seriously consider that I may be depressed. To me it just seemed normal, and probably due to the gradual increase of the severity I simply didnt connect the dots. From what I can recall its been going on since I was around 12, back in 2014. First I remember becoming quite lazy and finding getting anything done an incredibly hard challenge. I thought it was just because I was a teenager, and lazyness is a normal teenager status. Then I started having a lot of anger issues, Id get pissed off for the most minute things, I had an incredibly short fuse but I just thought it was also normal teenager behavior. Eventually I managed to suppress those explosions so theyd go off in my head but no one would notice. I started to lose interest in things I used to enjoy a lot, like math, and went from reading 30 books a year to reading 0 last year. I think I was around 15 when the first suicidal thought occurred. Every time Id fuck up and get grounded or yelled at, or faced consequences for my actions Id just think over and over again that I wasnt worth anything. Those thoughts disappeared for some time, but arose back last year. I, again, thought it was normal. I think the reason they stopped is because I was at a relative high in my life, I had entered college at 16 years of age and everyone I knew was proud of me, and I felt good about myself. Or so I think I thought. I feel like I can speak for any teenager out there that mastubating is normal. Yet Im not sure when, it became a daily thing, and then 2 or 3 times per day. Also I stopped showering, I dont even know why. I just didnt. Id go into the bathroom, turn on the water and just sit on the toilet looking at it or my phone. I stopped cleaning my room and then stopped washing my clothes. Id wait till the last pair of underwear, maybe reuse it a few times and then wash enough clothes for a week, while months of clothes were piled up. My dandruff got much worse, and the suicidal thoughts came back every once in a while.",

For context Im 24 and smoke about 6 cigarettes a day, which is why I feel extra shitty because I feel like Ive ruined my teeth forever. Yes I know quitting smoking will help, but Im trying to undo bad habits one at a time and start to take better care of myself, and quitting smoking and dealing with mental health problems is really fucking hard.

    "19 years old and its pretty obvious there's no reason to go any further Id rather live in the wild foraging for food like a monkey over working my ass off for hours a day just for money green paper that people think is so good and meaningful I just dont understand. It feels like I was born on the wrong planet or the wrong time and to make it all worse no matter how long I sit and logically think about it I cannot think of way out of this hell other than suicide, just selling my timelife away as a slave, or just being homeless. And to top it all off when I was 13 or 14 my hair started thinning and during high school with my thin hair everyone Including every single person close to me even teachers started making fun of me saying things like crackhead or you look like an old man, you look like a hobo, Looks like Albert Einstein, Do you wash your hair? and while it sounds hilarious from an outside perspective eventually after hearing dozens of different people say this constantly my entire juniorsenior year it has really dragged me through hell and back just trying to keep myself from going completely insane and it caused me to completely lose any self confidence I once had. All that I really want is a female to love me and a place of my own to stay at without having to owe other people anything. Just me and a lover free to be ourselves to do what we want, live how we want but theres always someone else who thinks its in their place for you to owe them money and money is whats completely ruined my idea of a happy life. Its literally unfair for someone else to tell me how to live but the government thinks they can tell people weed is illegal to possess yet thats fake as fuck like nothing is illegal if it was then some nonhuman force would seek redemption for me possessing weed but no, its other people telling ME that Ill be punished by other human beings if I have weed by throwing me in a cage for doing something of my own consent. or insert anything illegal that I choose to have in my life Does the government have consent of MY BODY? Yes they do if they can throw me in a cage for ingesting something of my choosing. Is living as a truly independent human just completely impossible? To live without being under someone elses rule?",
    "Everyone ghosting after some time Hey, eh, life is shit. Whenever it goes good, in next few days sth shit happens. Now I dont want to even have good moments, because after them there are 2x more worse. Last few months I lost my job, ended weirdest relationship ever which I still miss, suspicion of stomach cancer. Everything at 21y old. Besides that my parents literally hate me and only few friends stayed with me, rest faded out because I wasnt going to drink vodkaalcohol almost everyday. And the worst part of last monthsyears are new peoole who I meet. Most of them were really cool, always said they will never ghost but after some time they were doing same shit, which fucking hurts when you get to know someone close. Now I feel like fucking shit, being on knees in front of toilet, vomiting blood, not having energy to go out, when few months ago I wanted to start marathon. Only positive side of last months is reducing amount of drugs throwing cigs, max few beers per month etc. And also withdrawing from being addicted to halcion. Now Im also really scared about university, because there wont be online lessons, but normal. And in current state its hard to go up from bed, not talking about living as normal student. Nothing on Earth basically makes me happy now, Im just living because Im too scared to end this? So I just let the life pass. But I will probably not live much longer naturally so. Even my psychologist postponed my visit over 2 weeks in currently worst part of my life.

    "\"Paying for happiness\" - anyone else? It is as if my body and mind HAVE to revert back to a depressive norm, like a rubber band snapping back the higher I stray from it, the more intense the snapback. This is devastating, even as I have recognized the pattern and come to expect it. It literally feels like I am punished by my own bodymind for daring to experience happiness or joy. It feels like a cruel trick by the Universe every time, or like I have to pay the piper for not feeling depressed for one damn day. I have considered the possibility of bipolar disorder, but I really dont think thats it. Certainly yoyoing between joy and depression has that weird polarity, but the happiness is always caused by externals  a trip somewhere, quality time with friends, a great experience, etc. It doesnt just come out of nowhere. I really have to find and create the happiness. It is the punishment that has no rhyme or reason aside from following the pattern. It is inevitable even if nothing bad happens to bring me down  its just a crash, like a plane running out of fuel and dropping out of the sky. And while the happiness can feel euphoric sometimes, it doesnt feel like any kind of manic episode Ive heard or read about. It is more just the joy of feeling some goddamn unvarnished happiness for a little while. Does anyone else experience this? Any suggestions? !",

I can feel emotions. When Im with friends and family or watch a funny video I laugh and smile, but it just feels empty? Lifeless? Like on a scale of 110 10 being the happiest I know I should be feeling a 10 and in general the situation is a 10 but for some reason I cant seem to get past a 5 at most. Its like my brain is saying this is funny you should laugh and feel happy but I just dont feel that? At least not fully. Its like my 5 is other peoples 10s, both are fully happy just one is less than the other. When other people are laughing so much theyre in tears and cant catch their breath Im only chuckling, even though I know the situation is funny. I cant even remember a time where I laughed so much I was in tears. When I laugh it almost feels like a chore or an automatic response that I could just as easily not do. This is hard to explain but when I laugh and smile its like im not physically feeling it. What I imagine true happiness to feel like is a warmness, something you can physically feel in your body, but when I smilelaugh the outside physically changes but inside I dont feel anything. It almost feels as if Im acting but Im not because I do know the situation is funny. Its like theres a disconnect somewhere. Its hard to explain. And this is just one emotion, I feel this with everything. The only emotions I seem to be able to feel the strongest are annoyanceanger and sadness, but even thats toned down, not saturated, lifeless.",
    "Do you ever feel guilty for not doing enough to treat your depression? How do you deal with it? I keep falling into this terrible spiral of thoughts like well, you would feel less depressed if only youd exercise, eat healthy and keep the house clean, but of course, living with depression means I rarely have the energy to do all or any of those things. And the more I kick myself, the more energy I lose, so I sit in bed, eat cookies and let messes pile up around me, which in turn makes me more depressed, and so on.... Im on medication and in therapy, both of which help, but I get so down on myself for not being able to form better habits. I know I need to start small and to go easy on myself, but even then its a struggle. At the moment Im more focused on how to deal with the guilt of not doing things, as opposed to strategies for accomplishing said things.

    "This is a cry for help... I spent the next 8 months completely depressed. I can describe my mood like instead of blood, some sort of black ink was being pumped into my vessels. I spent nights crying and punching the wall. I moved to another town for college. Dated 3 more girls but I couldnt love them and I still wanted that specific girl. I dropped out of college and moved back to my hometown to my family to start studying for the big test again and get accepted in a university. How did that happen? 8 months after my breakup, While I was spending my days and nights depressed as fuck, I saw something on Instagram. A girl from my hometown whom I had a crush on for a year followed me on Instagram. I saw her post and stories to know her better, and she was EXACTLY my type. Her taste in music, her beliefs atheist and her style and her face. She was kinda the one. As Persian names are not familiar to you, I refer to her as Jane. And, I refer to myself Jack. I started talking to her on Instagram, and we hit it off. I reached one of my girlfriends who knew her. And asked her if Jane is single. She said she got back together with one of her ex boyfriends, and that guy is a fucking douche. He had convinced Jane that their breakup was her fault and she needed to grew up. Jane is also 19, and the guy was 20. That guy was driving Jane crazy. He disrespected her in every possible way and didnt care. I saw that as a great opportunity that when they breakup again, I can date her and treat her the way she deserved to be treated. So I waited. But the next day, that friend told me that Jane asked her did Jack say anything about me to you? She said no, but told her that a long time ago she heard from one of her friends that Jack is into Jane. She told me that the moment she told that to Jane, Jane got very happy and excited, and told her that she has a crush on me too. I couldnt believe what I heard. I wanted her but she was into me too?",

    "I can’t take it anymore Hi guys, I feel like I cant take it anymore. Im 15 years old and in grade 11, I go to an all boys catholic school, which predominantly contains white students. Throughout my whole life my parents have had a extremely bad relationship. When I was born my dad bailed on my mum, brother and me only to come back after she begged him. My dad currently cheats on my Mum and has been doing it as for as long as Ive been alive. My mum is dyslexic and works very long hours, I generally only see her for about 3 hours a day. My parents hate each other and havent spoken to each other in over a year, putting me in between all their bullshit. Ever since I started highschool I was getting bullied, it started out with name calling and me being him stopped for a while and they about 6 people started hitting me together. I told two of the housemasters at my school and nothing happened. This continued and I had a panic attack at school where I spoke another teacher about the bullying and nothing happened. Last year a large amount of the bullying stopped and my life seemed to get a bit better. This year two people have been going at me every chance they can. They taken it to the point where they have created instagram accounts of me where they create memes and just mock me it has been going on for about 3 months, I only found out recently after one of my friends showed me.

    "Should I get myself checked in to a psychiatric ward so they can force me to start my antidepressant? The more scared I get the worse my anxiety gets. The worse my anxiety gets the more I get scared, and it gets even harder to start my medicine. Lately I havent been able to think about anything else other than my bowel issues, I cant even watch a youtube video. Im not suicidal I have suicidal thoughts yes but I havent made any plans, and I have things I want to do, you know? I dropped out of college, and I want to go back. Im not even exaggerating when I say this I see myself going back to school literally every night in my dreams. I have gender dysphoria, and I want to at least know how it feels like to be comfortable in your own body. And these things keep me going. But I also know that I have to take my medicine, and I just dont know how I can do that. I thought of a couple things that I can try. First, I can get myself checked in to a psychiatric ward. Make them force me to take my medicine. There are several upsides and downsides with that. If I get an anxiety attack they can intervene. I will be forced to take the medicine, so it has a higher probability of success. But on the other hand, the psychiatric wards in my country have some problems. Ive read a lot about human rights violations, abuse, mistreatment, violence etc. And Im sure you can understand, I dont need this stuff on top of my problems. Also since Im not a danger to myself or to others they might not even accept me. Also my parents will probably be very angry with me, because I dont look very nervous or stressed from outside. Second, find a way to start taking them on my own. I can ask to start from a lower dose. My psych wanted me to start at 150mg. Effexor XR is available with dosages as low as 37.5mg. I can ask for anti anxiety medication. I have anti nausea medication, and I can take that while starting.",

Theres been several shootings, drug dealers, our car windows were shot out last summer. So I was counting on this promotion to get my family out! So Im feeling down and overwhelmed all at once between not getting the promotion, tending to have seasonal depression anyways, struggling with buying Christmas, and my sons birthday also being in December. My boss said theyd have something for me soon.. Im afraid to get my hopes up again. I feel like my performance that got me even considered for the position is lacking because I am down and no longer have the positive feeling I had.",
    "Eating. (Tw) I can barely eat 2 meals a day anymore. Today I had nothing for breakfast, a cookie for lunch and a few slices of pizza and a few chips for dinner. My family keep putting food infront of me but I always say Im not hungry. I cant tell Im loosing weight but apparently my family can. I cant help it. I exercise for hours a day and eat little food. I feel like fainting alot of the time. But I dont want people to find out I havent been eating so I eat tiny amounts, and then continue on. I drink tea to get me through the day. Im constantly tired, cold and angry all the time. I dont know whats happening to me. A few months ago I would look at people who said they mentally couldnt eat and say they were stupid, but now Im the person I called stupid. I guess it started when I found out I was transgender. I started working out because I hated my body. As time went on, I started to work out more. And as more time went on I started to eat less and less. Help me. I cant stand it. But I cant stop. No matter how much I want to eat and be healthy. I cant. My mind wont let me.",
    "Feeling alone I have reached a point where I need a lot of support but I feel like such a burden. I work remotely and independently. My school program is online. Despite living with family, I spend most of the time home alone because of different schedules and conflict between people. I try to reach out to friends, but theyre all busy living their life. I dont really have anyone I feel that I can call when things get really bad. Even when I do talk,my friends say that everyone gets lonely and that Ill be okay but I feel like Im going crazy. And lately Im just tired. I think about ending things everyday. Im tired",
    "Sigh so...frustrated. and Angry since yesterday night Sigh so...frustrated. and Angry since yesterday night. My nutbar Aunt and her husband were in town. She wanted to treatme to rise of skywalker. Me being me said coolness! at first but decided better part of something to say...except Ive seen it before and it was meh. Would love to go see Jumanji next level which lead her it felt like to start over thinkinking. Whats that movie? Whos the Rock? Oh Him!... Theres two? I thought they made only one? Something about video game esk movies being a product for addhd melenials with apreciation for the art of a good movie. Even though she loves the original StarWars...and how about this depressing movie instead? no Gosh youre such a pill! I guess I made the mistake of comenting how I just like sometypes of movies but not others. I like uplifting ones, and also like funny ones. Just didnt want to see Knives out, or a nature documentarywhich did look excelent, just not in the mood to see it. That lead to fun drama. about being picky ? ??? and now its made things hard for her to treat me to movies and gosh she thought itd be fun etc. But as a back up plan she happened to have some cardgames. Meenwhile Oh. My. God. Both my parents and her taking turns tag teaming how really need to get off cymbalta because its becoming netorius for adding weight. and how my therapist is so evil, and by the way so is big pharma. Dad being him wanted to rant loudly about 45, with Aunts husband. Probably because at christmas, I had enough of him ranting about tech and civillians his insult for novice users. and how 45 is so great for at least doing something. And I had bluntly changed topics, only for him to talk even louder. His way of being passive aggressive.",
    "Yesterday Was Rough To catch you up Ive dealt with depression, anxiety, and parasuicidal thoughts for over 30 years, since before I was 10. My wife and I are currently separated as we both deal with our individual issues with depression, anxiety, etc, as well as seek couples counseling. We have been married 8 years, together 10, and have a 2 12 year old son. ampx200B Last Friday, I was given an ultimatum at work. I am the director of advertising amp marketing for one of the largest independent automotive groups in the Southeast United States. I was told, in so many words, that I had a week to prove my worth or lose my job. Never mind that I have reduced our spending by 45 since I started, and brought in triple my salary in additional new business due to digital marketing efforts I implemented in the organization, all the while maintaining the original sales output of our business. I was given exactly zero direction as to how to prove my worth. Needless to say, the last week has only served to heighten my stress and anxiety. ampx200B Ive never been a very physically affectionate person. I get that from my mom, a survivor of sexual abuse when she was a child. But yesterday, I really needed a hug from my wife. I just wanted to hold her in my arms, breathe in her scent, and feel like everything was going to be alright. ampx200B I realize, cognitively, that this process is a good thing for our lives. We are on the road to personal healing and healing as a couple. But that doesnt make this season any easier, and a hug from my little boy doesnt do for me what one from my wife would.",
    "Woke up at 10am but couldn’t get out of bed until 2:30 pm because I am always so exhausted in the mornings I dont know whats causing it. Im just absolutely exhausted in the mornings to the point where it feels impossible to get out of bed. I dont even feel like picking up my phone or moving a muscle at all. I just lie there for hours on end. Maybe its related to depression and the fact that Im doing nothing useful at all right now Im at uni but Im already months behind and Im going to fail my first year at this rate so Ive nothing to strive towards each day but I really have no idea. What should I do? ?",
    "My GF is suffering with depression and I don't know how to help Ive told her Im here for her but shes very distant now. I dont wanna suffocate her with love amp support cause she said it makes her anxious so do I just let her be distant for a while? She has also brought up every mistake Ive done in our relationship and wanted to break up with me because Im not perfect. Ive dated her for years this isnt the first depressive episode last time I did leave since she was already moving on with someone else. But this time there is no one else we were talking about marriage before she went into this depressive state. Usually it doesnt get this bad like shed feel better in a week or two or shed at least talk to me. This time shes barely talking to me. I want to help her but I dont know how and now Im starting to wonder if shes depressed because of me.",
    "I have no one. Living in my own for the first time. And I have no one to talk to. I just want some comfort. Ive been alone for a month and a half. Ive cried a lot lately which isnt normal of me and not a lot has made me smile. Im not suicidal at all. But I just want someone to hold me you know? Sorry if this is too much to read. I doubt anyone will see it either. But hopefully someone does. I could use some help. Requesting Support, Story, and Rant tags... Sadly I cant do them all",
    "Chronic Depression and Work Performance Hello. I need someones thoughts or advice. I have several diagnosed illnesses, persistent grieving disorder and pdd with frequent mdes, so thanks brain for the double depression . I am unmedicaded In that past couple months after a huge mde I never quite made it completely out and have been progressively doing worse to a point where my work performance is suffering, Ive received a couple of warnings to get my sh t together not in those exact words but close. Ive never been in such a position where my work ability has lacked because of this. Like I genuinely feel like Im going to either get fired sooner or later or suddenly quit, because of my mental state. I am going to discuss with my psychiatrist medication. We had talked about it before but they basically said we could talk more in detail when I was ready. But a part of me has been considering temporary disability to basically be able to figure myself out, figure out the right meds if necessary, right dosage, etc before putting myself out there to work. I feel so heavy everytime I get ready for the day like what am I going to mess up today and its making everything so much worse. My work frustration is literally dragging me down harder. Im so frustrated with myself and Im so tired of feeling like this all the time. What has everyone here done at work? Has anyone felt like they cant properly perform due to their illness? If so, what have you done about it? What has helped you work wise?",
    "Things just keep getting worse On the background check it says I was sentenced to jail  I wasnt, but might even been for failure to pay the fines. There may be warrants out for my arrest for failure to pay the fines, I dont know. They still havent told me what additional information they need, but I dont really think it could be anything but that. I feel like my mistakes and being poor the past few years are going to prevent me from ever getting a job and making things better. Ive made mistakes, Ive paid for them, Ive learned from them. But I just havent been able to pay the fines. Even if they decide to give me the job, I have doubts theyll have me start next Monday since people will be off for Thanksgiving. So I wouldnt even start working til Dec. and wouldnt get a paycheck until Dec. 15. And this job is remote and I cant work from home once the power is cut off. I dont have anybody I can ask for any type of help. And Im really feeling pretty hopeless right now. Its literally taken me years to get this 1 job offer and its looking like it isnt going to happen. I just dont see how things can get better when it looks like things are definitely going to get worse. I could use the public WiFi somewhere like the library, but I dont know how I could do that while being on Zoom calls for most of the day. Even with a headset Id still be bothering others when Im talking. If youve got a better idea of what I could do for a few weeks, please let me know. I would LOVE to have a good job, get caught up on rent and utility bills, pay my fines and get on with having a life. Im just so frustrated and discouraged and depressed right now.",
    "My family don’t believe in depression My family are those kinds of people who yell and scream no matter what, the constant name calling ect. Im the eldest of three and always seem to be the main target, my father always seems to bully me, I have olive coloured skin and that is always the topic of bullying racist remarks, my brother is constantly screaming at me calling me a fat c u n t and so on and so forth, my youngest sister now tells me to die and to kill myself, Ive developed thick skin yet these comments hurt more and more. How do I explain to them that I am depressed, I have anxiety I dont communicate well with people because of the environment I was brought up in, my doctors have put me on medication for this they just dont believe me",
    "I need help finding coping mechanisms TW suicide For most of my life, id always been extremely suicidal. I wont go into detail about my life but it sucks and heavily contributed to me having depression and being suicidal since before I even became a teenager. A couple years ago, I had a failed suicide attempt and thanks to the help of some people I managed to actually develop a will to live and I finally got rid of the suicidal part, but Im still struggling with the depression part. When I was suicidal, it was really easy for me to handle mental breakdowns by just telling myself Its fine. Ill just kill myself, I dont have to worry about the future that much. If things get as bad as Im fearing theyre about to, I have an easy way out. Now, whenever I have mental breakdowns I default to saying the same thing but then I start thinking Fuck. I dont want to die, I cant just kill myself. Theres no way out of this. and my mental breakdown continues and gets worse. Im really struggling with handling mental breakdowns. Even when I try to distract myself, either I fail to be distracted and keep overthinking, or it just pushes the breakdown further down the line and the moment I stop being distracted I fall back into the breakdown. Im trying to stay away from substance abuse. It works, but I want to stay healthy and I have personal experience with the dangers of substance abuse. Ive tried depression medication before but none of them really helped me much. Im considering therapy, but Im too anxious that revealing I used to be suicidal might make them worry Im currently suicidal and result in a psych ward situation. I dont know what to do anymore to cope, google doesnt really help, its hard. A clarification just in case, Im seriously not suicidal. I will not be killing myself. I dont need people spamming the comments telling me why I should stay alive, I just need help finding coping mechanisms please.",
    "I absolutely despise myself. How do I not? Im terrible at everything I try. Everything I want to be good at I fuck up. I can barely cope with my fantastic job. I have absolutely no luck with women and am incredibly, insanely lonely as a result. I cant do anything I want to do because I know it wont be good enough. How do I 30M not feel this way? How do I not compare myself to others? How do I be good at things that I want to be good at? How do I not hate myself? This is all Ive ever known.",
    "Feeling trapped.. I feel like Im losing what bit of control I had, and its really beginning to show since Ive become unable to work in the last few weeks because of my epilepsy... Im starting to become more paranoid, Im hearing things, I wake up thinking someone is in my apartment, Im losing weight, I cant make myself get out of bed or make a phone call. Its only been a year since I was diagnosed with epilepsy and I think I seriously underestimated how much it was going to hurt my already not excellent mental health. I was hospitalized for a suicide attempt in Sept 2018, and was diagnosed with epilepsy in Oct 2018. I do my best to maintain myself, but things have been really tough. As things increase in stress, Im getting closer to a huge episode and its freaking me out. I dont know what to do with myself. My mom sent me some bullshit audiobook about selfhelp CBT, but any of my halfassed attempts to listen just wear me out or make me frustrated. I nearly threw my phone at a wall because it kept crashing when I was trying to install a self help app. Im lost. I find myself rejecting any opportunity to get help. I dont know what to do.",
    "Skipped school to kill myself, didn't go through with it, what now? Please help me, anyone. Hopefully this all makes sense, confused and tired right now, and Im going to not go through and reread anything like I usually do as I know I would probably just end up deleting this post, so hopefully this isnt too confusing. Itll also be long probably, sorry for the long read, but I need to at least get down all of what happened. Just need some advicesupport, or whatever please, Im not really sure what I need, like I said, Im not in the best state of mind currently. ampx200B Ive skipped school maybe 56 times this year when things were too much, as school is one of my biggest stressors and I dont even see the point sometimes, just to get a mental break. Ive never done much on those days other than lie around, or maybe play some video games if I felt like it. These were the worst days for me, constant suicidal thoughts since my parents and brotherssister wouldnt be home, either at school or work. These are the days that I kept toying with the idea, feeling safe in a weird way, I know that I could kill myself if I needed to. I havent skipped for about a month or so, but all throughout yesterday I was thinking as I get closer and closer to graduation, theres a time limit of sorts on when Im actually going to go through with it, as it gets closer and closer I feel more pressure that I have to do it, because I feel like I need to kill myself before I graduate high school, Im not sure why. Today I woke up at 630, and as soon as I got up I was already battling with the idea of whether or not to go to school, and this thought stayed with me throughout breakfast, throughout my shower. I told my brother, who I normally walk to school with, that my alarm woke me up late and that hed better walk to school ahead of me if he didnt want to be late, so he left. I literally did nothing for the next 30 minutes to an hour, literally felt nothing, just thinking about what I was going to do.",
    "Years of worsening chronic fatigue/fog continue to cripple my life Caffeine in any form doesnt help either. Ive seen 3 different psychologists, all of whom were baffled and said they did not know how to help me and have never heard of this before relative to mental health issues. I feel this intense dissociation feeling 247 that has gradually emergedworsened over the past couple of years. Like Im so tired, I dont even feel like Im in real life ever anymore. I feel drunkdrugged, especially as the day progresses. Come 8 PM, I feel so spaced out, the fatigue is unbearable. Sometimes, I feel so tired I feel physically ill. The gradual cognitive decline is shocking Concentration, alertness, memory, focus, processingrecallingstumbling over words and sentences, confusion, etc.. My motor skills have also declined badly as well. I bump into things, my reflexes are awful, I miss things when I try and grab them, etc. I feel dizzylightheaded when I stand up after sitting or laying down. I now have very low arousal. Its almost impossible to startle me. Its like my body doesnt even process loud noises or scare anymore. I feel anxiousstressedoverwhelmed more easily. Everything feels like a chore, like an ordeal I get to check off. Even if it is something extremely minor or something fun. Decision making is poor, even for relatively minor things. Hypersomnia Usually fall asleep very easily, rarely have insomnia. Vision has declined eye floaters, spots, light sensitivity. Eyes are drywatery off and on. Numbness all over body. Tough to explain, but extremitiesbody parts feel so utterly exhausted and numblike to the touch. Like I can feel my arm getting touched by my hand, but cant feel my hand touching my arm. Senses feel dulled Hearing, taste, smell, touch all feel weakened and suppressed, especially as the day goes on and I feel more tired. Sex drive is virtually nonexistent. Alcohol hits me much harder now. As a result, I feel intoxicated more easilyquickly.",
    "I feel like a terrible person Okay so recently my mom went on Facebook and said she was going to kill herself, she then went one and blamed two of my sisters and I. People at my school saw it and now everyone knows Im the reason my mom wants to die. Thats not why Im mad however, Im mad because I have a 10 year old little sister that she was just going to leave, and even though I dont talk to my mom everyday Im still hurt that she was just going to leave me. I feel so guilty that Im mad at her because I also struggle with mental health and Ive been there before, and Ive felt what she feels but Im still SO angry at her. Shes never been the best mom, shes hurt me in the past so many times and this whole thing makes me want to cut her off for good, and even though shes hurt me so many times I know me wanting to just leave will hurt her, so Im trapped. Please people of reddit, what should I do? And am I a terrible person for being mad at her?",
    "Am I a disappointment?? So, Ive been on tinder for some time now. I have match with several girls and had a conversation with only 2. Each one Ive talked, it seemed like that they might have an interest in me, but that may be the desperation in me since Ive never had a date or girlfriend in my 21 years of existence. After some time passes, they both just completely stop talking to me like I dont exist. I feel like once they stop talking to me, they think Im just another random person. All I want is one girl to date and do stuff with. Im not trying to get into their pants. I personally think that Im a huge disappointment, even tho I have a lot of potential in life.",
