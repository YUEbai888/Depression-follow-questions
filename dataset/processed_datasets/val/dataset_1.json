    "(just turned 18) about to be homeless. i’m so scared. please help me due to being depressedsuicidal for the past year, my grades have slipped and I am now academically dismissed from my college. This is completely my fault and I am so angry at myself. I live with my asian family and once they find out, I know that theyll beat me up and kick me out of the house. I am so scared. I have no family or friends to ask for help and I just dont know what to do. Im losing hope",
    "I ( 26 female ) have decided to take care of my severely depressed younger brother (20m ) by letting him move in with me last week and need some tips. I booked him an appointment with a family doctor on Friday  tomorrow  and I spoke to my own therapist who recommended me a program to recommend to the doctor for my brother. They do a more intensive followup for mental health adults that lasts 2 years and they work at the patient s pace... My fear is he will give up or not accept the help even though he told me he is open to it last Sunday. Yesterday he started getting hesitant again saying he didnt want to do the work but also he is aware he needs to get better.. What my concerns are  1. Basically I know that I have what it takes to help him and objectively he is better off with me that he is with my parents and since he has nowhere else to go I wont let him starve or end up on the steet. But, I want to know how to get past my own emotions and fears and anxieties regarding this entire situation and NOT identify with his depression. 2. I want to set healthy boundaries also where I dont get caught up in saving him because I already feel like Im trying to do that... but I dont know what that would look like... should I give him a contract or make him sign a promise to himself  what do I do if after a year he has not progressed ? Should there be consequences  not punishments but, a different recommendation ? I dont want to end up taking care of.him forever I want him to heal with me and get back on his feet. 3. Moreover, I dont want his depression to trigger me and I dont want his negativity  not shaming him he is just very depressed and sick and needs help but his depression makes him so negative about everything  to bring me down, I want to keep pushing for a better life for myself and my brother without the negativty bringing me down as I worked so hard to get to a somewhat surface level healthy mindset  I say this because I.myself can get easily triggered and spiral if things feel to overwhelming especially when it comes to my family  ...",
    "Feeling all over the place. My mood is going back and forth and around and around. I can't get a grip and feel crazy. Im no longer depressed all of the time as Ive figured out many things that can help me out of the stupor. Sometimes I feel so happy that Im about to burst but that doesnt feel like happiness at all and when I come down I think back on the things I said and sure enough find new reasons to want to be depressed. And the depression I feel is worse than its ever been and stays there until I catapult into the stars, which is a place where its hard to relate to anyone. So in both states I feel alone. In short, Im exhausted.",
    "Advice on personal hygiene/self care Hi everyone! This is my first post on reddit so please forgive me if I dont do this right p Ive struggled with severe depression for about 12 years or so now, and lately it seems to be getting worse. Its gotten to a point where I dont have motivation to do the most basic of things  such as showering daily, brushing my hair, even brushing my teeth... its incredibly embarrassing, but I just cant find it in myself to care. I used to put a lot of effort into my appearance, and I took pride in how I presented myself. Now though, I feel as if its pointless. I feel like the way I present myself currently is an accurate portrayal of how I feel inside. Does anyone have any advice on how to change this, or how to find motivation, or anything at all? Id greatly appreciate any ideas on how I could improve on this. I feel ashamed when I show up to work in the same outfit, or with my hair in a tangled bun because I couldnt be bothered to brush it. Not ashamed enough to change though, I guess. Thank you in advance for any responses, and thank you for taking the time to read this",
    "how do i stop hating myself i hate living because i know in a few years ill look back on me and think wow she was so dumb and its discouraging because i know whatever i do currently i will eventually hate. people say cringing at your old self is a sign of personal growth  but that feels so untrue and it ruins my life my grandpa is dying and it hurts me to know in a few years ill look back on my life at this time and hate the way i handled things. i will hate myself in the last few months with my grandpa. i want to stop this. it makes my depression worse and its so annoying",
    "How do you pull yourself together when you're not motivated? Hello. I 23F have tried to make a post to explain whats going on with me, but I just end up crying, and everything I write is incoherent, so. Sorry if theres not enough context? Im having a really difficult time right now. I cant really focus on work, and I dont get in as many hours as I should. I feel like I am letting people down. Existing is exhausting, and all I can do is waste time on my phone, because if Im on my phone I dont have to think and time passes more quickly. Im tired of spending hours on my phone instead of doing functionalpeople things, Im just putting everything off and setting myself up for failure. But doing anything productive feels too daunting, and I dont know how to start? I want to develop healthy habits  spend less time on my phone, maybe go outside more often, go on walks, stick to my work schedule, find hobbies. Simple things that I know would improve my mental health. But even though I want those things, I feel like Im not motivated enough to make a change. Its always easier to stay in my comfort zone, to distract myself. My brain says I need to change, but I feel like I dont want it bad enough to actually try. I cant keep living like this, though. Ive tried looking for advice online, but everything I see involves  Therapy, which I dont have money for. Reaching out, but I have very few people Im close with, and I dont feel comfortable talking about my mental health to any of them. Selfhelp books and stuff, which just...does not work on me. Hobbies, but I dont really have any of those anymore? Ive been depressed for so long, Ive lost interest in the ones I used to have as a kid, and never developed new ones. So I guess Im wonderinghoping you all might have some advice on how to get a bit better, something that doesnt involve the things I just mentioned ? I dont know. I wish wanting to get better was enough to spur me into action.",
    "Depressed firefighter ends things My 30 f ex boyfriend 34 ended things from depression at the beginning of the shut down from covid. He told me he didnt love me anymore almost 3 weeks ago. I dont know if this is how he really feels or if its the depression closing him off to feeling anything. I havent spoken to him since he told me. But I go back and read older messages leading up to the break up and I see him telling me hes struggling with the depression but he tells me how happy I make him and how much he loves me and I keep him afloat. But once he hit a really bad rough patch he closed me out completely. Has anyone experienced this before from my position or even from his that could give me some insight of how their stories progressed with their loved ones as the depression lastedor while you or they got help? I believe in my heart he does love me and the depression suppressed those feelings. You dont just have those feelings disappear from a happy relationship without some type of issue going on. Ive been dying to reach out to him but I was the one that said I needed to heal, but with the riots going on and him being a firefighter and his mother telling me he said the therapist is getting him to open up I want to reach out so bad. Can yall share your stories and give me any insight on his possible feelings or what people did in my own personal shoes? He is the love of my life and losing him has been the hardest thing Ive ever experienced. He also has never dealt with depression before so its entirely new for him. Thank you for anyone and everyone that can help or atleast share their own experiences.",
    "Stuck between moving forward and killing myself Then for Christmas, I sent her a simple card, but never got a response nor did I expect one to be honest. At this point I have accepted she wont talk to me, that she will not come back to me and probably will never do so. However, I cannot accept never getting a chance with her again. In MarchApril she is leaving the country and I fear I will never see or talk to her again in person. All I need is to talk with her and some understanding. Though I know I have messed things up so bad. I have put so much stress on her. I have done everything wrong while I knew better, but still I did it. So far I have been diagnosed with MDD and Persistent Depressive Disorder PDDso a double depression, and they said I show signs of anxiety, bipolar disorder, and a personality disorder e.g. avoidant, dependent, antisocial, existential OCD. I am still at the early stages so I wont have a definitive diagnosis for a quite some time still. What is certain is that there is something really wrong with me. Most of it originates from my horrible childhood and upbringing. Only the MDD was actually caused by the breakup. Still, my ex thinks she and the breakup are the main causes of my current state, but that is simply not true. Of course, I cannot tell her as she wont speak to me nor believe me. ampx200B Now here is my dilemma I feel the pressure to move forward with my life. I feel like I have to take on all these life responsibilities again that I have to live my life to the fullest. I always felt like that, but because I keep overthinking everything I become this passive person who does only the minimum. I feel incredibly weak, pathetic, and scared to do almost anything, like a little kid in grown mans body. Even though I know I can do some things well, I just do not have any solid confidence. If I do nothing then my life wont get better and I will for sure never get back with my ex. Though I dont see the point of putting in all this effort to do things if it doesnt make me happy.",
    "Lost I was diagnosed with cancer around June 2020 I finished treatment some months ago . During that time I realized my friends were t my friends. Because of the treatment Ive become addicted to opiates. I lost the woman I thought I would spend the rest of my life with. Everyday I wake up these things are on my mind with no way out no matter how high I get or what I try . Sometimes it just feels like suicide is the only way out but I know it would devastate my mother. I just would like to feel normal for a change have friends go out live a normal life",
    "I’ve been defeated by everything Im treated like shit by the friends I have, literally people I dont even know will treat me like shit and give me a youre not good looking enough or cool to be talking to me attitude if I try to interact with anybody, and Im the most socially awkward person I or any other person I know has ever seen. I have no one to help me either because my parents get mad at me for showing and signs of distress. My dad does will ignore me and give me the silent treatment and give me angry eyes if I ever tell my parents Im depressed. My mom will start screaming at me about how me being depressed makes her stressed out and how I dont even try to make friends but I do. Shell give me suggestions on how to make friends but Ive tried literally every single one shes given me, and when I tell her that Im simply suffering from a lack of social skills shell scream about how its actually that I look like a freak and a weirdo and that no one would ever want to approach me anyway. And its not like Im a bad son, Im actually better than most teenagers because I have straight As and because I have no supportive friend group that would invite me to things I dont drink or do drugs or have sex. I genuinely feel like the society around me has gone insane at least the place I live has. I dont think Ive given up I have given up, like Im going to kill myself either tonight or tomorrow. Ive started self harming again and my I already know how to get my dads gun to get it over with.",
    "What can I do to help my family member My brother needs help. Im not sure where to start. He has been drinking pretty heavily for years. Recently he did get help and was put on meds but when the prescription ran out he didnt get another for weeks, has new meds now but hates taking them due to being drowsy and finding hard to function at work. Ive recently moved in with him. I cook and clean for him, chat to him when he wants to chat. He says he doesnt need help or he cant be helped, that hes independent but does thank me any time I do stuff for him. I want to show him hes loved and tell him this. He thinks Im being emotional and not to worry about him. Ive suggested trying different meds, going with him to talk to someone, taking time off work to trial different meds, he agrees he needs time off though feels bad to his team at work amp his boss. I guess I just need advice on what I can do to help and not be overbearing or annoying to him. Hes gotten a lot worse these past few weeks and I cant help but think Its my fault or Im doing something wrong. I cant say Ive ever been in his position so Im at a loss on what to do.",
    "New illness diagnosis is ruining my life I have a lot of deadlines coming up this week which have made me anxious every day for almost 2 weeks now. The anxiety has made my physical illness flair up to the point where I have to miss school, I cant eat, sleep, or be productive. Im so so sad because of this. It happened all at once and I dont know how to manage it. Ive been crying almost every day because I miss when I felt better. The physical illness is new diagnosed in March and its extremely overwhelming. It makes me feel hopeless every day. Some people get better and some people get worse. Idk if I believe I can get better, but I want to. Its just so hard for me to envision living the rest of my life suffering like this. My therapist who Ive been seeing for 2 years is now taking 6 months off. Ive tried to find a new therapist but they either arent taking new patients or dont even respond to my phone calls. Im so lost. I dont know what to do.",
    "19 years old and its pretty obvious there's no reason to go any further Just graduated High School May 2019 and turned 19 at then end of September but now that Im finally done with school whats next for me? Working as a slave for 50 years? Or putting myself thousands of dollars behind just to go to college setting me back years just to still be a slave anyways? Id rather be dead than do that. I work at a pizza place making 8.75hr and live with my parents. My brother and I want to move out but I cant imagine doing that because thatll require me to find another job to enslave myself in and thats just not how I want my life to go on. Ive seen plenty of threads here on Reddit talking about how they cant keep doing this life of working all day coming home exhausted then sleeping and doing it all over again. Like I said Im 19 and I feel exhausted just working 6 hours a day, Im still a teenager I should be running around young wild and free enjoying life. I sleep about 1214 hours a day and I still take naps and otherwise Im alone in my room playing videos games just to keep my mind off this hellbent reality I was given or typing shit on Reddit because I feel so helpless that I need someone else on the internet to see if they can give me any advise. I have absolutely no social life, never had a girlfriend, still a virgin and unbearably lonely plus the realization that I either must be a slave for the rest of my life or a worthless homeless nobody on the street has caused me to become deathly depressed. I barely even eat because Im too depressed to even crave food, I can tell Im hungry but mentally I have no interest in food unless Im smoking weed. Ive tried meditation and have a strong interest in psychedelics for personal development but all thats done is make me realize just how fake and unreal this 21 century society really is. Id rather live in the wild foraging for food like a monkey over working my ass off for hours a day just for money green paper that people think is so good and meaningful I just dont understand.",
    "My (24) boyfriend (30) told me having a child is the only point of life and if he found out he was infertile, he would kill himself. Cross posted in rrelationshipadvice because theyre all telling me to break up with him and not offering advice for the helping him not want to kill himself part.... I dont know what to do. Ive been dating my boyfriend for just over a year we had been friends with benefits for 3 years before that, so weve known each other a LONG time and we discovered early on that he wanted children and I didnt. We decided to keep seeing each other but open the relationship since we knew it couldnt be long term and we both could look for other partners. He turned 30 this January and we broke up because he wanted to start looking for a partner to have children with but we got back together two weeks later because we honestly love each other a lot and love spending time with one another. Plus then quarantine happened, so I assumed we would be able to continue as is to keep having each other to comfort and love when its basically impossible to start dating new people... Recently when Im not spending the night with him at his place, hell get extremely drunk and sad and not tell me. He texted me this morning that he got drunk last night and called a girl he impregnated 4 years ago who then got an abortion. He said he had to come to terms with the fact that he couldve had a four year old child now. Today I called him and hes been drinking all morning as of noon and he was watching bojack horseman and crying. He says the only reason hes depressed is because he doesnt have a child and the only reason he drinks is because hes sad that he doesnt have a child. But he loves me and is sad because I have the ability to change my mind and decide to have a child but i wont. And so naturally i said, oh but you could decide to not have a child and be with me forever, why is the impetus only on me? Then he said having a child is the only reason to be alive. He wants to see me pregnant and watch our child go to school and comfort them if they got bullied etc.",
    "Feeling at the end of the line I didnt confront the issue till I was 24 and a girlfriend that I used to talk to and sort of wanted something more were talking about our feelings and I just plained told her what had happened to me and she told me that something similar happened to her at a similar age, we cried and talked about it and other things, strangely even as we felt closer after this we went our separate ways being just good friends to this day she is married, lives in a different country and has a baby, after that I worked through my trauma alone with little success side note, there is a history of violent tendencies in the men of my family, both from my mothers and fathers side, and Im basically the mixed result. A couple years later I met my first long relationship girlfriend and as you can imagine I fell hard for her and spoiled her like crazy, she helped my reconnect with my father and I told her about my trauma and to my surprise she also was a victim, we both tried to get professional help within our means but only I got serious about it and kept going to my sessions, she said she was fine on her own and knowing how hard this was I let her take her own choice and just tried to be supportive when needed, needless to say it ended bad, near the end when we were about to move in together I tried to start a conversation about how we began getting together and how special she was to me, apparently I was the only one that felt that way because she told me that the only reason she kissed me and begun hanging out with me was because she felt pity for me, we had other issues like a poor sexual life and not enough time on her part for us, so after she told me about how we really had begun our relationship I felt numbed and after a few days in emotional hell I broke up with her, I listed all that was wrong with the relationship and told her that something that begins with pity cant have a future, I wasnt able to tell her that that was what hurt me the must, she never apologized and we went our separate ways, her family loved me and knew I was the good guy and I was the best for her and tried to help but never went passed of a small conversation with me, they were harder on her but in the end they are her family, I found out she also cheated later on and it was what killed the last pieces of love I had for her, I didnt confront her about it and we never spoke ever again, the pity confession destroyed my self confidence we were together for close to 4 years.",
    "The current situation has caused a HUGE setback Hey everyone. I hope you are doing better during this crazy time than I am. A bit of background Im a California girl in my 50s. And, Ive struggled for 20 years to fight off very intense anxiety and depression. I have been unable to work since 2014. Ive got a claim for SSDI, but apparently Im not sick enough. SMH I married my high school sweetheart May of 2018. He was the one that got away. I was never happier. After choosing the wrong guys all my life, I finally choose the right guy! Then in October he fell ill with an unknown lung disease. By the 21st of December I lost my love, my best friend he just couldnt breathe anymore. He put up a valiant fight. I was immediately hospitalized in the psych unit. I was overwhelmed with grief. I wanted to die. I wanted to be with him. I even tried several times to make that happen. And to add fuel too the fire, my dad passed away three months after my husband. Im not ashamed to say I was Daddys Little Girl. And I miss him just as much as my husband. So, for a whole year I struggled and fight my depression and anxiety. In that year, I was hospitalized 10 times, for psych and other ailments I have. But sometime after the 1 year mark when he died, I kinda just came out of the fog. I was feeling so much better, reaching out to his mom and other friends. I was so glad that I was gonna beat this. Fast forward to the present. I am an isolater by nature, so this covid19 situation I know I can get through it. I have one good friend and my motherinlaw for support. I keep my appointments with my psychiatrist, and take my meds as prescribed. I have no income, since I have to go through the entire process with Social Security before I can qualify to receive spousal benefits. Basically, what he was earning. Thank the good Lord for food stamps and Food Share, Ill never go hungry.",

We have two single friends who were able to get homeloans and buy a place. These two friends have a fair but of support from their parents. I just cant help feeling so damn jealous. We have been saving and saving. We dont have kids. We both do shift work and always do opposite shifts so we dont see each other a lot and its hard. I just get so mad. Like why is it so easy for others but so hard for us? Im happy for our friends, but at the same time, so mad and so jealous. How do I stop this?",
    "Drowning in my own tears I F22 am a reserved person and never really had a positive or functional family life. My dad died when I was 10 and my mom youngest of her family never really moved on from that and has always been dependent on other people. My childhood home was foreclosed and at age 18 I lived in a crusty trailer park with her for three years. Finally out now, but the deep emotional turmoil is still with me. Its been a long journey to accept and let go of grief and constant longing for a protective nurturing positive figure. My current boyfriend of 2 years and 4 months has been there for me more often than Id like to admit to get me out of that trailer park to finally start living on our own. And were finally doing that and for that Im very grateful. But its been obvious that I am still emotionally dependent and needy. Ive had over sixteen weeks of therapy and its helped a lot but this is the hardest obstacle Ive had to tackle with myself, trying to build resilience and harden myself like my partner has. We had a long talk tonight basically about what wed change about each other. He said he feels like my parent sometimes and that he can only rely on himself and maybe 2 other people, sometimes. But not me because Im not in a fully realized independent position yet. To be honest that struck me like an arrow. I already told him if he feels like he has to act like a parent, Id rather him not act at all. I dont want to be constantly coddled or comforted, and I told him its not fair to assume he can only rely on himself if he doesnt give me a chance to. We ended this conversation on a good note that we both have to make changes and now hes hanging out with our friendsroommates but for the past 3 hours Im still upset and crying in the room I told him I needed space. Why is letting go so hard for me. Why is it when I feel this shitty and keep thinking about my dad that I have to be the most alone. Its been over 12 years but I feel like I cant move on like my mom hasnt and one of my biggest fears is ending up like her.",

    "Still hurting from betrayal I posted awhile back but I am still having trouble and I would appreciate the support. My 26M ex gf 26F cheated on me and left me for some guy she had only known for 3 weeks. I loved her so much. We had been together for almost 7 years. We had plans to get married and buy a home together. To travel together have kids and start a family together She abandoned me and the dog we raised together for some low life with no career or education that pursued her knowing we were in a committed relationship. It hurts. There are so many memories of the good times we spent together. I was so close with her family. She had always said she couldnt imagine her life without me. Now shes off with this horrible person acting like theyre soulmates. I know I deserve better than someone who would cheat on me and lie about it. I am just still having trouble believing she actually did this to me and that shes gone and never coming back. I was such a good boyfriend. I made her breakfast in bed and surprised her with dinner when she had a late shift. I would plan special surprises for the holidays and birthdays. Yet she still cheated on me and left me.

    "Trouble with persistent fatigue- not medical Hey all, I am a 24F who has dealt with depression for about 9 years with varying severity. I am currently on Effexor after trying a bunch of meds and stable enough that Ive held down a FT job for 3.5 years and now have a livein partner. The details of my days, however, arent great. I dont have energy or desire for hobbies beyond cooking dinner sometimes and watching an evening TV show with my boyfriend. I often find myself mentally exhausted and ready to shut down either at 5pm after work or later on around 8.309pm. It gets worse on days when Ive struggled with negative thoughts. My partner doesnt really like how I go to bed early a lot, and is hurt that I dont want to stay up and spend time with him. I want to not always be so tired. After getting bloodwork done last week I know this is 100 psychological my Dr. knew about my fatigue but said my results were great. Id like to be the kind of person who goes to the gym or for a walk after work but I always feel too heavy and sad. I often dont want to be awake if I could just be asleep and escape feeling sad negative tired. What can I do to fix this? Has anyone been in a similar situation? Thank you.",

Ive been struggling for as long as hes known me and it hasnt gotten any better throughout the course of our time together.

    "Years of worsening chronic fatigue/fog continue to cripple my life As a result, I feel intoxicated more easilyquickly. Sometimes 1 beer and Im already feeling really drunk. Im slow now both mentally and physically. Head almost always feels very tired and heavy, but I dont get headaches that often. I yawn way too much. Anhedonia and apathy as Ive gotten tireder and tireder. I have gradually become indifferent to most things. I literally come across like an emotionless zombie now because I am so damn exhausted 247. Almost nothing phases or interests me anymore. I feel like I get every coldflu virus that comes around. And it takes me much longer to get over them. I am emotionally flat lined. One of my eyelids droops a little bit, mostly later in the day andor when Im more tired. I feel like I need lots of sleep to recover, but all sleep really does is reset me a little bit and is very unrefreshing. All of these symptoms seem to be worse when Im sick, stressed, get less sleep, etc. Overall, it feels like I was hit by a truck. From the moment I wake up to the moment I pass out from sheer exhaustion at night. Everything feels like its suppressed by this fog that has gradually gotten worse over time. For example, caffeines effect, sex drive, postworkout adrenaline and endorphins, getting plenty of sleep, etc. I can sort of FEEL all these things for the most part, but it feels hidden and pushed down from this utter exhaustion. Its like nothing can surpass the fatigue and fog. Its gotten to the point where I feel like Im living my life from the backseat and am just going through the day mindlessly on autopilot. It literally gives me anxiety and depression to feel like this and not know why, and watch my life just pass me by at the same time. And the thing that sucks is that I WANT to do things and live life, and am still pretty optimistic, but Im just too out of it, its embarrassing. I come across like a drugged zombie when I try.",
    "A few years ago I (17f) got groomed and forced into sexual activity online and now the guy is threatening me from random anonymous accounts to keep obliging to his needs or else he'll post my nudes. So 3 years ago I got forced into sexual activity online and the person somehow recorded everything. I was a drunkard back then and didnt know what happened. I am clean of it now and I have a loving boyfriend 18M, for the past one year and he knows about it. Both of us are in pain because of this. The dude has been texting me for the past one year repeatedly making me satisfy his needs. If I block him he creates other accounts. Ive already gone through physical sexual abuse when I was a child. So its really getting to me. Im on the edge of sanity already. My parents are abusive so I cant explain to them either if I try to inform the police about it. Please help. Im breaking down.",
    "Life’s going downhill and everything that happens is mainly my fault For starters Im 13 years old. Im in the 7th grade and this issue has been going on for what Id say about a year now. I dont know if whats going on even is depression, maybe Im just being edgy. To be frank, I have no idea anymore. The more I stress about it the more I try talking about it with my friends, and sometimes they ignore it, other times they tell me to stop being emo. Also, FYI, this will be really long. The fact of the matter is that things havent been going well. We can start at my grades. You see, my brother age 25 is a collage dropout and my sister age 21 is still doing great and Im happy for her. The thing is that because my brother had dropped out of collage he has a job now and is starting to get back on track and is still living with my parents and struggling, I feel this pressure that I need to do well and be the best I can to not end up like him. Im sure thats normal, but the one problem is my mother. I always try to satisfy her, seeing the smile and satisfaction on her face is my dream, but she never seems to be satisfied. If I brought home Bs that wasnt good enough. If I got an answer wrong on my test even though I still got a good grade it wasnt good enough because I got something wrong. When I brought home my interim, I got 3 Bs and 4 As and when she saw, all she did was ask if I needed help because my grades were dropping. It hurt me. She wants me to become an orthodontist. When I brought home this report thingie on my level 15 on english and writing, I got a level 5. Only 7 of students in my state got that. However there was also one for science and math, I got a level 4 on that, which is what most people in my state got. When she saw, she told me to do better because I math and science are more important for becoming a orthodontist. I feel helpless. My next issue is this incident that happened with my crush.",

    "Depression is getting a lot worse So a bit of background, Ive struggled with mental health since a very young age. Ive been in therapy several times, and have been on antidepressants and antianxiety meds for 3 years. Ive always thought my depression was situational, and Ive worked really hard to change my life for the better. The past 612 months have been the best Ive ever felt, as such I made the decision to start trying to come off my antidepressants. My GP advised to take the pill on alternative nights which Ive been doing for the past few weeks. However this past week my depression has came back a lot worse, and Im really struggling with urges to hurt myself. I guess Im looking for advice if anyone else has experienced this when trying to come off meds? Thanks for any advice offered, Ill really appreciate it.",

I work with his dad and do talk to him about this stuff but theres only so much i can talk about with him as he lost both his son and daughter in the same night and doesnt know how to handle things himself. The other person i was incredibly close with completed our trio died of an overdose a few hours after id left his house.

The problem lies whenever i ask if she wants to stop me texting she dont reply but actually tries to avoid it. I have now seen it was a weak spot for me. She was my only friend and i am not open to my family. Now because of this my concentration and mental stability is gone i suffer from schizophrenia.

As someone who has chronic, but still functioning depression, its been a real struggle to be productive and better myself while Im depressed, which, unfortunately, is practically everyday for me. I usually do the bare minimum going to work, making myself look put together, etc. But, tasks outside of that tend to fall by the wayside, and I notice that Im not bettering myself or my future. I have looked this up before, i.e. how to do things when youre depressed and usually I come across articles that explain how to get basic things done and reminding the reader that the small stuff is important too. While I really appreciate this sentiment, I want to know, how do I not only exist with my depression, but also flourish? Like, doing things that will favor me in the long run? What do other people with depression do? Maybe some success stories would be helpful? also, a side note Im currently being medically treated for depression, so Im not really looking for specifically medical advice Thank you!",
    "Im so confused on what to do. I cant let myself be depressed because it will make my gf more depressed. Ik everyone says make sure to take care of yourself but I honestly dont care about taking care of me, at least not while she is going through it as bad as she is now, but at the same time my efforts are wasted. Things arent getting better only worse. She was ranting the other day and I actually did stop and tell her I couldnt mentally handle it and it upset her and i feel like i cant fix myself yet because im trying to help her but its not helping her so its just a big ol depression loop. I want to take time for me but cant because i want to take care of her more. I hate that i want to help so bad.",
    "i had to say goodbye to my sweet boy today after finding out yesterday cancer is ravaging his body. ive never wanted to simply wait in a waiting room longer, but they called us right back. i prayed that the doctor was tied up and would take a while before she got back there, but no sooner did i finish thinking that she came in. i felt myself detach from my body at that point. i cant remember anything she said, but i know from the time she came in the room to the time she left the room was only about five minutes. my babys body was so tired, it had been fighting so hard for so long. he was gone before the injection to stop his heart was even finished. my world and heart suddenly felt so... empty. i was wailing in the vets office, the pain is so deep. the doctor told me our grief is only a reflection of our love, and i believe that 100. i genuinely dont think i could love my boy even an OUNCE more because my little heart would give out. im back home now, my other dogs dont understand why their brother isnt here. i never ever expected my maximus to be the first to go. i have two other senior dogs, and maximus is the youngest. i felt so sure i had at least 34 more years with him, and i feel so robbed. i wasnt remotely prepared, i had zero clue this was coming. the one comfort i have is i dont feel remorse over the amount of time i spent with him. i dont feel like i wish i wouldve sat with him and pet him more because that dog was at my side constantly. any spare second i have im laying with him. anywhere i go, hes the one that gets up in the car and rides with me. he loves a car ride. i always surprise him with a mcdouble, and the excitement he shows never ever ever gets old. im not prepared for all of that to be a fond memory. im scared, because i know in time ill forget how it felt to pet that big block head and i dont ever want to.",

I had a conversation with my brother recently and he was talking about how im going to be applying for top universities and how I could get business scholarships to help pay for it and secure a job placement if im one of the top performers which I could be, and how I need to consider the amount of debt ill be in from it when I get married, buy a house, get a car, have kids etcetera. I just... dont feel optimistic about my prospects anymore. I dont even care about the debt, I cant see myself ever buying a house and I cant even bring myself to imagine having a so and kids. All I want to do is go to bed and not move from under the covers... I dont know when this even happened. I was at the top of my school for exams, got accepted into one of the best colleges in my country, and im studying hard to get good grades in my subjects as well as maintaining extracurriculars.

    "I got cheated on by my now ex-boyfriend of six years and I feel worthless First time poster here. On mobile. Ive known this guy since we were in middle school, we started talking during high school, and after a failed attempt at my life I dropped out of college moved back home and we ended up dating. This guy had been my rock for all those years. He experienced with me the pain of having my dad get a stroke, my only uncle on my dads side pass away, being diagnosed with ovarian cancer, having my dads mom pass away, my dad have a second stroke, and finding out my mom had breast cancer and going through chemo. Things werent always perfect. I nagged a lot on things he did because he tend to me reckless and not have a plan. Overall I just wanted things to be better for him. To be prepared and essentially have a backup plan. This year he started going through a rough phase at work, being in a call center and having upset customers he would take it to heart when they would tell him to kill himself. For a very long time I told him to find someone to talk to, to go look for a counselor. He never did and I saw him get worse and worse. I tried being the best support I could for him. It was only fair and obviously I did it because I loved him. On the November 7th he finally spoke to a counselor. I asked how it went and he said it went well. Then on November 9th he asked to speak to me once I arrived home from being out of town. He arrived at my house after work. He begins explaining to me that when he was talking to his counselor he was asked what made him happy and responded with photography. He mentioned that he never thought of us. Which is fair because it had been rocky. He said he didnt love me anymore. He finished what he said and waited for me to reply. I was in shock. I didnt realize just how bad it was. It was like a curve ball was thrown at me. I didnt know because he never opened up to me even when I asked.",

    "Depression and anxiety in cross cultural relationships? Year round I contend with anxiety and depression, successfully medicated for around 10 years now. Each winter I battle SAD in the form of depression and anxiety, and all the fun ways in which those can manifest themselves. Work interactions and personal relationships in particular suffer my closest friends either seem not to notice or just cut me a load of slack, for which Im grateful! This past summer I began dating someone who lives in another part of the US and grew up in the Philippines. As December rolled into January I explained how this time of year often affects me and I expect even more so by working strictly from home. I also reminded her that I take prescription meds. Her response is that Americans are weak and we should just get our and walk plus spend time with others, as no one in her home country ever has to take medication. That kind of sounds like bullshit in general, and also felt very insensitive for her to have said. Is it typical for other cultures to regard Americans in such a way regarding mental illness?",
    "How do I help my depressed sister? My sister comes to me almost every night talking about how she is depressed because she has 0 friends and she cant make any friends no matter how hard she tries. Her other problems consist of being 18 and not even close to having a boyfriend she has never had a boyfriend, being sick of school and wanting to skip getting her associates and getting straight to work, and shes also pretty self conscious of her body and her socially awkwardness in front of others. I am 16 and I truly cannot understand her issues. She talks to me for hours about her problems and when I try to give her advice she gets frustrated. I dont have any friends either, I am also socially awkward, and I also am very self conscious. We share all the same problems the only difference is that she cares way too much and I dont care at all. The advice I try to give her is to show her how and why she shouldnt care. I dont understand how she can care so much about these issues. I understand sometimes but its not a constant battle for me, I eventually continue not caring about my issues and am happy again. Im worried about her because she talks about wanting to kill herself and Im the only person in our family she can talk to because she is afraid of making my parents more depressed than they are. My questions are How do I go about caring for her? Should I just listen to her problems or should I advise her to care less? Perhaps neither of those things?",

    "I am so confused Ill be straight forward, Im not diagnosed yet. I havent really been checked so I may still very well suffer from the condition, but I apologize if I dont qualify to post here. So my problem begins maybe three years back. Out of nowhere Im randomly sad about myself for no reason in particular. I brushed it off as regular old sadness and have no other thought. Then a couple months later I notice its happening more and more frequently. I thought it could genuinely have been depression, but I was convinced into brushing it off as teen angst. Over the next year it stayed the same, random bouts of sadness and lack of motivation for a day or two at the time. Fast forward to now and Ive started being sad nearly daily. I can sometimes go a week and rarely close to a month without experiencing severely as I have, but like I said thats it sometimes. I have suicidal thoughts so often theyve stopped bothering me. I quite often cry at night and have recently started drinking when this happens. I sometimes think I want to die but I know there are people who care. I have a loving family and great friends. I just cant get what I want out of life and I dont want to live a long unfulfilled life. Dont get me wrong, Id much rather be happy and live for as long as possible, but part of me wants to give up. Im not asking for professional diagnosis, but would you say this is regular sadness or am I verging on depression? Thanks, anon",
    "Ghosted by Son and His Mom Ive been dealing really well with depression for awhile. Mostly just some hard spikes up in depression where its a few hours of intense depression and anxiety. But this has got me in the numb, why bother zone, which I feel is the most dangerous because it can last for so long. My son late teens and I had a pretty good relationship as far as I could tell, and for being half a country apart. We chatted online almost every day, and sometimes game online. Its his preferred way of communicating. We had a great time together this summer. He stopped responding about 3 weeks ago. I texted him and he politely said the equivalent of, I need some space for about a week, just working something out. I respect that and I let him know that. I asked his mom if it was something I should worry about or if theres anything I can do to help. She responded that its teenager stuff and hes not in danger. Son lives with depression and anxiety too. So I give space. 2 weeks go by. I message him just to check in and let him know I love him. Nothing. Then a message about his upcoming psychologist appointment. I say that its scary to me that he needs to see a psychologist, but I dont know anything about whats going on. No response. I email his mom, we mostly talk Christmas gifts but no answers about how our son is doing. Its been over 3 weeks now. I emailed his mom again a couple days ago. No response. Im worried for him. She has left me uninformed about very important things about our son before. This is extremely unusual for him, especially for this time of year. Were usually chatting about Christmas stuff. I feel like throwing up. Im very worried for him. Maybe he is ok. Maybe this is just what happens. I understood the day could come when he goes off on his own and Im an occasional thought and memory. Thats what I could get for living so far away since he was a toddler. Whole other story why that happened that Im not going to get into.",

    "I’m lost Suicide thoughts First of all , I wanna say sorry for my bad English. I didnt go to psychiatrist , but Im pretty sure I have depression for 4 years . Back then I just felt like I lost all my positive emotions for no reason all of suden and I told it to friends and family and everybody was like  Its normal, it happens , it will disappeared... I cannot feel almost anything, when someone close to me die, I cant cry , when something good happens ,I cant smile sometimes but very rare I can feel euphoria  . I had no motivation and hope for better future then, and now is same . I have little health problems for 5 years ,and I cant even force my self to go to doctor because Im affraid of diagnosis, and things are worse now. People think Im doing a little bit better then earlier because I passed my entrance examination for college one month agolast year all my friends did it, I decided to make a one year break  . But college dont change anything. I m still big pesimits and cant feel anything. Actually I can feel fear. I have very strong social anxiety. I have 5 very close friends , they are like brothers to me and Im relaxed when Im with them , but when I talk to girls , Im totally confused. They even cant understand what Im saying because I dont open my mouth enough and speak very quiet ... I never had a girlfriend... Lets go back to social anxiety. Its very hard to go to for example market because Im overthinking what if someone asks me something, ... I have very good relationship with mother, not good but no bad relationship with sister , and very bad relationship with father its almost hate . I also have very often mood changings and I also take decisions very hard because I dont know what I want , and even when I take a decision, I change it very quick . I like watching soccer and basketball but its hard to concentrate to watching because my mind flyes somewhere... I cant find purpose of life. People dont understand how its hard when someone says  JUST FORCE YOURSELF AND GO TO DOCTOR , JUST GO OUT MAKE NEW FRIENDS ,... Sorry for long message .",

Nobody wants to implement alternative solutions when Ive tried to present them to people. Nobody wants to even touch me, let alone care if Im on the cusp of deciding to end my life.

They only want to stop me to save face, and I cant pull myself back when they want to stop me for reasons as selfish as why I want to end my life tonight.

    "First-time depression Hi guys, its my first time on reddit. Im getting kinda depressed right now, mostly because of my disappointments. I put all my hopes and efforts into a competition and now that I failed my expectation was expecting a second prize but got a consolation one. More ironically, my boyfriend got a first prize which was kinda unbelievable and unprecedented in my school for the past 10 years. To make matters worse, he is entering university next year. Helping him with his academic profiles and scholarship applications made me really proud of him but concurrently selfpitiful. I feel a little inferior to him and constantly downplay myself without knowing how to stop. Both events struck me profoundly and Im confused as to what to do. I think recently Im suffering from depression since I have been haunted by selfharm and suicidal thoughts. I have yet to try committing suicide but actually harmed myself with a knife.

The worst part about being like that, is that its devouring you from the inside. The hate gets real!! I start to think positively about people now, I tell myself how well they are doing and that they deserve it, instead of being jealous and hateful. I hope this works, and Ive been doing this for months now, sadly I relapsed because I was talking with someone who kind of has the same problems as I do, but instead of keeping our hateful conversation for himself, he snitched on me by telling my sibling your brother is such a good friend, we understand each other so well simply by how similar we talk crap about other people. I got got confronted for that and to be honest? I think its good that this person snitched on me, because I clearly deserve some ass whoopin. So..... Im at the bottom again, my whole process was for nothing...

    "Soon to be dad and I’m struggling to cope So Ive written posts about this before but heres the basics. My pregnant girlfriend split up with me. She said she dident love me anymore. I lost my temper and said some things I shouldnt have which I admit was my fault. We dident talk or have any contact for 6 weeks I drunk heavily during this time and my depression was unbearable. I eventually reached out and apologised and explained I wanted to be there for the baby. She agrees I meet her for the first time since we broke up and she makes it clear she never wants to get back together and just wants to be friends. So since then Ive cut right back on my drinking intact I dont drink anymore. As the son of a alcoholic looser father I dont want that for my child I want to be a good dad. Anyway every time I talk to her it feels like a kick in the teeth. So I actively avoid messaging her and only respond to her when she messages me cause of all the pain it brings up. The only thing keeping me going is the baby. But its been 10 weeks since we broke up and I still feel just as broken and miserable inside. I dont have any friends I sit on my PlayStation all day just trying to zone out and focus on something other than how miserable I am. I thought that when I stopped drinking I would feel better and to be honest I dont I still feel like shit. I have a therapist whos helpful and a support worker to help me not go back to drinking. But it doesnt help much and to be honest I just dont know what to do anymore.",
    "Life’s going downhill and everything that happens is mainly my fault I beg to them not to as it obviously makes her uncomfortable but they wont stop, my sin wont leave me, no matter what I do. Its still on my back, and this one kid wont leave me alone about it, and he antagonizes me about it. The sad truth is that I cant blame anyone. It was my fault, I shouldnt of said that. Ironically the week after this happened our school got a presentation on cyber safety. My last issue, and arguably the one that makes me sad and angry, are my friends. I dont think its their fault. I believe its just mine for acting stupid and making so many horrible choices, so I cant blame them. But they never have anything good to say about me. Ever since kindergarten, I was constantly being reminded of how stupid and idiotic I was. Now they wont leave me alone for how much of a disappointment I am, how Im stupid, and they constantly make fun of me and wont leave me alone for my mistakes, as well as making up lies. Hell, one friend is calling me a pedophilia because I like Asian girls and theyre shorter than me or some shit, even though the ones I sorta like are in my age group. If theres an argument on the bus, Im the main problem because I spook to loudly and disturbed everyone. If I had an argument with someone and we have a fight, they always bring up a point that makes me realize Im the wrong one. No matter how much I compliment them, they never have anything good to say back aside from my idiotic ignorance. Overall, I want to commit suicide more than anything. The thing is, I just cant being myself to because 1. Its forbidden in the Bible 2. What would my parents think? I cant just leave them. But still, regardless of all of that, I still want to end my life and go with the Lord. However, the moment I see the Lord, Im going to see the gate of hell for all my sins and what I have done. Im vulgar, perverted, violent, etc.",
    "Does anyone else feel like the saturation in their life is turned down? The best way I can describe how I feel is feeling as if someone has turned down the saturation in my life. I can feel emotions. When Im with friends and family or watch a funny video I laugh and smile, but it just feels empty? Lifeless? Like on a scale of 110 10 being the happiest I know I should be feeling a 10 and in general the situation is a 10 but for some reason I cant seem to get past a 5 at most. Its like my brain is saying this is funny you should laugh and feel happy but I just dont feel that? At least not fully. Its like my 5 is other peoples 10s, both are fully happy just one is less than the other. When other people are laughing so much theyre in tears and cant catch their breath Im only chuckling, even though I know the situation is funny. I cant even remember a time where I laughed so much I was in tears. When I laugh it almost feels like a chore or an automatic response that I could just as easily not do. This is hard to explain but when I laugh and smile its like im not physically feeling it. What I imagine true happiness to feel like is a warmness, something you can physically feel in your body, but when I smilelaugh the outside physically changes but inside I dont feel anything. It almost feels as if Im acting but Im not because I do know the situation is funny. Its like theres a disconnect somewhere. Its hard to explain. And this is just one emotion, I feel this with everything. The only emotions I seem to be able to feel the strongest are annoyanceanger and sadness, but even thats toned down, not saturated, lifeless.",
    "I can’t go more than 5 minutes without crying These last few weeks have been the hardest in my life. After covid cleared out college campuses and my partner and I were forced to go back home my boyfriends family told him since he was back living under their roof he would have to follow every one of their demands. In the town where we go to college we were seeing each other multiple times a week. And the week before we were booted we spent every hour together. As soon as we got home his family told him he could no longer see me. I understand we are in a pandemic but we had been swapping spit even that same day they told him to quarantine. If he had anything I definitely had it and vice versa. I agreed to two weeks not seeing each other, not knowing how hard it would be. Even after that ended they didnt want us to see each other because during that time my state issued a stay at home order. I have not been able to see friends obviously and my family is abusive and toxic there isnt a single day in the house that there arent screaming matches. I lost my motivation to do any of my classes that went online. I stopped eating, I started drinking, and taking pills in incrementing amounts hoping I would gather the courage to kill myself. I started cutting myself so I could distract myself from the emotional pain. All I do is lie in bed, and get water once a day. I cry so often starting as soon as I wake up, and even more so at night. I havent been able to sleep well, sometimes at all. I only fear this situation is going to get worse and it feels like there will be no end. It was a shock to come from months of being with my person so happy to have it all stripped away so suddenly. If anyone has any tips that would help me, Id appreciate it.",
    "Should I get myself checked in to a psychiatric ward so they can force me to start my antidepressant? The more scared I get the worse my anxiety gets. The worse my anxiety gets the more I get scared, and it gets even harder to start my medicine. Lately I havent been able to think about anything else other than my bowel issues, I cant even watch a youtube video. Im not suicidal I have suicidal thoughts yes but I havent made any plans, and I have things I want to do, you know? I dropped out of college, and I want to go back. Im not even exaggerating when I say this I see myself going back to school literally every night in my dreams. I have gender dysphoria, and I want to at least know how it feels like to be comfortable in your own body. And these things keep me going. But I also know that I have to take my medicine, and I just dont know how I can do that. I thought of a couple things that I can try. First, I can get myself checked in to a psychiatric ward. Make them force me to take my medicine. There are several upsides and downsides with that. If I get an anxiety attack they can intervene. I will be forced to take the medicine, so it has a higher probability of success. But on the other hand, the psychiatric wards in my country have some problems. Ive read a lot about human rights violations, abuse, mistreatment, violence etc. And Im sure you can understand, I dont need this stuff on top of my problems. Also since Im not a danger to myself or to others they might not even accept me. Also my parents will probably be very angry with me, because I dont look very nervous or stressed from outside. Second, find a way to start taking them on my own. I can ask to start from a lower dose. My psych wanted me to start at 150mg. Effexor XR is available with dosages as low as 37.5mg. I can ask for anti anxiety medication. I have anti nausea medication, and I can take that while starting.",

    "How can i help my girlfriend with her depression? I hope i am right in this sub. My Girlfriend has a form of depression and also goes to a therapist regularly. At the beginning she tried not to talk about this topic which i totally can understand sincs im not ger boyfriend for a very long time and she is a bit ashamed about it. But with the time we had conversations about it and i think it helped her to talk with somebody about and who isnt her therapist. But in Situations like a mental breakdown or really depressed phases i just dont know how to react. I want to understand and help her but i also dont want to make it worse with conversations which only seem good to me. So can you give me any advise on how to support her without making it worse?",
    "I'm so tired Thats when the topic of school opening came up, there was a virtual and hybrid option, I wanted to stay home and they were dead set on getting me back in. That led to a lot of usually hour long arguments with my mom where we went in complete circles, I was just scared and worried for my familys health, but eventually I was sent in to school. Around this time my Grandma passed away, it came out of nowhere and added to the confusion of it all. Ive always been accepting of death and everything, but it still hurt a lot to go through. I missed her, and I just had no idea what was going on anymore. I also struggled with intrusive thoughts a lot, something that continues even now. They went from anything as random as questioning my gender to recurring thoughts of suicide, I had absolutely no control of them but them just being there constantly drained a lot out of me. School was rough, none of my friends were in person, meeting new people was really hard with no after school stuff, and teachers clearly werent having an easy time adjusting to teaching this way. Motivation was hard again, I tried drawing and going outside as much as possible just so I could do something at least, but I didnt feel better. Being at school was just a constant reminder of what position we were all in, I just missed having a normal uneventful year of school at this point. Eventually cases started rising again and I wanted to switch to virtual school again, so yet again I fought with my parents about it every other day. School was miserable, no one was there anymore, no one I knew and none of the familiar faces I didnt, I just wanted to be with my friends at home at least then I could talk to them in class. My memories are fuzzy here but I remember a really bad spiral. I ran out of therapy appointments, it didnt really help anyways and my therapist never really gave me any methods to feel better instead of just trying to do things more.",

    "I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts for as long as I can remember and it's only getting harder to reason against harming myself. I never had a catalyst or anything for my depression or suicidal ideations. Its just been present for a very long time. Ive gone through prescribed regimens of medication, seen counselors, stayed active and healthy, made friends very easily, and just overall tried to keep myself out there and try or experience new things to see if I could find that calling in life for myself over my life. Things have generally gone very well for me in life other than the numerous times I let my suicidal thoughts get the best of me and I either let shit fall apart or an attempt on my own life puts me down a notch. This has been something thats just always been present and feels very dominating as a part of who I am. It used to scare me and I used to want to feel better than this, but I just feel completely indifferent and empty to it and everything else in life now. I dont have the energy to pretend Im a normal person or talk to people, I dont experience any emotions, all of my old hobbies and such feel like a chore, and I cant envision wanting anything in the future. This depersonalization side of my suicidal ideations has been going on for a couple years now and more than ever I just cant find any reason or desire to stay alive. Ive been miserable for as long as I can remember and I know its not right, but, at this point I dont know any other mindset other then feeling this way. I know how to be a decent human being, I do good at work and such, Ive developed very close relationships in platonic and romantic senses before, but nothing makes it feel worth the effort at all. Im at my wits end and I got rope today and Im so afraid of how much itll hurt but I want this to be over with so bad and I just dont know what to do.",
    "How do I (14 M) talk to my (Typical Indian) dad about seeing a therapist? Tldr at bottom Hey guys. So, for context I am a 14 yo dude from India. I have a typical Indian dad, so that means conservative and not so openminded, and we arent close either. We havent really talked about anything else other than studies and me being a failure in the past... 3 years or so. I have been depressed and suicidal for about 2 years now and have been cutting for about a year. I think I might have anxiety, but not really sure about that. So, with that in mind, heres whats I need help with About a month ago, I tried talking to my dad about my cuts. I went to him and showed him my recent scars and he asked what they were. I told him they were cuts with a razor blade and he didnt ask me why but instead started screaming at me about me not studying and that I cut myself because of Youtube As it had rotten my brain. He told me that he would have listened to me and helped if I had gotten good grades Like, above 95 but since I havent gotten good grades I have like a 7580 overall, he doesnt give a fuck. I couldnt even tell him about what was bothering me. The first thing I said was insecurities, and he said I dont know the first thing about being insecure. Then I said anxiety and he went on and on about how I have no anxiety and its all just due to Youtube. This went on and on and I just stopped speaking. Like half an hour in, he told me that I should just take a knife and slice my wrists so I can die once and for all and how it would be great and he wouldnt give a shit This was pretty descriptive. He told me exactly where to cut and how much time it would take me to die. Also, to slice them in the bathroom sink so the bedroom doesnt get dirty After like 1.52 weeks after this convo, he came into my room and told me that he got irritated because he couldnt understand what caused me to do it and he had cried later that night. Now I dont know if I should believe him or not.",

I cant tell anyone about it besides my friend himself, nobody thinks here that online relationship can be real, if its either just friendship or a spark of love.

Even though its been a year, were exchanging pictures and we made phone calls and the risk still exists, but its limited, but they dont even want to think about it.

    "My depressed partner drains me tldr My partner has been depressed and not knowing what to do with his life for a long time. I am the only person he relys on for support and I cant bear it any longer. It starts to severely affect my own life quality and happiness. I 30f met my partner 32m at university eight years ago. He was a very fun, open and active guy with a huge social group. After two years of being friends we started dating. It was around that time that he was done with all his courses and papers and the only thing left for him to finish uni was to write his bachelors thesis. That didnt happen for another four years. Within that time he basically didnt do anything. Didnt write his thesis, didnt get a job. He told me, that he had no clue, what he wants to do with his life and I tried to encourage him to just do some internships to figure that out, but he never did. He is fortunate enough that his parents pay for his expenses always did and still do, so money wouldnt be the problem. He never did any internship. Fast forward six years and the situation is still the same. He did eventually finish his bachelors and started a masters degree but realized that studying just isnt for him. However he still isnt properly searching for jobs or internships or general input that would help him figure out, what he wants to do or be. The thing is, that his self esteem is lower than the mariana trench. He feels like he doenst know anything and is underqualified for basically every job. Hes not. Hes incredibly smart, attentive and detail orientated and has a great passion for social justice but he keeps telling himself that he isnt enough for any job and he doenst dare to apply. I dont know how to help him. All my affirmations seem to not penetrate his mindfog. However, the problem is that Im the only one hes talking to. Because he realized that all his peers moved on he stopped having contact with them because he was embarassed. So here is the thing.",

As a result, Im constantly miserable, and negative, and just... an asshole. And I hate it.

    "Should I keep checking in on a guy I dated for 4 months who disclosed he is depressed? I F28 have been single for 5 years and I know what assholes guys can be. But this boy was something else. Intiative, social, funny but deep down sweet and sensitive. He told me that winter gets to him and after a month he was starting to show signs of not sleeping and e.g. told that he didnt leave the house during the week but to go to supermarket. I started to get worried when he suddenly cancelled our weekend plans, and I said that it would be nice to know if he didnt want to see me anymore. He replied immediately that it wasnt about that and I told him to concact me again when hes feeling better. After a week he contacted me and I decided to give him another change. Then after a month he started to be again disconnected and finally I told him to come meet me and asked whats going on. He said that he has been feeling depressed for few years, but has now seeked for help. He hasnt told anyone else. I needed answers whether we had future together, which was maybe bad, since he had just come out of the depression closet for the first time ever... We decided that we wouldnt continue the dating. We both cried but I was pissed off due to the distant behavior that had been going on without excuses. I have now been texting him once a week. I started to get worried when he was saying that he hasnt really seen friends or doing anything. He still doesnt want to see me, even tho he said that some day he will when hes feeling better. His replies started to get more short and take more time. Now hes not answering every time. I asked if I was bothering him and that I could stop, but he sid that it wasnt about that. I asked if I could send him a text once a week that he would just open. He didnt reply. I have my own anxiety specially since we were dating and dont know whether I should keep texting him or not. There is mixed advice everywhere whether to not give up on a depressed or to give the person space. Sigh.",

    "Placing too much on outside help? Hello, I 20m am a Junior in college. I have dealt with social anxiety, self esteem issues, and most recently depression for nearly half my life. It was a result of reactionary behavior I caused my own problems and I have never been able to shake it, as I tell myself I am incapable of change. Cause yourself problems once, you will sure as hell cause them again I have been spiraling more or less over the last few years, and only now am I sane enough to look at my lifelong issues. Unfortunately, I recently moved to a new city where I know no one. The loneliness has recently gotten to my head, and that combined with the stressfulness of college has me incredibly overwhelmed. Suicide has been on my mind more and more lately until I told myself today I would do it. But here I am. I have an appointment with a therapy clinic lined up on 59 May 9th  USA, but I do feel guilty to an extent. All that goes through my head upon dealing with my problems is tell the therapist and they will assist you in making sense of it. This has me feel irresponsible and ridiculous. There has been many people in life who cant afford help and have gotten along just fine. Its your life, and at the end of the day its on you to fix it. Yet at the same time I am so lost. All that goes through my head is my inner critic, saying its pointless. Sorry to ramble. My point being, those who have had success beating their issues on their own, what techniquesroutinesactivities did you use  partake in? What helped change your perspectives?

    "I wrote my letters To start it am safe, I am not planning on ending my life for now. I wrote my letters today. I wanted to see what I would say to my loved ones. They were surprisingly easy to write. 5 total. My exwife, 2 friends and my parents. The ones to my parents were the hardest. I know they are what had kept me alive as long as I have been. I dont want them to have to bury me. That is not a burden I want them to have. But having these letters written does give me some relief in knowing that if I cant hold back the pain anymore that they will know that I did my best and that they were wonderful parents. And that it was not because of them I am gone. That it was because of them I lived as long as I did. That my pain became too much but not because if them. It was my internal demons. So they will know that I held out as long as I could. so I have to keep going for now. So they will never see that letter. But knowing it is there if I cant keep it away in the future is a relief.",
    "In love with my best friend who doesn’t see me like that. So Iv known this guy for over two years now and the moment I met him I started to fall for him. We are both mid 30s and have a real connection. We actually met from a online hook up at the beginning and he ended up staying here for a few nights, but after a week when I asked him for a date he said he wanted to stay friends as that was more important. I still remember how much it broke my heart then when he rejected me, but we hung out nearly every day. He stayed at my place most of the time and we just became really close. We sleep together whenever we stay at each others places, just cuddling. Over the years I have fallen deeper for him and I had already suffered with my own mental health before all this but now I feel so torn. He is literally my one and only friend, Im terrified of having another talk about my feelings with him in case I push him away again. We didnt speak for a few months as he wasnt very understanding that I couldnt stop loving him. I cried every single day when we stopped talking and this was during lockdown last year. It was awful, I think about him all the time and I have a lot of trouble sleeping with my mind just racing. Mostly When Im with him I genuinely feel myself and happy, but then I always wish for more. I dont know what to do, I feel like if i stepped away again from our friendship I wouldnt last. Its not that I want to end my life, but for awhile now I just wish I was dead. He keeps me tethered here, so I dont know do I just hide my feelings and say nothing and hope the friendship works. I would have been a very outgoing, proactive and positive person but I dont feel that anymore. I burst out crying a few times a day about my life, I dont really sleep, I cant really eat which isnt good cause Im already v skinny. Over the past few years Iv lost many friends to suicide so I know how terrible it is, but lately I really find myself understanding why they did it and tbh I dont have the guts to go through with it.",

Still, I cant help but think I am worthless and pathetic and that if I dont marry before the age of 25 no man will want me.

I have traditional values and hate that this generation is so into the hookup culture that perpetuates feeling used up as a way of empowerment.

I didnt confront the issue till I was 24 and a girlfriend that I used to talk to and sort of wanted something more were talking about our feelings and I just plained told her what had happened to me and she told me that something similar happened to her at a similar age, we cried and talked about it and other things, strangely even as we felt closer after this we went our separate ways being just good friends to this day she is married, lives in a different country and has a baby, after that I worked through my trauma alone with little success side note, there is a history of violent tendencies in the men of my family, both from my mothers and fathers side, and Im basically the mixed result.",
    "Looked in the mirror I have run into 2 major problems in my life atm, it has been eating away at me for the better part of a month. Ill give you some backstory I have people pleaser all my life. I feel like I have always gone with the flow, with peoples expectations of me rather than have my own. I have done that since I was a kid and Im now turning 20 this year, And with that being said the first problem I have run into is, I dont know what I want and like partly due to the depression. But mostly due to the fact that Ive never really done or said what I wanted to to outside forces shutting me down at every turn school, parents etc.. Idk and its driving me up a wall. 2 I thought hard about the people pleaser trait in my being a lot and I have come to this conclusion, I hate who I am. I believe that I am selfish and feel because I havent done what I have wanted in my life I am inauthentic. So I go and look for outside validation and love because I feel like I am incapable of it. But when I receive it, and it doesnt hit the way I wanted it to or things are too fast or far. Like a addict I dump them and look for a new person to give me that feeling I long for. Its fucked up, because the other people care about me and I do to to an extent, but I prioritize my own feelings and shit first. And that realization fucked me up so bad. Real bad. Any thoughts would be great because Im so lost rn. Thanks",
    "Could you read me? So, since I was a child I was really close and sometimes, hyper protected to my momand the only other child company that I had was my brother, who is 3 years older than me. My brother is gay, and since always have been very feminine, and we used to play imitating pop singers and famous women. So I start to grew really feminine, but pay attention, IM NOT SAYING THAT THE FACT THAT I WAS FEMININE IS BAD. But when I went to school, the thing was not pretty. I spent the years of 4  11 being extremely rejected by my male colleagues and being accused of wanting to be a woman and being gay. Sometimes I was interested in playing soccer like the other boys, but I knew that I would be bullied Everytime I was feminine which was all the time. And these masculine activities would always have been a strange thing for me. My father was really interested in soccer, but never talk to me about it and my mother always rejected soccer just like every other thing my father liked. My brother... Not interested. But I would still play with him of imitate female singers and sometimes, put a fake dress into us. It was pretty much this dynamic until 2010, when I was 9. My brother and I were still playing this, until, in some moment, he started to touch my penis and put my hands on his penis. Im not gonna lie, I knew something wrong was happening, but I didnt actually think about it as sex. I didnt even knew what sex was, until the moment that he lay in the couch and put his penis, expecting me to blow it. Obviously, only now I realised that he wanted me to do oral sex on him, but at the time I didnt really know what he was wanting me to do. So I just stand there, paralized and nervously laughing. Later, he went to my front and put his butt in my penis and start dancing with it. I just felt so uncomfortable but couldnt get out, for some reason. I just remember crying hard at that night, just very disturbed. I just remember this fact very recently, with therapy. Since then it was just blocked from my mind.",
    "Should I? First time posting and on my phone, sorry about the format. Im 27f at a breaking point with my depression and anxiety. Im a stay at home mom with two kids and my husband works all the time. The last couple of weeks or so Ive been angry, constantly angry about everything and I cant pinpoint the cause of it. A friend told me I was angry because of depression. Ive been fighting with it for my entire life and today Ive considered getting antidepressants...but for some reason Im so, so scared because my whole life Ive been taught that theyre for crazy people or itll change me completely and Ill always be dependent on a pill to be happy and never be able to be happy on my own without it. I know it sounds really stupid...but I just need advice as to wether or not I should finally just get them. Will they really help me?? TIA",
    "I have a problem with getting mental help. If anything cant be solved within a minute or two, they wont hardly even look in its direction. Im near graduating, so its not like Im just some middle schooler looking for attention. Im actually a bit concerned about my mental help, and some of the people Ive talked to as well, but at this point, I just dont know how to get that help. Any advice?",
    "I'm at my end point. I feel so alone and like no one cares about me, I have no one to turn to for reassurance or comfort in these very difficult times. Other people have friends and family but I have no one. Suicide phone lines dont help me one bit and besides, Ive called too much at this point and I consider myself a nuisance to them. Ive attempted to make friends but I always ruin it or theyre not interested and ghost me, let me tell you, being thosed or ignored is one of the worst feelings when youre lonely and trying to reach out for that human connection. I dont know whats wrong with my generation or society as a whole, it seems empathy has gone out of fashion with my generation or it went extinct.",
    "I'm losing my mind and need help. I contemplate suicide everyday. I don't see any future anymore, just think I'll kill myself one of these days. Everything makes me irritated, or break down. Noise seemed to be the problem. Voices make me go mad, but even when Im alone and in silence I keep thinking about everything needing to shut up. The chatter is all inside my head, and it never stops. ampx200B I feel like sometimes I am already dead on the inside, and Im not really human. Just a shell o what I wanted to be. I started going out to partys and things, mostly just filling myself with alcohol, or Ill just drive around going as fast as I can. Hoping Ill be something else, hoping Ill feel. Ive had one relationship with a girl, that eventually ended. I loved her but after that I couldnt feel anything for anyone and no, not even her. I just ended up obsessing over her, even if I didnt feel a thing. Really tried after I started to get over her, and even tried with another girl, but even with all that I managed to bosses with her as well, and got called a creep and that I harassed her. The meds make me worse off. My sex drive is completely dead. ampx200B By the end of high school I have made some friends, but I end up isolating myself, and losing them. Im starting college in August, and Ill move to another city for that, but I fear that will only isolate me, and make me worse. I think that if I dont kill myself soon, Ill do it then. I see no real future past a certain point. I fear itll all colapse, and Ill truly break down. I fear Ill lose interest in my career, since it has already happened. I was going to study astrophysics, but after an episode I saw nothing in that. ampx200B Im going crazy, always suffering. Everyday is pain, and I just want it to end. I am sick.",
    "I feel irritated all the time and it gets worse when I try to study something. Currently recovering from anxiety and extreme amounts of stress. I feel slightly irritated all the time. When I am listening to nonsense podcastsjokes, random nonsense, wrestling then I feel ok. When I try to listen to an audiobook or a podcast where I have to pay attention I get very irritated and tired. I also feel stressed. Yesterday this irritation got so bad that I felt it was hard to contain it. It feels like pain and burning in my head. I am currently not working due to sick leaves. I will be seeing my psychologist tomorrow. Any suggestions? Any food or activity that would help me?",
    "Not sure what to do anymore. Throwaway because I guess Im embarrassed to admit this. Ive been dealing with persistent depressive disorder for the past 10 years, in and out of therapy in currently, on and off of meds off currently, and I just have no idea what to do anymore. At best, I can function, but by the time Im there, Im too exhausted to try to improve or make my life better beyond just functioning. Recently, some external life events have really made it hard to even reach functioning. I blame myself for everything and no matter how much I talk through it with others, I cant seem to forgive myself, even if theres not much to forgive in the first place. Is this the best I can do? Is this the best life has to offer for me? Just... functioning? I dont know what to do anymore, I feel like Ive tried everything, and it makes me want to give up. Advice is more than welcome.",
    "I've lost all of my friends So I just lost all of my friends because I overreacted on a dumb little thing. One of my best friends just recently ended our relationship and the rest from my group of friends ignore me, I fucked up pretty badly. Its because they offered me attention, affection, they helped me a lot of times, and Ive done nothing in return. They dont respond to my messages anymore and we are all classmates. I dont know what to do, I dont think I can do anything about it",
    "I am falling off track of everything I am 28 , graduated 5 months back and havent found a job yet . I have been rejected after multiple final rounds . Now its come to the point where I dont believe things will work out . Not comparing but cant stop thoughts of being scared for myself , when I hear everyone in my batch has a job . I used to be a person who would wake up before sunrise , eat healthy , read books and learn new things . I was someone who would never skip a workout , eat only clean foods , meditate every day and take care of my skin. Now, I dont get out of my bed and dont even look forward to the next day , cos its the same thing on loop , pushing myself to apply for jobs with no belief in whatever I am doing . I miss my workouts and feel lazy to cook for myself , I will order food from a restaurant often which does not feel good after eating at all . I can not do anything other that eating and sleeping . I miss the old me , I used to be a very strong woman . People used to compliment me for my mental strength. I have been through a lot in the past and have overcome it but this time I am unable to get myself back . I dont know this me . Above all this , I live with a roommate who for some reason enjoys when I get rejected from an interview. I have seen that on his face . Even when he knows that I didnt get the job he would on purpose ask me again how did my interview go . Other than that he cares about nothing , and has a very weird vibe . He talks about me to his friends, I dont even know these people and when they come home , they literally know each and everything about me . And to add to this, I feel the need for someone to tell me that I am good enough but I dont get it . I seek that from my father but he is just worried that if I will find a job or not . He doesnt say that out loud but I can read that from our conversations , so I dont feel like speaking at home . I dont know whats so wrong with me that I can just lose myself like this . I want me back .",
    "How do I muster the energy to cook and eat, especially at the end of the day? Does anyone have tips or psychological tricks for getting yourself to eat regularly, especially at dinner? Im pretty good about eating on days when I have classes college student. I always eat before class so I can be energetic and focused and because stomach grumbles are embarrassing. I always have a healthy big breakfast. My problem is with weekends and dinner. Im usually mentally tuckered out after classes and interacting with people and rush to get home. When I come home, all I can do is curl up in my bed and maybe do homework in bed. Even doing something small like changing into PJs and brushing my teeth is very tough. Taking time to prep food and eat it is just a lot of mental effort, even if its just microwaving leftovers. I also live with others  I feel safe in my room but going into the kitchen is leaving my safety zone. My roommates are great but at the end of the day I really dont want to see anyone except maybe my best friend. When he comes over for dinner on occasion I feel motivated to cook and eat, but he usually has evening classes or work so I cant always rely on his presence. Or if Im out with friends and were getting fast food I can eat because I dont have to put in any effort and Im outside anyways. And weekends are really tough because I hate leaving my room just for food and I dont feel the same need to eat without classes to attend or things to do. So I end up eating one very hasty big meal of sandwiches or something when I get really hungry. Can anyone relate? Any psychological tricks people have for making themselves eat and get ready for bed? When I was living with family someone would usually tug me to the dinner table at night, but no one does that to me in college  I find it difficult to stay at a healthy weight for this reason. Its really easy to drop a few pounds when Im under additional stress some weeks I just cant do dinners at all.",
    "Looking For Coping Methods My depression has been really declining lately. I live in a really bad household and Im being targeted by my grandfather whom nobody will stand up to and if I try to stand up for myself, Im the one in the wrong. Hes been yelling at me over small things, calling me all sorts of names, leaving stuff at my door for me to trip over, and more. This especially hurts because him and I used to be friends when my mother was the one being horrible and nasty She calls me disgusting, a few slurs, etc he was the one that was always there to comfort me and try and talk it out with her. Now, however, it feels like that never happened. It feels like I was the one who did something wrong, and I dont know what. Its seriously effecting my relationship with my boyfriend, friends, and myself. Its an incredible struggle to eat just a meal a day, my lips are getting torn because I pick at them, I cant ever get to sleep and stay asleep, its frustrating and since Im a teenager I cant leave this enviroment. What do I do to cope? I use music to try and melt away, I play games like animal crossing to stay distracted, I draw, I play ukulele, I just breathe and try to remember that it will pass. Im terrified of being suicidal, Ive attempted once and was lucky I know Im capable even if I dont want to and that scares me. What are some methods you guys use to deal with these sort of things? I desperately want to get better, but it feels like I cant here.",
    "I hate my body and my thoughts Ever since I was little I was always struggling with my physical appearance. I have been told throughout my life that I was overweight and that just screwed over my image even more. Here I am feeling guilty cause I had a bit of grill chicken and honestly Im just tired. Im tired of thinking of exercise as a mere chore. Im tired that I cant enjoy food anymore, and the fact that my mom cooks so much doesnt help. My family all says Im lean and normal but I feel so disfigured. My shoulders are too broad and my arms are flappy making me look twice my size, my thighs are gigantic and are covered with cellulite. I really hate my mirrors and if I could break them I would. My weight is always in the middle of normal or overweight and one slice of cake could tip it off. Ive been active and even trying to just eat healthy foods but I still hate myself. I think my thoughts have screwed over and long for the underweight body. At this point I think normal looks fat.",
    "Hair loss The past year of my life has been a rollercoaster of hell type emotions. I have went through a lot and my hair seems to be paying for it. About 5 months ago, my hair started shedding like crazy. It wasnt as bad as the previous month. Everytime I touch my hair I lose about 1015 strands. I have never had hair loss as great as this and I suspect it has to do with my depression and anxiety. Are there any tips and tricks I can use to salvage my hair ?",
    "Back on the meds Back on the Prozac amp Abilify... I know its for the best. I know I have a medical condition that needs treatment. At least thats what my therapist says. That made me feel better for a little while, but I cant help feeling a little resentful as I swallow the pills. Why cant I just reason my way through the sadness? Why cant I just see the hope through the pit of despair? Why cant having it all fill the huge gaping hole? Why do I have to let myself hit the bottom before I can decide I need to stick to the plan? Why with forums like this and such a greater openness about mental health do I still feel so alone? Nothings seems worth it. I cant even bring myself to cry about it. That seems worthless too. Its getting harder to fake it and push through. Being an adult only makes me want to run and hide more. Theres always so much to do, but I cant anymore. Then I think of my little family and I feel so much guilt that I could think about leaving them. But I do, I think about my end so much it scares me.",
    "Should I tell any crisis hotline about my suicidal thoughts? I have been having suicidal thoughts for months. I feel I do not want to talk to any of my friends or families anymore because Im hurting them by being depressed. They are supportive but a lot of them cried and my parents get depressed too because Im depressed. Therapy and medication has not been helpful. I might try intensive outpatient programs. I do not know what to do anymore. I text some crisis line sometimes but when they ask me about suicidal thoughts I always say no. Because Im afraid that they will disclose this to my school and when my school knows about this its very troublesome as I have experienced. Or they will call the police to come over.",
    "I need help communicating with my depressed wife. I love my wife. I really do. It breaks my heart that our ability to communicate has broken down entirely. Everything I say runs through a negativity filter and gets interpreted as personal attack. Seriously. Ive been told Im too logical. Which might have some situtational truth to it. Not all conversations call for logic, and I probably do apply these processes to more wishywashy, emotional conversations than I should. But Im working on not always trying to be Mr. Fixit. That I overthink and analyze things that dont need to be analyzed. Which I think I know what shes getting at, but Im unaware of any problem that was solved by not analyzing possible solutions. I know not every complaint is a request for a fix. But when its a constant refrain of complaint for weeks or months, maybe its time I tried to help alleviate? And that I talk too much and dont listen. So I make active efforts to listen and say nothing. Even when painful and untrue accusations are flung at me. Like supposed infidelity or that I dont love her anymore because her depression has caused her to gain a few pounds by over indulging on icecream. Even when I feel like I should tell her those ideas and accusations are not only unhelpful, but deeply untrue, and hurtful to me, I just take them on the chin, because when I have attempted to reassure her of their falseness, in the past, that I still love her, thats taken as needless contradiction and proof that I dont listen. In response to these accusations, Ill respond something like, Okay, Ill just listen then. How does that make you feel? And I get the angry response of, See!? Just like that! Youve always got an answer for everything! I have to be missing some piece. How can I promise to only listen, and ask a question, and by the time it gets to her ears, it has mutated into an antagonistic criticism or correction. I feel like Im totally locked into a Twilight Zone episode. How do I communicate with someone that will reject the behavior they just asked for?",
    "I feel like im worthless and alone. Please help I posted this on another sub but I couldnt crosspost. Im just looking for help. Im 19 almost 20 and i feel like Ive accomplishment nothing in life at all. My story is the following. I was born in Mexico to a single mother and brought to the US when i was one year old. My mom got married to this man and every since I have memory this man has treated me terribly. Ive been told that he treated me well I was a baby but I dont remember any of it. I used to be beaten almost everyday by this man and its left scars in my mental state. He would beat me for the most absurd things. He beat me because i didnt all my multiplications, he beat me because I couldnt hold a chicken while he killed the poor thing, he beat me because I wasnt strong enough to help him do some mechanic things. He would tell me that I was useless and worthless. This has left a pretty big scar. And the worst thing of all is that mom wouldnt do anything and i didnt know why. I thought everyone just hated me. I just want someone to tell me that they are proud of me. Im going to college, I have a job, I have a girlfriend that I love, Im paying my rent and bills but even though I do have all of this I still feel worthless and useless. I feel alone and unwanted, hated by everyone. This leaves me to sob alone in the night because I dont know if even deserve living. This has lead to many attempt suicides.

He is 20, however never grew up or matured properly due to lack of socialization... Never experience love, only had friends before his teens and made virtual friends via his gaming on Xbox until this day... While my mom drank and my dad was aggressive all these years, my brother would go hide in his room gaming all night and sleping all day and hasnt left his room until child protective services took him out for 1.5 years. And they only did because I told them what was going on... Anyways. Fast forward and now he is finally with me. I want to be the best support but I havent stopped feeling anxiety since he moved in. Like I am not eating as well and I am worried this will make me feel isolated or ruin my other relationships  dont have many left haha but 23 but also worried for him too as he wont eat unless I tell him to, wont move his body unless I tell him to etc... Having him here reminds me of the misery of my parents and my childhood. Because he is unfortunately the result of a dysfunctional family.

Before coming to stay with me he was starring to refuse food and had severe psychomotor retardation  cant get our of bed  and like I maybe mentioned before he has not gotten out of bed in a decade expect for when CPS got involved .

I have nobody. ampx200B I ended up in a string of very abusive relationships, got engaged to a man who left me no choice... All the while, I was talking about all of this with my best friend. He was so supportive, so wonderful... I was going to move to the US again, coerced and manipulated into it but I had to meet my best friend first, as it was our one and only chance of meeting in person. So I flew over to Norway to be with him and hang out for 3 days. Nothing happened. Nothing at all... but it was obvious we both wanted it to. He gave me the strength to leave my abusive fiance Who by this point had sent death threats and abusive messages to said best friend and all my other friends, threatened to kill himself and his 3 year old daughter if I didnt move over there. I became a target for abuse from his family after we split up.",
    "I hate myself, i need an outside perspective. I feel like a complete failure at everything i do. Everyone in my life says im so talented or that im smart or have potential but every time i hear someone say that it makes me want to shoot myself in the fucking face. Whenever i hear these things my ego just gets bigger and it gives me a reason to think  Maby im not so bad which i then immediately disprove by doing some other stupid shit, i cant get get relationships right, im pretty sure my girlfriend is slowly loosing interest in me, and i dont blame her, i would too. Im not good at sex and fail to pleasure my partner, im terrible at work and am constantly overshadowed by new employees despite my seniority, im failing all my classes at school and i havnt spoken to my friends at all recently due to a lack of motivation. I feel like im looking in on the world from outside a glass door, and i hate it, i hate myself, i hate every decision that i make, will make, or have made, and i wish nothing but the worst upon myself. Im at a point where i do all of these things and feel no remorse, i feel no sadness, im just an empty sad excuse for a man looking for my next momentary shot of dopamine to keep me from loosing my mind and realizing what a piece of shit i am. Thanks for your time.",
    "Am I a disappointment?? So, Ive been on tinder for some time now. I have match with several girls and had a conversation with only 2. Each one Ive talked, it seemed like that they might have an interest in me, but that may be the desperation in me since Ive never had a date or girlfriend in my 21 years of existence. After some time passes, they both just completely stop talking to me like I dont exist. I feel like once they stop talking to me, they think Im just another random person. All I want is one girl to date and do stuff with. Im not trying to get into their pants. I personally think that Im a huge disappointment, even tho I have a lot of potential in life.",
    "I've been feeling this way for some tine Im alway feeling like this. It doesnt even matter the age we are anymore. When we are feeling low its just that. Ive been dealing with depressionanxiety since I was 1213. It comes with just a long story that I was never able to overcome it. I tried to seek help and when she tried to suggest medication since I was already angry I just never went back. I just got to a point where I just say Im ok when asked HOW ARE YOU? Its just easier to say Im ok, than explaining how I feel. night time is the worst for me since Im alone in my room. Ive tried to text people that I was once able to do, but that turned out wrong for me so I guess I dont have that option anymore. Ive done things in the past where I am trying to avoid but as selfish as that may sound to others I found my comfort in that. I dont want to do that anymore. Finally admitted to myself that I cannot do this anymore by myself. This whole year has been a night mare for me but I still tried and I feel like kept falling deeper and deeper. Like being in a coma but with my eyes open. Like being in a crowded room and yet Im still feeling alone, boxed in, no way out. Ive become so afraid of being alone, that I am alone. Lost valuable friends, a great partner and I cannot get any of it back. I held back on telling people how I feel with the fear of losing anyone else. But that hold inside me makes it worse and I know that, but I dont want to lose anyone else. I dont know if I would, but that thought is just there. I feel as if I sleep walk awake. Sorry it just been to much. My heart beats fast, with just even writing this my head hurts from it all. I want to tell people how I feel the ones matter, but its that fear that hold me back. Dont know why or where this all came from but its been even harder to get myself together. Maybe I deserve to be alone. I deserve to not have you as my friend.",
    "Teenager with no hope. Im a senior in high school right now, and as far as I can tell, I have a bleak future, and an even bleaker present. Im too lazy to get grades better than Cs, and my social life is worse than an 80 year old retiree with a dead spouse and estranged children. I feel as if my default state is depressed, with small bouts of happiness, then back into the trenches for me. I keep thinking Ive found happiness in the love of someone else, only for it to be stomped out and kicked until I taste the blood. I can make people laugh and they seem as if they like me, but when the school day ends and everyone goes home, no one calls, no one texts, and I doubt anyone thinks of me. Its gotten so bad, I dont even like to listen to music anymore, something I used to look forward to a little while ago, now it just seems like unnecessary noise. Every time someone asks what college Im going to and I reply with X Community College, I see the disappointment in their eyes. It seems as if everyone else has these nice lives, and the perfect SO. Dont get me wrong, Ive had girlfriends, but they never lasted long and ultimately didnt mean much to either person. I know they say having an SO just causes more strife and pain, but I just want to see what a proper relationship is like and experience the life everyone else talks about. I know this story has been told before by countless people before me, and will be told by countless people after me. I just want to escape all of this. Im not suicidal yet, but I fear what comes next. Wow, I sound like a pretentious asshole reading this back. I just want to know if anyone else has experienced this, and what you did. Or atleast, something I could do to help myself. I will now check my phone every ten seconds hoping for a reply. What a life.",
    "I think I'm inching closer towards being suicidal Im at my significant others place but that does not mean much. We called an Uber from a rave here and I vomited on my way here. My so could only take three people including themselves home so initially I wasnt meant to come because my so gave priority to my other drunk friends. Youd think theyd try to prioritize me by asking my friends if they could by any chance go home safely, but no I had to. Now I was left on the couch so I cant even sleep next to someone anyways. Theyre so fucking cold sometimes, I dont think they love me. Its 5am and I have cuts on my arm I impulsively made, I feel like death",
    "How to get over not dating? I was diagnosed with mental illness bipolar, anxiety and something causing halucinations. It does not affect my intelligence but does keep me from working and on disability. due to these and medication Im taking for them im most likely going to be stuck in this situation for life. I know this is no situation to be dating in but its hard to get over the loneliness. I tried just ignoring it and that didnt work. How do I get over it? Or is it just more Im gonna have to pile on?",

    "The Story of This Year I cried everyday, I never left my room, I avoided everything and everyone. There was parties in my house and I just laid in my room and cried while the world went by. It may sound ridiculous but I havent had a great life and the smallest things get to me. After the month, I kinda got over the overdose and went about my days. Life started getting a bit better again, there were more smiles and laughter. One of my house mates during the time we lived together was terrible with money. He gets paid at 1230am every Sunday and goes out every Saturday night so usually he spends all his pay as soon as it comes in on drinks. Because of this, my room mates and I had to cover his rent and food throughout the week. This lasted for a few months. Things started getting worse with the guy, he gets very angry and started masking his problems with drugs specifically weed. He would go out everyday and get really high so he didnt have to deal with his problems, my room mates and I were getting very broke trying to support him and it got to the point we couldnt anymore. He never paid us back after countless promises and he never did anything around the house. One night we got into a massive fight and I kicked him out, we stayed friends and we spoke all the time and we learnt it was better this way. We became closer not living together because we didnt have the tension and added stress. Im sorry this story jumps a lot, theres so much content that I cant really focus I didnt realise till after I kicked him out how much I spent time with him. My other two room mates were sleeping together since the start and they would spend 60 of their time in bed. Because of this, the room mate I kicked out and I got really close because we only had each other. After kicking him out I was very lonely. I dont deal well with being alone and I constantly need company so I feel okay. The male room mate out of the 2 that were sleeping together ended up finding another girl he liked and he spent a lot of time with her which left me and the girl to get very close.",
    "Complete recovery after depression is a realistic expectation? I also got fired right before Christmas for sleeping too much at work and doing almost nothing because of my depression, but I wasnt even mad about it. I mean, I cried because crying was like my main occupation along with sleeping and because I knew thats what Im supposed to do when I get fired but I didnt really feel much about that event. In January I went in a trip to New York with one of my best friends and I enjoyed every moment of it! Then I came home and started looking for a new job. I was so relaxed and carefree and I was becoming my old self again. In February I started a new job and shortly after that I stopped my antidepressants treatment. But I feel like this journey of becoming my old self again is never going to be complete. Sometimes I get close to what I used to be before this whole thing but I cant sustain that, like the oldhappyme is visiting sometimes but she doesnt wanna stay. Even though things go great for me now great new job, great old friends, new healthy romantic relationship I am mostly anxious and scared. I cant be genuinely happy with the good things I have in my life, because the fear of losing them and going straight back into depression is overwhelming. I heard things like youll never go back to what you used to be before depression, depression leaves a scar youll have to live with your entire life, depression is a part of growing up, you just cant go back. I am starting to believe these things and its sad. Are they true? I have no chance to going back to my old self?",
    "What would be the best way to talk to my S.O. about getting help tomorrow when it's a really upsetting subject for her even though she needs it? Ok, so me and my S. O. are both 15, I am a male and she is a female if that helps at all. Recently, my S. O. has been getting worse and worse and blocking outgetting rid of anyone or anything that helps her or makes her happy and Im extremely worried about her. She took up cutting about 2 years prior, even back then I knew her and did all I could, but eventually it came down to me calling the authorities to save her when she threatened to kill herself one night and her parents sent her to a mental hospital for awhile, which yes, while it did make her stop when she got out for awhile the things she got away with and did in there are absolutely horrible and Im disgusted by the way mental hospitals go about helping their patients. So anyways, recently she picked it back up again, Id say about a month to a month and a half ago. Ive been doing everything in my power to help her stop and I got her to for like 1 maybe 2 weeks at most before an event occurred in which she got her phone taken away by her parents and started it up again because I couldnt be there for her. She also most likely has an eating disorder, I say this because one moment she is eatingsnacking just chillin, the next shes throwing it all up and going days on end without eating. Shes claimed it has nothing to do with being fat shes under 90 pounds but yet she still brings up eating like a pug or not wanting to get fat so I assume that may be her reasoning but it could be more. She tells her parents who are doing a very shit job at looking after their daughter btw that shes just not feeling well or she pretends to eat and gets away with it.",
    "Making the same mistake years later. Hello, sorry for a long post. Ill try to keep it as short as possible. Thank you for whoever reads this. Ill start with events 4 years ago when it all started. I am 22 year old male. I used to work in a bar where I met a girl I instantly fell in love with . We got to know each other well, went on dates etc. She was everything I ever wished for. Im from a small village and I have some good friends here. We were always considered to be the bad guys because we partied a lot etc. I never done drugs thought. She always assumed I do drugs and one day I decided to take some to impress her  stupid I know I guess to keep up with the bad guy reputation. Problem is, I fell in love with cocaine. And thats when my life went into a downwards spiral. I started taking cocaine for breakfast everyday. I turned it an angry mess, our relationship slowly got ruined. I was angry at her one day and tried sleeping with her best friend. I was nothing but a scumbag. I was a cheating, lying scumbag. I didnt see that at the time but now its very clear for me to see. She deserved better than me After overdosing once, We broke up and she moved away. I decided I had enough and went sober. I went through some very rough time then. I was very deeply hurt and depressed. Day by day it got better. 4 years have passed and I still never fully got over her even when I was with other girls but I was living more or less fine. I dont really like this town but I have some great friends and reasonably good new job. Anyway, after all these years, last weekend I was out drinking with friends and I met an old friend who offered me a bag of cocaine for some reason i snapped back to my old habits and bought a bag. I knew she was back in town, later on I ended up at a house party where I got in to a very bad state with drugs and alcohol.",

    "I am very lonely and my house mate bangs his girlfriend every day behind my wall. I am 39, trying to cope with my depression. It was triggered by being alone for 2 years, after 9 year long relationship. I am frustrated as fuck and my hose mate fucks his sexy girlfriend every day in the next room. I am dying inside. I am well built, smart, have passions and interesting job but still cant make any connections with women. But I would be able to live with that, maybe even fix it, but now I am locked with two horny people in one house and I want to blow my brains out. metaphorically speaking so far. Headphones help a bit, but its not only about noises as you guys might guess. I cant stand their happiness, it just reminds me of what I am missing out on. I cant be happy for them, and it only makes me think worse about myself. They are looking for a new place but it might take months. Same for me if I want to move out. I am scared of loneliness. I need some sex but it dose not work for me with prostitutes. I tried Tinder and other stuff, no real results and I am loosing hope with every day passing. I mean I am now talking to a bunch of strangers on the internet to flush some of my frustration away and get advice. I started therapy but it is too early to say if it helps.

They started as instrusive thoughts and now they bring comfort. I live in a small town, surrounded by other small towns and there arent many options when it comes to mental health.

    "Things just keep getting worse On the background check it says I was sentenced to jail  I wasnt, but might even been for failure to pay the fines. There may be warrants out for my arrest for failure to pay the fines, I dont know. They still havent told me what additional information they need, but I dont really think it could be anything but that. I feel like my mistakes and being poor the past few years are going to prevent me from ever getting a job and making things better. Ive made mistakes, Ive paid for them, Ive learned from them. But I just havent been able to pay the fines. Even if they decide to give me the job, I have doubts theyll have me start next Monday since people will be off for Thanksgiving. So I wouldnt even start working til Dec. and wouldnt get a paycheck until Dec. 15. And this job is remote and I cant work from home once the power is cut off. I dont have anybody I can ask for any type of help. And Im really feeling pretty hopeless right now. Its literally taken me years to get this 1 job offer and its looking like it isnt going to happen. I just dont see how things can get better when it looks like things are definitely going to get worse. I could use the public WiFi somewhere like the library, but I dont know how I could do that while being on Zoom calls for most of the day. Even with a headset Id still be bothering others when Im talking. If youve got a better idea of what I could do for a few weeks, please let me know.

    "Step son quit working &amp; refuses help My stepson has some undiagnosed mental issues along with anxiety and depression. A couple months ago he lost his job because he wasnt showing up to work. I know he makes a few dollars here and there but Im not sure how. He never leaves his house and he refuses any help mans mother offer him unless my wife just offers to give him cash.

    "Specific activities to ease loneliness and depression while living alone in the time of COVID? I 23F have been living alone since ending a 4year emotionally abusive relationship in October 2019. I loved my new independence, then quarantine hit. I went through another horrific breakup in March  he broke up with me in a truly cruel way the day before the shelterinplace order hit. My best friends have all moved 100s of miles away to be with their parents during quarantine. After 82 days of basically solitary confinement, I started hanging out safely with acquaintances in June and I visit my parents almost every weekend. Im trying dating apps, but the constant ghosting, mixed signals, and not getting matches is really bringing me down. I have had depression, anxiety, and OCD for 10 years but in quarantine its the worst Ive ever felt. I am an attractive woman, but no one wants to date me and everyone Ive ever dated has either been emotionally abusive or lied to me to get to my body. When I do meet someone who expresses interest, they inevitably ghost me. I just got a prescription for Zoloft because my Citalopram is clearly not working anymore. I am hoping to feel better on Zoloft, but I dont have much hope. A medication will not give me friends, or make men interested in me, or open up all my favorite places that have closed due to the pandemic. Because my depression stems from my unfortunate life circumstances, I am seeking advice on specific things I can do to pass the time and take my mind off of how sht my life is right now. Especially how I can meet other people and hopefully make friends. When everything that I love to do is closed, what can I do to make myself feel happy? BTW, I cannot watch television or movies besides documentaries because it is too painful to see happy people, even if they are fictional.",
    "I know what I have to do but I don’t want to do it I know I should exercise, get up early and eat better but I just dont feel like it. For about 2 weeks I was up, feeling competent getting shit done and trying To ingrain the feeling in myself of how much better it felt. I know it and I just cant bring myself to do things again. Im so frustrated because I want immediate results from exercising, Im tired of not being fit but I cant stand how theres no results for a long long time. Ugh!!!! !",
    "I'm getting angry at my depression. I want to break out of it and I can't seem to shake it. I wasnt able to complete homework because of mental fog and everytime I opened my online class dashboard I would break down and cry until I fell asleep. I did a few assignments and it would take me half the day to write a 2 page paper. Took me a week to write a 6 page paper. I used to be able to do them in a few hours. I feel like my mind is deteriorating. Conversation is more difficult. I can easily explain my feelings because its a trait of my personality, but casual talk and reading people has become impossible. Im getting anxious because talking to people I already know is starting to feel like talking to strangers. Ive been crying my eyes out over small insecurities I used to be over and accept. Im trying to figure out how to reorganize my life but its so hard. I know people who go out and party and drink night after night and still go to college and go to work and are doing great. They are happy and healthy and only have a small nagging guilt about not getting more done. I feel like I produce NOTHING of value to the world and its so difficult to just chip away at learning a song or doing a simple assignment or task at work. All I can listen to is super depressing music as well if I want to enjoy it. I feel like a emo highschooler. My whole life Ive struggled with motivation, my parents called me a lazy piece of shit everyday and its true. Everything takes so much mental effort for me and I can barely focus because my mind goes a million miles an hour with intense imagery and nonsensical logic. To slow it down and focus on the world around me, especially the physical world, is a manual effort. The depression just makes it all the worse. I just want to know if anyone might relate and how they may have improved their lives? Ive been feeling so isolated even though I surround myself with people lately, and there are less and less reasons I want to stay around.",
    "Need help figuring out alternative reasons why I'm experiencing excessive sleep, extreme tiredness, low energy, no motivation but stable mood Id like to get a better idea before I go to the Dr. I brought up the possibility of doing a sleep study, but she said they probably wont be able to do much about excessive sleep, its mostly for people having trouble getting or staying asleep. But she said ifwhen my primary Dr rules out any nondepression related reason Im so tired constantly, she could refer me to a sleep specialist. Im sorry for the godawful formatting and thank you again!",
    "suicide hi. pretty much the thing is everything is going downhill Im seriously considering commuting suicide. I already have multiple plans and locations chosen. I dont have a phone number or any sort of texting device I can use in private. I havent told my parents that I think I need to seek psychological attention. Theyre constantly judging me and taking away things that are extremely important to me and pretty much keep the mental strain in check. I still havent gotten diagnosed with anything but I wanna be able to share my thoughts. Does anybody know how to get over this?",
    "Years of worsening chronic fatigue/fog continue to cripple my life Caffeine in any form doesnt help either. Ive seen 3 different psychologists, all of whom were baffled and said they did not know how to help me and have never heard of this before relative to mental health issues. I feel this intense dissociation feeling 247 that has gradually emergedworsened over the past couple of years. Like Im so tired, I dont even feel like Im in real life ever anymore. I feel drunkdrugged, especially as the day progresses. Come 8 PM, I feel so spaced out, the fatigue is unbearable. Sometimes, I feel so tired I feel physically ill. The gradual cognitive decline is shocking Concentration, alertness, memory, focus, processingrecallingstumbling over words and sentences, confusion, etc.. My motor skills have also declined badly as well. I bump into things, my reflexes are awful, I miss things when I try and grab them, etc. I feel dizzylightheaded when I stand up after sitting or laying down. I now have very low arousal. Its almost impossible to startle me. Its like my body doesnt even process loud noises or scare anymore. I feel anxiousstressedoverwhelmed more easily. Everything feels like a chore, like an ordeal I get to check off. Even if it is something extremely minor or something fun. Decision making is poor, even for relatively minor things. Hypersomnia Usually fall asleep very easily, rarely have insomnia. Vision has declined eye floaters, spots, light sensitivity. Eyes are drywatery off and on. Numbness all over body. Tough to explain, but extremitiesbody parts feel so utterly exhausted and numblike to the touch. Like I can feel my arm getting touched by my hand, but cant feel my hand touching my arm. Senses feel dulled Hearing, taste, smell, touch all feel weakened and suppressed, especially as the day goes on and I feel more tired. Sex drive is virtually nonexistent. Alcohol hits me much harder now. As a result, I feel intoxicated more easilyquickly.",

Ive studied tons of things, trying to find something that was for me, but I never got there, so I gave up. I still live at home. I want to try and lead a meaningful life, but I have no idea where to begin. It feels like theres too much to do, so I dont even start to try. Every day I am more filled with anxiety and dread and I feel like everything is too late. I know I need to do something, but I have no idea what. I crave love, but no one wants to date a loser, right? I cant see my therapist right now, because shes ill and Im just going crazy from the inside.

I know that Im not, but Im kinda starting to believe it. Some days, the most minor inconvenience can cause me to just give up completely and start crying. During these times, I just feel that life is pointless. It used to be not as bad, but now its escalating and I dont know if I can take it anymore. One of the worst parts about this, is that Ive started to shut out my friends and family. I feel really bad doing it, but I have do do it. One of my friends, who I thought I could tell about this, started to tell others and they made fun of me. I was traumatized. I dont want that to happen again. Please, help me with this.

    "At my wits end.... literally. I’ve lost all hope, I’m lost in my own head. So numb, tired, and ready to leave already. Its been roughly a year, I recently moved out of my parents house around this time last year. And its all gone to shit... I guess I rushed into adulthood faster then I should. Was promised a job from my mother in law. That only lasted 3 weeks. Ive been bouncing from warehouse to warehouse job for the last year. I feel disconnected from my own life. Worthless... like I dont belong. My relationship with my SO is rough. Theres days where its the ideal relationship, and days where I feel like Im the only one loving and actually trying. My relationship with my own family is little to none. I dont have the courage to say whats really going on. Idk I would rather people not care about me. Not worry or pressure me about whats going on. But Im at the end of my road and my last options are dark. I cant keep a job, cant keep a place, cant hold a conversation with family and friends. Im so numb and hollow. I cry randomly throughout the day, suicidal scenarios play out in my head all throughout the day. What if I wasnt around? People wouldnt have to worry. I wouldnt have to live a life I feel like I dont deserve. Ive contemplated actually doing it numerous times. Just cant choose on how and where as in stuck babysitting majority of the days. I feel like Im rambling all over the place but its how I am at this point. I have no structure in life. My schedule consists of doing everything for everyone else and then sleep. I feel useless and more importantly worthless.",
    "Feeling Lost I have Anxiety, PTSD, Bipolar Depression, Pulmonary Embolism, Obesity, and Mobility issues, and I am only 35Mliving in the Seattle Area. My selfconfidence and selfesteem have been depleted. I believe in God, I am Christan, but I dont have a home church because I dont have money for the buses. Its hard for me to go to medical appointments because I am just tired of the frequency, and if there is bad news, its only me and my shoulders. I dont have anyone to share the burden with. I have a giant hole inside of me, and I cant fix it. This past week or so, I have had this sense of feeling lost, and I have been sleeping almost all day and up most of the night. I am homeless, jobless, and I am also semidisabled. I use a fourwheel walker to help me get around long distances and a cane around the apartment. I have been staying with friends since I lost everything in a fire in February 2016. Because of my weight and health issues, homeless shelters wont take me because I am a highrisk liability. I sleep on the living room floor at my friends apartment, and their adult boys love to be up all night and play video games, so I dont get the best sleep. Eye masks and earplugs dont help me. I cant sleep in a chair that I have because I toss and turn. They dont give me the respect that I need so I can sleep and do stuff like hold down a job. I have lost several jobs because of my unstable living situation. I have no savings, no family to ask for help or stay with. One good thing that is going good for the most part is I am going to college online for a Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity and Networking, and I have one year left of schooling for the degree. Sorry for the long post. I just needed to vent and talk to someone even if its to a computer",

I could lose my job tomorrow and no matter the consequences I wont care what happens. I could lose all my friends and my mindset will still just be oh well shit happens. Does anyone else get this? I feel I go through the day not bothering or caring about anything at all. Even at my job everyone there knows I just couldnt care less about what happens but I get my job done so people dont seem to bother me about my attitude. Im on antidepressants which could be causing it but when Im off them Im in a constant state of existential dread. I think it might just be a realisation that nothing I do actually matters in the long run since I am eventually going to die and nothing will matter from then on. Does anyone else get like this?",

At this point I dont know what Im talking about but I just dont want to keep feeling like this.

I feel so ashamed and embarrassed, not of my actions as much as the fact that the whole word had to find out about it. I know youre thinking, this kid is in school, still a teenager and probably just overthinking it, but I literally cant go to the city center without fearing for my own life. I live in one of the biggest cities in the world, Ive lived here since forever and I know how big it is. I didnt think it would get this far, but it has. There is not one person I know that doesnt know about this. I cant have any friends here because everyone judges me and no one can ever see me for who I am, they even found ways to get to my friends abroad. I have nowhere to go, and no method of escaping the thoughts I get. I get mad at the world and I want to take revenge for all the people that hurt me but then I realize I could never possibly do that so then I feel powerless, just like how I felt all those other times when IT happened to me. So then I get mad at myself, and I make myself believe it was all my fault, and this leads to a cycle of self harm which very quickly develops into a fine line between life and death.

    "Struggling bad right now Ive 18m been struggling on and off with my depression for around 3 years now. I started smoking weed to deal with school and now college stress but that in itself has done more wrong than good as now im not only dependent but now I constantly have to lie to my mum about what Im doing which just makes me feel even more worthless and a failure of a son, not to mention the astronomical money I spend on drugs in general. I am failing college, my last chance to get a good education, meanwhile all my friends who have since moved across the country for Uni havent really kept in contact. The only people I see outside of work are the people who Im smoking weed with other than that I feel totally isolated. Every day I think of my death, how people would react and how Id do it. these thoughts went from being in the context of comfort while in a stressful situation to what feels like an inevitability  in other words I dont think like if I was to kill myself... instead I think When I kill myself.... on top of all this Im generally a clumsy person but also extremly self critical, whenever I make a dumb mistake it takes a toll on my mental state, every time I trip, stutter or whatever I feel totally worthless. I hate my music because it reminds me of hanging out with my friends who arent around anymore. There are more things but I dont want to ramble on. ampx200B No one knows this is how I truly feel, not even those closest to me. When I first started going through this I drunkenly told my friend a few tidbits but he didnt keep his word on not telling people so I decided to bottle everything up and pray that eventually my life would improve but since then its been a sharp decline. The reason Im writing this is because I feel someone needs to know even if its some guy 6500 miles away who knows nothing about me because I feel like if I told any of my friends it would change the way they see me plus I cant guarantee that whoever I told would keep it to themselves.",

She used to say something, only for dad to explode claiming he wants to talk politics and if we dont like it tough basically. He finally got the notion after 3 hours of being a douchebag to talk almost anything else with aunts husband. He does this because no one else wants to talk polotics or go off the handle about pretty technical mondane and boring javascript issues.

Hi guys Please can you try amp be as honest amp raw as possible, i really dont mind if comments are a bit brutal as feel like I need the truth telling!

My mum never showed me any direct love or any care just left to my own devices all my life leaving me to learn lifes hardest lessons on my own. Hoenstly a majority of life for me has been constant negative events, everything i love becomes everything i loosemy friendsfamilyjob self respect, esteem nothing ever goes right for me.

I dont know why this love had to come from a boy directly, but all my life Iv craved it, dream of it fantasized soo many things in my head just depserate to be loved. Im 22, never had a boyfriend, every single guy i go for has rejectived me because of how I look im not a size 8, but a size 22 instead and iv only ever known unrequited love.

My cousin who i am very close to, married the love of her life and they now have a boy, a girl. The perfect perfect family.

All feedback I get is, you were great, but we went with someone else or you lacked enthusiasm when I smiled and did my best to be interested during the entire interview. The gaming industry is very altrustic. Ive been stuck as a permatemp for a 1 year 7 months. I have a first degree and a lot of experience.

    "Depressed boyfriend left Last week my depressed boyfriend left me. Even at the end he was telling me how much he loved me.

I wouldve helped him in anyway possible and loved and supported him until the end of my days. Even if he couldnt give back to me. He said I made him feel safe and loved and happier than anyone else. How can I make sense of this? I ask that you help me understand the perspective of a depressed person on this. Its hard for me to understand why he would give up a source of comfort and love. I love him so much and hate to think of him alone and in misery. And then I start to hate myself because I wonder if I was a better girlfriend that I could have helped him and he would not leave me. The logical part of me says that I did everything I could but my heart doesnt feel that way. At the same time I loved him so much and he knew it. Any insight would be appreciated.",

    "Need help figuring out alternative reasons why I'm experiencing excessive sleep, extreme tiredness, low energy, no motivation but stable mood More recently  Started taking 50 mg Zoloft sertraline while weening off of Viibryd vilazodone in midApril. Have been taking lamictal lamotrigine almost as long as Ive taking medication for depression  Ive been wanting to get off of it for years but I either havent been consistently stable enough or it was not a good time due to school or work  finally started tapering off today To the point Throughout the past month, aforementioned symptoms have been worsening excessive sleep, extreme tiredness, low energy, no motivation. No matter the amount of sleep I get 4hrs, 6hrs, 8hrs, 10hrs, 20hrs I feel overwhelmingly exhausted when I wake up. Any energy or motivation I have seems erratic and is dwindling. Motivation is very upanddown but progressively more down. My depression has always been heavily tied to excessive sleep and lethargy. These symptoms are definitely nothing new to me, HOWEVER, its always been accompanied by very low moods. At this time my mood is decently stable and thats the baffling pay. I wouldnt say Im the happiest Ive ever been but Im stable. Instinctively I assumed it was a med problem since my symptoms are indicative but my Dr isnt entirely convinced thats the case since my mood is stable. She didnt up my Zoloft but we finally decided to taper off lamotrigine. She doesnt really know whats causing the excessive sleep and exhaustion. She mentioned that its possible the Vyvanse is negatively contributing even though its pretty much the only reason I can stay awake all day. She suggested there might be something else medically wrong. As luck would have it, I see my primary Dr tomorrow for my yearly exam so she told me to bring it up. Ive had my thyroid tested twice, the last time was a year ago and that checked out fine both times. I dont recall getting treated for anemia ever so maybe its that? Any other ideas? Id like to get a better idea before I go to the Dr.",
    "My mom is depressed and I don't know how to help her Hi everyone, this is my first time posting here so let me know if this this isnt the right place. ampx200B My 20F mom 58F has been depressed, to some degree, for as long as I can remember. Were a pretty sad family all together honestly, but thats all Ive known from them. ampx200B For some backstory My dad 61M fixed up my grandparents old house the one my mom grew up in over the course of a few years. The old house was falling apart, and my dad wanted a new place to renovate before he got too old to do so. My mom never wanted to move in, but reluctantly agreed once my dad pointed out the benefits. ampx200B So here we are, a year after we move in, after all the garage sales and selling the old house, getting rid of sentimental items we couldnt keep and all the junk we didnt want. And shes spiraling, guys. Ive always been her person to vent to, since Ive been alive. And every night she tells me just how tired she is, of everything. How she misses the old house that they spent over 30 years in, how she hates every tiny thing my dad does, just blaming him for everything. She cried into my arms tonight asking what she has to look forward to everyday, to just tell her something good in her life to look forward to. And no matter what I said she would just cry harder. ampx200B I dont know what to do to help her, if anything. I know my dad isnt going to help because they argue just about every day and havent got along in like.. 15 years. My mom doesnt have many friends either, just her sister and some people she cleans houses for. Is there anything I can do to help her on the bad days?",
    "I don't know what to do I dont even know why Im making this post. I think maybe writing about it helps, but honestly maybe Im just trying to reach out for help. Im not really sure about my feelings at this point.",
    "Every night just before drifting off to sleep, I'm overwhelmed with feelings of self hate and guilt. Im a seasoned pro in dealing with depression but this is getting out of hand. It used to happen every once in a while, but now its consistent every night. As I lay here with my eyes closed and I begin to dream, suddenly I realize Im a horrible employee and Im on the verge of losing my job. Or Im a horrible father and my son deserves better. Or Im a horrible husband who should have let someone better marry my wife and make her happy. Or I suddenly realize my finances are messed up for someone my age. Or I feel like Im the worst kind of friend. The tremendous feeling of guilt is absolutely overwhelming and I wake up and have to often times sit up, my heart pounding like crazy. The house is a mess, Ive been working on the same task too long at work and theyre going to find out Im a fraud, I have a ton of yard work I need to do and the neighbors think Im a total slob, my son doesnt feel loved and needs better things in life. The list expands exponentially if I let it, even as I type it out its flowing in like a river of crippling worry, my face is completely bloodshot like Im embarrassed, and I cant catch my breath. All I want to do is go on facebook and tell everyone how sorry I am for being so embarrassing. Or go sit at my desk and work more so I have more to report on in the standup. Or go lay with my 4 year old son and tell him how proud of him I am and how great his Lego creation tonight was. Or clean and organize the whole house so my wife wakes up and feels good about being married to me. I get this frantic feeling like it all needs to happen, but its too late, the day is over, and I messed up again. I did not feel this way an hour ago when I laid down in my bed. It spikes in me just before drifting off to sleep, like I was watching my life in a movie but then I suddenly realize its real and I am overcome with fear, dread, embarrassment, and guilt, like Im driving a train off a bridge or something.",
    "Need advice o how to help my SO who is suffering with depression. Sorry if it's not the right place to put this. My SO is suffering with depression and anxiety and is refusing to get help. Its almost like he just doesnt want to. In fact he has said on multiple occasions that he doesnt want to get better. It all started when we had a termination for many different health reasons on my part. That was a good 6 months ago now. I went straight back to work afterward and he just didnt. All he is doing is burying his head in video games, he doesnt leave the house, doesnt help around the house or anything. We have been trying to get him to see someone and he just flat out refuses. He self medicates as well and I dont think that is helping at all, in fact I think it maybe contributing to the problem. But anytime anyone brings it up he just says that it isnt a problem. He did start to take some antidepressants but has decided that he isnt going to take them anymore. I know we cant force him to get help but he needs to do something. I have been trying to support him by giving him space and letting him do his own thing, but that just doesnt seem to be working. I just dont know what to do anymore. I am scared to bring any of this up to him as he just gets very defensive and nasty towards me just to clarify its not physical its just hurtful. Need some advice on what I can do to help.",
    "online friend is seriously considering suicide, and I don't know how to help theres this girl who I met through a discord server that has been dealing with depression for a while shes currently on antidepressants, but she doesnt feel that theyre working for her and when she brought it up to her parents, they just said theyre not working bc she isnt trying hard enough or something, and shes recently been talking a lot about committing suicide. shes mainly been saying that its because shell never be happy and shes just a burden on everyone.

    "I don’t know what to do I 19 have been severely depressed for about 6 years undiagnosed. At around the same time my depression started, I was pulled out of public school by my mom so she could homeschool me. Her idea of homeschooling is to not teach me and instead expects me to be motivated enough to work completely on my own with no deadlines. I dont have any motivation to live, let alone finish my schooling. I am almost 20 and have not graduated high school. I only need to CLEP out of three more classes to graduate but the task feels so overwhelmingly impossible and I know Im running out of time. I feel like I have already ruined my life so why finish? Depression has fucked up my brain so bad I fear it is damaged beyond repair. Im not living anymore. The only thing I do now is scroll through social media all day and think about possibly doing my schoolwork. And to think I was once the smart kid. The one advantage I have is that I started taking college classes when I was 14 and have nearly enough credits for an associates degree. I might be able to transfer to a 4year school but I dont know who will be willing to accept me since i never took the ACT or SAT. Even if I did get in to a good university, what the hell would I major in? I had a few interests in mind but depression has taken them away and subjects that I once found intriguing no longer bring me joy. I have no idea where to start. I just really, really need advice and a reason to keep going. Thanks for listening.",
    "Girlfriend self harmed HELP!! Me and my girlfriend before we started dating, talked for a little over a month. After that period I went MIA because I wasnt in the best mental state to be talking to people and didnt want to hurt us. I was MIA for a month and I returned and I apologized for not taking for so long and it ending making things worse. That night my girlfriend and I started a FaceTime. And she was in a bathroom. She said chase look  very gleeful and had blood coming down her wrist. I was in shock. I talked about later with her and she said she did self harming because I was gone for so long that when she saw me she had the urge to cut herself. Her cutting herself has been a thing for a little bit now but Ive been recently depressed because I made her do that. I just want to puke thinking of what me being gone did to her. I worry that if I ever left, shed cut and maybe kill herself. I worry that I might need to take a week break from reality And Im stressing about it somewhat becoming into a depressed state 247. What do I even do?",

My new character starts tomorrow and itll almost definitely make DnD as bad as school is, but I keep telling myself I deserve the pain Im going to feel and I really hope the pain I cause myself will push me to suicide real suicide not just chickening out at the last minute.

Mornings are terrible. I have no hope that I can continue on a normal career path. I feel as though I am less than 1 of the person I can be. Ive always struggled with social interaction. Every interaction gives me anxiety. The panic that I often feel during interactions is similar to wave a adrenaline you get from a roller coaster. The panic doesnt allow me to gather any thoughts and remain present in the conversation. My mind just thinks get out at all times. I spend my days and nights alone unless I have to interact with someone at work. I absolutely hate living like this. This is not how an adult should be behaving.

I am very fortunate in this sense. However, I am worried about the effects of things like social distancing and isolation on mental health. That is not to say that I disagree with these measures whatsoever, but like so many other people, being isolated is damaging to my wellbeing. My question is as a college student living in a dorm without a roommate, how can I cope and what are some things I can do in my newfound time from my room? Note I have 3 weeks of remote classes after break. I could stay home longer but I feel that would be even more damaging to my psyche.",

How could I do that with him, when he probably didnt know what he would do with the rest of my life. ampx200B I just cant love him. I hate him. Sometimes I wish he was dead. Then I blame myself because I know that if he dies Im going to feel very guilty. ampx200B But I dont know. I dont know if Im gay, straight, bisexual.

Now that Im a certain age, im expected to function normally but somehow I cant find anything to motivate me. I cant find anything that interests me and drives me to do better. The feeling sucks.

    "No appetite, suggestions? Hiii and thanks in advance for any advice here. I struggle even wanting to talk about it because my family members are all I have, and they all 3 have binge eating habits. I feel guilty about it so please be gentle with me. About 4 or 5 years ago when my mental health started taking a nose dive I noticed I started losing my appetite. I started to fluctuate around 2030 lbs throughout these years. I have no trouble continuing to drink. Ive mentioned it to my doctors but they have never elaborated on it with me, and I have had blood drawn a few times, making it seem like its not as much of a problem. But its getting worse, no matter what food I prepare or go pick up I can only eat a few bites before I cant even chew it anymore and have to put it away. And I only do that 12 times a day. Its really starting to get to me. Does anyone here also go through this? Ive thought about some kind of protein drink for when Im on the brink of passing out.

I forgot how dark my notes were. It was honestly very eye opening but I think reading about my suicidal thoughts, in the current situation concerned her a lot. This morning, she handed me the letter, saying Id have to read it when Im feeling down. She wrote about our friendship, how we give each other the courage to be ourselves, how much Ive helped her, how much she wants to be there for me. I read the letter twice, I cried both times. Now I feel guilty for worrying her. How do I respond?",
    "I'm not sure how to tell my mother I'm depressed Trigger warning NSFW  there will be mentions of self harm Before anyone jumps to any conclusions please know I love my mother. Shes has an interesting way of handling situations. She just wants best for me and everyone and doesnt know how to handle certain situations. I think the beginning was 7th grade. Its the age when Im told kids around my age go through their adolescent stage. They become defiant of their parents and so forth. Im not sure if this is applicable for everyone but I was one of the kids who defied their parents and acted like a brat. Im certain from grade 7 it was just my teenage phase but now Im not sure because at grade 8 and 9 these mood swings got progressively worse and I began to act more sad than just moody. In grade 9 I ended up going to the office to have a talk with the counselor. Dont shame me for this but I had just began to use social media and my account was small so only my friends knew my account. Maybe it was for the better but I had posted on my story that I was going to ct myself for everyone friend of mine. During this time my family was in the rough. My parents were talking about divorce because they were living apart for too long and their gears just didnt click well together after being apart for too long and just recently getting to live with each other. I dont know what had gotten to me because I probably shouldnt have posted such a sensitive topic but I posted it but didnt completely follow through with it. I did very minor scratches. Maybe I was seeking comfort and attention. Anyways, I had posted it, this concerned my friends and it went all the way to the schools counselor and I ended up having a talk. I just bawled during the counsel meeting and asked if this would get to my parents and the counselor said yes. I didnt want to let my parents know because it would simply add fuel into the fire with my parents constantly talking about divorce. Anyways long story short this got to my parents and things got just a bit messier. My parents fought and mentioned my problems and blamed one another and it was difficult.",

Maybe these things would work if I tried them again even if they havent in the past, but for two reasons I haventbesides cost. First I dont think theyd work or the side effects to meds wouldnt be worth it. But second and perhaps more important idk that I want to get better, I feel like I should live with all the shitty feelings and guilt, like I have to or deserve to. I dont do it for attention, maybe once in my life when I was much more lost, when all this depression started to get bad, but not anymore, I barely even talk about my depression to anyone anymore.

    "Awful nightmares and bad sleep So Ive 23f been diagnosed with depression since 18. Meds only semi work and i have a few people i know i can count on as support but over the last couple months Ive been experiencing extreme night terrors. What makes them worse is how realistic they feel, as Im sort of semi conscious when they happen. It makes it harder for me to distinguish whats real and what isnt. Someone im incredibly close to saw me have one, apparently i was crying and thrashing like crazy and when i finally snapped out of it i was a mess for ages even as they held me and tried to bring me back from the horrible head space i was in. Its made me reluctant to sleep as I live at home with parents and sleep alone and when it happens i end up getting no sleep as Im terrified of it happening again so wont try to go back to sleep. Ive tried adapting the mentality of suck it up and forcing myself back to bed after it happens when Im on my own but I struggle to get out of that head space and still lose a good hour or so of sleep before i finally feel comfortable enough to sleep. I was wondering if theres anything i can do when im on my own to calm and ground myself quicker after it happens?",

Ive never done much on those days other than lie around, or maybe play some video games if I felt like it. These were the worst days for me, constant suicidal thoughts since my parents and brotherssister wouldnt be home, either at school or work. These are the days that I kept toying with the idea, feeling safe in a weird way, I know that I could kill myself if I needed to. I havent skipped for about a month or so, but all throughout yesterday I was thinking as I get closer and closer to graduation, theres a time limit of sorts on when Im actually going to go through with it, as it gets closer and closer I feel more pressure that I have to do it, because I feel like I need to kill myself before I graduate high school, Im not sure why. Today I woke up at 630, and as soon as I got up I was already battling with the idea of whether or not to go to school, and this thought stayed with me throughout breakfast, throughout my shower. I told my brother, who I normally walk to school with, that my alarm woke me up late and that hed better walk to school ahead of me if he didnt want to be late, so he left. I literally did nothing for the next 30 minutes to an hour, literally felt nothing, just thinking about what I was going to do.",
    "I'm so tired I remember the next day where during all of class I lied in bed, not saying a word to the friends I usually talk to all day, it just all felt so hopeless. That night I remember asking my mom to look into therapy again then went upstairs and lied on the floor of my room for a half hour crying and trying to vent out what I was feeling, but everytime I talked about it I was too scared to fully explain to my friends, leaving it coming off as a student wanting to be lazy rather than sheer hopelessness and a severe lack of any will to keep living they it really was. I took the AP exam yesterday on my birthday, it was fine enough but left me wondering why I even did that, why did I go through all that stress and mental fatigue to look kind of good for colleges?

    "My teen brother depressed during quarantine Hi all, This is my first time posting so I apologize if I miss a flair or something. First of all, Im a grad student living at home with family. I have a 16 year old brother that I live with, with my mom and other sibling father comes by often to visit. My bro has always been the type of teen to spend hours alone in his room, usually in bed, in the dark lights almost always off. He is usually on his phone and listening to music. Pretty typical teen stuff though the fact he sometimes spends hours in his room in the dark, not particularly doing anything, has always worried me. Since quarantining, so for about a month, he has become increasingly lethargic and unmotivated. He doesnt want to go outside for walks or drives. He is doing some of his school work, but missing meetings and other assignments. His sleep schedule is all over the place, I honestly dont know how much he sleeps and how much he just spends laying in bed. My parents are not the best at handling the situation. It usually results in yelling, sometimes violence, and my brother usually reverts more into his seclusion and silence. Im basically just looking for any advice. How can I help him? Thanks in advance.",
    "Did I destroy my brain and chances to be happy? I was on strong antidepressants since I was 15. I often abused drugs and alcohol. Back then I remember reading about how dangerous the combination of seratonin boosting stuff like ecstasy and antidepressants can be, but didnt care. I continued this risky game for about 3 years, when I was 18 and decided on my own I wouldnt need antidepressants anymore and immediately stopped taking them. I had horrible withdrawal symptoms  irregular heartbeat, almost passing out several times a day, cold sweat, dizziness, I felt like dying... so after a few days I took my meds again because I couldnt take it anymore... I lowered my dose each day until I felt like I could take the withdrawal symptoms. Now the thing is I am 21, have a girlfriend, have a fulltime job, but absolutely no joy in life whatsoever. I do absolutely nothing. I cant even bring myself to do the bare minimum. All I end up doing is swiping through social media and thats it. Every day off. My girlfriend likes to go out for dinner, the cinema, shopping, or even just go for a walk and so on. Shes basically dragging me along, I experience no happiness or joy, no matter what she suggests or what we end up doing. Theres just... nothing. Weve been together for 1½ years and I can tell shes getting exhausted. I am so sorry for her. Shes a wonderful person, I really love her, but she was so unlucky to fall in love with a person whos basically a wall.... Is there any chance I can fix what I fucked up in my youth?",

    "Is it all even worth it? Just to start it off, I DO NOT WANT TO KILL MYSELF. But recently Ive just been overwhelmed and I dont have anyone with whom I could share this. So basically before the winter breakweek ago everything was going great. I went on a friendly date with my crush that went well, my engineering contest was going great my biggest dream is to get into MIT and I am capable and school was fine. Fast forward to a few days ago when it all started going to shit. My crush left for a ski trip and gone cold, dont know if I did something wrong I have Aspergers and Im a typical stereotypical nerd, aka no dating skills, basically I dont pick up on the subtle hints at all or is it just the trip, I cant stop thinking about it and her, its very hard for me to find girls that I would call compatible, basically someone with a deep passion for something that basically defines them. That makes me distracted from my work which stresses me out even more. The contest Im taking part in is also kinda collapsing and Im very worried that Ill loose thousands of hours of CAD work and 500 in my currency 1500 that I invested into the project that I was promised back. Another team posted pictures that made me really anxious because of their complexity compared to the other teams and given their perfect score they might win. And the school part, my homeroom teacher that basically told me that he doesnt give a shit about me or my goals and that my reasons for joining this contest are wrong and that its all my fault that its gone to shit and that Im a tyrant who takes away all the work from my teammates which is totally false because they havent done a thing and basically dont care, anything I proposed I was told to do myself and most of the tasks of the other teammates also partially fell on me, like Hey can you help him with that? It got so bad that I had to get outside help which made my teacher even more mad so he started insulting me straight to my face, as well as behind my back, saying he doesnt want anything to do with me and basically disrespect my entire work and from my schoolmates tell me he is quite proud of it, it got to the point where my parent had to go and talk with the school.",
    "I'm not feeling too well right now.... I feel like im in a big depression since im 10 years old im 25. The only thing that helped me  a lot was beeing with my ex, who was my first gf and the only person who showed me love. Now that she dumped me for the guy she cheated me with..im..im not feeling very well. IM thinking about trying to kill myself again everyday. Its been two month since shes out of my life. I cant seem to be able to get over it. I tried a lot of thing, Beeing active, new activities, talk to friends, eat well, taking medication, talk to a psy, etc. Nothing work.

    "I feel like my mental health is deteriorating constantly being someone’s emotional support, I don’t know what to do. I have a friend who regularly comes to me for emotional support. Shes my friend, so of course I do my best to be there for her and listen to her problems but at the same time, its becoming a toxic situation because Ive been feeling pretty down myself, and its been taking a toll on my emotion wellbeing. I honestly dont mean to sound selfish at all, I really want to help her but I feel like its too much for me to handle. Its a tough situation because I feel like Im not fit to be her emotional support as Im going through things myself and I havent been feeling great for a while but I dont think I can tell her that, I know shes going through a lot. Sometimes I have a meltdown because I feel so much pressure and stress, i dont know how to reply to her, I dont know how to handle it. Feels like we dont talk about anything else other than her problems, and I really want to help but its so hard. I know she relies on me for support a lot. Its been a few years since this has been happening. Shes always coming to me, and Im pretty sure only me and I feel like a sponge just absorbing all her sadness. I dont want her to feel like shes a burden to me, though I cant help feeling this way. Has anyone been in this sort of situation ? What can I do? Thanks for reading.",
    "I feel like I can’t talk to anyone Recently my boyfriend the only person Ive talked to about my seasonal depression told me that he thinks Im too emotionally dependent on him. I understand why he says that as previously stated hes the only person Ill talk to and I understand that he said it because hes worried. But it makes me feel like I cant talk to him either anymore. I dont know what to do, I dont want to be emotionally dependent on someone but I cant do this alone either. Ive cried myself to sleep so many times since he told me, Ive wanted to self harm again so badly, and I cant talk about it to anyone. I tried telling him that I just feel worse and all he said was I dont know what to say. I guess my reaction to what he said just proves that I am emotionally dependent on him but I just need someone I trust to talk to, but recently my best friend has become someone I barely recognize. I dont have anyone else to talk to, now I dont have anyone. I recently made an appointment to go see one of my colleges guidance councillors, but I havent had my appointment yet. I guess Ill see what comes of that...",
    "Complete recovery after depression is a realistic expectation? Hey, before depression took over my life I23F used to be such a happy person  joyful, positive, hyped about all kinds of activities, passionate about life. Before finishing college I used to think that lack of time is my only problem, I had so many plans and wishes and I used to think that depression isnt a real thing, that some people just choose to be unhappy. And then it hit me  repressed childhood trauma, unhealthy relationships with my family members and too many disappointments in my love life gave me depression. At first I thought its only a bad phase and I was expecting it to end soon since I was about to start my summer vacations. I had planned a 2 weeks trip to Scotland and I was really hyped about it for like 6 months before leaving, but somehow I couldnt enjoy it, I only wanted to sleep and be alone and I was struggling to get through each day without being rude or visibly irritated by everything was going on around me. Thats when I realized that bad phase was a special one, but I only decided to get specialized help when I was already 4 months deep into it. At that point I was a mess, crying several times every day, spending all my free time sleeping, being terrified of my own thoughts, started thinking about suicide, pursuing a toxic online relationship, being unable to watch movies or reading books due to losing my ability to concentrate. At that moment, one of my best friends told me I was only a shadow of the person I used to be. The best feeling I was able to get about anything was this is almost acceptable. After my first visit to the psychiatrist I was put on medication and after only one month things became a little bit brighter for me  Christmas was coming and I started WANTING TO DO STUFF AWAKE!! I started watching netflix again, playing video games, hanging out with friends. I was still sad mostly, but I was able to enjoy these things from time to time which was nice. I also got fired right before Christmas for sleeping too much at work and doing almost nothing because of my depression, but I wasnt even mad about it.",
    "Group Session I dont like to talk about myself or my feelings cause I couldnt show my feelings in front of my mom or else I would get scolded or slapped or some shit so I enrolled for group session about positive thinking and shit but I dont think its gonna ever help me because I cant speak up about what I am feeling. I mean I can type it here because I feel like you guys dont feel obligated to read this and you just do it because u have time. I feel like she has to listen to me no matter what and I feel even more uncomfortable around older women and especially talking about my feelings around people I cant do that. I feel selfish and guilty for showing feelings. What should I even do? I dont know what to do anymore. I cant sleep, or eat unless I am good enough because I am not good enough if I dont study enough and score good marks and guess who almost failed maths? I did  . I just think I should die at this point, because Ill never be enough. Like never.",

    "Depression, procrastination and graduation Hello, thats my first post ever on reddit. I am in huge trouble and I put myself there now I need to face this but I dont know what to do. I always had panic attacks and alot of stress since I was just a child. but when I started university it doubled and I came to the point last year where I couldnt get out of bed, let alone study. I closed myself off and didnt get out of my room for a month, That had consequences on my grades and that made me hate myself even more. I used to be very disciplined, a grade A student so that felt like a punch to the guts. Anyway, this year I have a graduation project I need to work on. I thought I learned from that past experience but I really didnt. I was procrastinating out of fear for 5 months now. whenever I start I just start trembling and cant concentrate on anything Im reading. that led me to withdraw from poeple, my teacher my friends because Im too ashamed of my behaviour and I cant face them. Im in deep shit I want to get out of this but I dont know how. This is not how I thought my life and my view towards myself turn out . PS I was taking medications for anxiety and for depression but I stopped them now .",
    "I’m sick of everything, my life is just meant to be miserable. I was never liked at school. I felt like outsider wherever I went. Nobody was ever in love with me. I never had a friend, first people that I started to hangout with I met a year ago. For majority of my life I was overweight, at some point I was even obese. I lost over 50lbs 23kg a year ago and I do everything to maintain my weight on a healthy level. I have to be focused on what I eat, I gain weight in the matter of days. Every cheat day feels like one step closer to my past self. My relationship with food is extremely bad and I dont know how to change it. I dont fit anywhere. I dont feel good in any place, I shout my mouth around people for them not to be forced to hear about my problems that sometimes spill out through my mouth unintentionally. Who would want to be around with such a loser for longer anyway? I met a boy online, after a couple of months we became really good friends. We always have something to talk about, we share so many experiences and he respects me and wants only good for me. I had a hard time with men because of my father, I never believed they would value me or they would use me quickly after getting along. But this guy showed me that there are good men out there, with a softer side and responsible mind. After talking and calling each other for a longer time I realized how safer and calmer I feel now that hes in my life. Even unconsciously I feel his gentle presence. Now I think that I realized what does love mean and that I have feelings for him. Hes from a different country though. I was saving up for plane tickets and the trip there, I started planning everything in March and look, its July and nothing happened. Even though I was researching all the legal information, translating documents, buying necessary things, keeping myself updated on flights, Im still here. And I have no idea if I will ever get there. There are too many obstacles.",

I am broke and cannot afford a lot of furniture so I hear EVERYTHING. They always slam shit so hard it shakes my floors and triggers my ptsd very badly, I think the person is getting abused downstairs so I had enough and finally called the police on them to file a domestic abuses complaint. I packed up my ps4 and let the cops in as I made my way out. Ive resorted to going to my parents on the weekends to avoid their slamming and fighting. Im so sick of living in a shithole and being forced to stay away from home every fucking weekend. I miss my poor cat who is my lifeline, I dont like having to leave her alone. But if I stay it triggers my manic depressive BPD and Ill just lay in silence fixating on the thumping and arguing while I contemplate suicide bc I hate my fucking situation.

Im scared of going back to my apartment tomorrow because even though the cops came, nothing will change. I still live in a shithole and a never ending nightmare of being woke up to slamming. Im tired of careless people. A couple weeks ago they triggered a BPD episode to the point where I punched a hole in the wall. They love to blast music and movies with their big ass bass that shakes my floors. I wrote a letter to them begging them to stop. Nothing changed. The rental company will do nothing as always. Or theyll kick them out so crackheads will move in. No where feels safe anymore. I miss my poor baby cat who is alone at home now. Im scared to go back to my apartment tomorrow because theyll probably just keep slamming shit. I CSNT afford to move to a new place. I cant find a job.

Still I felt I had to write her a message telling  this means I wont come for christmas, but thanks again, Because I feared she would be upset. Afterwards she textes me like... 4 times.. Messages likeHey, Im so worried, can you please answer me? EVEN thoug I told her that this selfisolation meant that I wouldnt have contact with people around me! Because that pushes me back.

I explained my thoughts on this matter to him and he told me that he didnt think it through and maybe was overhasty to break up and admitted his actual reason for breaking up were his thoughts going in circles, so he just ended things to stop this  although it seems that this didnt improve anything for him. He said he doesnt know what his feelings for me are but he doesnt want to lose me and a lot of other things none of which sounded like things you tell a friend. I dont know what to do. I want to give him time but as far as I know, hes doing nothing to improve his situation and I cant take this much longer.

I am sure I am about to name off items that people deal with daily or have gone through so please forgive me for redundancy. We have a 3 year old daughter and weve been together for 7 to 8 years 9 married 5 years. Ive never in my life felt anything as soul crushing as this. I cant sleep and even if I do I cant escape through my dreams because its all I dream about. Im 35 years old and I have gone through heartbreaks throughout my years but nothing like this. I dont know what to do... I dont want to hit the bottles cause I know that isnt healthy. The thought of even dating down the road when im ready makes me sick. I honestly want to die but dont have the balls to off myself. Work is a struggle, eating is a struggle, working out is a struggle...this might sound odd but right now I would love to trade places with a tree or just an object that has no feelings.... I dont really have friends, me and family dont communicate, I dont really have anyone thus why I am on here making a post. I though I knew pain but I didnt. Im really struggling, this is the hardest thing in my life at the moment and i feel like my world has come crashing down. Hell I probably cry 36 times a day, short spurts to long cries. I feel really down in the dumps and I just dont know how I am going to prevail. Thank you everyone who reads this and providing input, and thank you to whoever reads this just to read it. I feel like im in a nightmare,",
    "Does anyone else totally disassociate when they're drunk? Okay, so I know that alcohol is a depressant and that it usually doesnt mix well when youre already depressed, but I wouldnt think a response to it would ever be consistently this bad. Long story short, went out for a few drinks with some work friends to celebrate my last day and the new job that I got. It was fun, these are people I like, and things were starting to get a bit better for me. Took 173 applications but I finally got a salaried gig, finally established a group of friends for myself after moving to a new city in a pandemic, found an advisor for my masters thesis. But at a certain point, maybe one or two beers past where I should have stopped, I just wasnt there. I left, didnt say goodbye to anyone, attempted to bike home, and cried on the side of the road after falling off my bike. Im usually a little bit of an emotional drunk, but I mostly just get affectionate and want to make sure my friends know that I love them. Its never been this, Ive never felt this outside of my own experience. Thoughts?",
    "Girlfriend is bullied by her parents and forced to give up on her dreams. My girlfriend wanted to study gastronomy but her parents made comments like Youll smell like onions, no one will look at you. Have fun working at BK. etc. and she just gave up on everything. I tell her all kinds of positive things and how she can still chase her goals. I keep telling her that its her life and it shouldnt matter what they say but she totally convinced herself that she is good for nothing. She is always bullied by her parents like this. Yes we are still young and yes the relationship wont last forever but I dont care, I just want her to be happy in the future. Please help me with advices.",

    "Years of worsening chronic fatigue/fog continue to cripple my life Hey everybody, My life itself has always been pretty good, but my quality of life has been awful for the last 8ish years. I am currently 23, and this is a quick timeline of whats been going on  Age 1314, started experiencing general anxiety for no apparent reason. Also, felt stressed a lot for no real reason either. Doctor thought it might be anxietydepression so suggested I see a therapist and try some antidepressants. I tried a couple antidepressants and saw a therapist with no success. Antidepressants did absolutely nothing, and therapist was at a loss as to how to help. This generalized anxietyworrystress feeling continued. Age 16, while still dealing with the above, I woke up one day after a good nights sleep and felt a little tired. I attributed it to anxiety or stress from school, but it NEVER went away. But it was very mild, so I just let it go and tried making lifestyle changes with no success. Over the months and years, it has very gradually worsened to the point where Im at now where I can hardly function due to the overwhelming fatiguebrain fog. It is 247. Not even a second of feeling better. Age 17present Have had nearly every sort of medical testing one can have done, many of them multiple times. Food allergy, vitaminmineral deficiencies, thyroid, cortisol, testosterone, heavy metals, MRI, EEG, EKG, Lyme disease, Epstein Barr, h pylori, sleep apnea, dietary changes, sleep schedule changes, increase exercise, etc. Have tried a total of 7 different antidepressantsanxieties from different drug classes to see if maybe depression was the culprit. All either did nothing or made me more tiredfoggy. Ive tried Vyvanse, Adderall, Ritalin, kratom, CBD, kava, and countless other supplements. The stimulants all either helped very slightly, but felt very artificial and made my body more anxious but didnt help my mind, or didnt do anything. Caffeine in any form doesnt help either.",
    "Just found out the girl I’ve speaking to the last 7 years is talking to someone else. Need some advice please. Hi, Throw away account just cause I dont feel real comfortable posting this on my main account. Also excuse the formatting If its not correct, and the length. Im a 26 year old male whos had a thing for their best friend I know right for the last 7 years known her for 14 years and I only just found out tonight that the reason shes been ignoring me for the last week is because shes speaking to another male. Shes known Ive had the feelings for her for the last 7 years and she always tells me she doesnt feel the same way. Weve had so many arguments over some real stupid shit like her blocking me on social media when she goes out so I dont see any photos of her with guys because she knows I get real upset about it. Every time we have the conversation of my feelings I always ask her to be honest with me and tell me if shes talking to someone, because itll hurt me less coming from her rather than me finding out the hard way, and she always tells me no. The last time we had this conversation was 2 weeks ago. Fast forward to tonight, I had a mutual friend come over who I havent seen in around 2 years who asked me if I still have feelings for her. Me not wanting to show my emotions said I dont, so she then followed by saying oh my god can you believe shes talking to name. I was like wtf are you talking about? She then began to tell me how she has been talking to our mutual friends friend for the last 23 months. She then began to show me all these photos and messages that the mutual has shown her, so I got to see everything with my own eyes. I always had a feeling she was hiding something from me but I always got the answer no from her so I always ignored. Shes my best friend, shes literally the reason Im still alive. Ive been through hell and back with her, and I value her friendship so much that I can get through all the suffering and pain I have when shes around just so I can spend some time with her, but all she does when she comes over is sit on her phone for hours and just smiles at it.",
    "Meds helped for a short period of time, but now I have no energy again, and can't do things. Any advice? Long story short I was diagnosed a few months ago, but was in denial because I wasnt actually sad about life, suicidal, etc. I started taking SSRIs LexaproEscitalopram and got a taste of what things could be like. For once, I had all the energy I needed. I didnt spend forever in bed or on the couch deliberating when I wanted to do something, took five minutes to just pull myself up. I no longer felt like I was fighting the weight of my entire body to do simple tasks. After 2 weeks I decided to drink, and thats when it went downhill. For 9 days, I was without energy, spent hours on the couch watching TV each day, not getting up to do much besides work. I doubled my dose, then for a few days it got better. Energy was back, I was doing things, etc. But then it went back to normal. To be clear, Im still not depressed in the classical sense of having negativity about life. I have hope for the future, overall Im pretty happy with where I am. However, I miss having the energy I had. I miss being able to actually work towards my goals and not feel exhausted by basic chores. My mind would go on autopilot, and I didnt have to constantly make decisions to preserve energy. Any suggestions on what I should do next? Ive been on Lexapro for 4 weeks, with a small gap last week where I didnt take it for 2 days straight. Im not sure whether I should seek other meds, keep on my current ones, or even look for other factors when it comes to regaining my energy. Im goign to book a doctors appointment and discuss options, but I wanted to know if anyone else had similar issues, and what theyve done.",
    "I feel like I can't anymore. When I was 15 I thought of killing myself almost daily for 5 months straight, I broke when my mother saw me have a panic attack and called me dramatic, I told her I wanted to kill myself, she told to do it. She has always been abusive, verbally and emotionally and I have been trying to get better on my own because going to therapy is so expensive and I am 18 and not allowed to get a job. My father died almost 2 months ago, he was the one who loved me, he was the one who heard me but now I have my mom that sometimes is nice and sometimes is the worst and a brother that when he gets mad threatens to punch me or slap me. I feel like life is just over, I haven been hours staring at my ceiling thinking how the world would be a better place without me, that I am worthless and I feel like I cant take this anymore. My country, Ecuador, doesnt have suicide lines and I feel so alone, this is my only way to reach help, please, please, help me, even if its a little.",

This is the first milestone I suppose. My counsellor says I need to try to find my new normal. This is my new normal and I dont like it. I wish he was here, I miss him so much and Ive no one to tell. Dont get me wrong  Im back at work, Im trying to plan a new future. Its just, sometimes, it smashes me in the face and the only thing I can do is crumple up into a ball and try to breathe. How am I supposed to carry on with life without the only person who advised me? I have literally no one to talk to about life stuff, help me make grown up decisions, tell me Im being unreasonable? I suppose we are all children until we dont have a parental figure, then we have to become the grown up. Im 44.",
    "r/Suicidewatch didn't really give me what I needed, so I'm sharing my feelings on this subreddit Personally, Id prefer if someone could add some advice or comment as opposed to that, since it felt unhelpful. Whenever my dad yells at me, I feel like if I were gone then he would be happier. My dad yells at me for a lot of things, and it just makes me hate myself for being so inferior, and not being good enough for him. If I was gone, his life would be better, and my friends wouldnt care since they barely talk to me when Im alive. rsuicidewatch people dont even look through new posts, and the one comment I got from posting my feelings there was to come here lmao, and thats probably because there is more engagement on here. Ive lost hope, and the desire to move on. Im sorry for even being on this subreddit. I feel like such a burden to everyone, and I feel like a mistake.",
    "Skipped school to kill myself, didn't go through with it, what now? Please help me, anyone. I literally did nothing for the next 30 minutes to an hour, literally felt nothing, just thinking about what I was going to do. Then after that I just went to my bed, and started researching for maybe 34 hours, methods, what to expect, etc. etc., all these things that I had been too scared to look up before. Found out the way I wanted to go, was literally about to go find the things I needed, but was so scared that I wanted to delay it somehow, even though I was still determined to go through with it. I told myself that I would set a timer for 30 minutes to sleep, and after that if I still wanted to kill myself, Id do it after that. Well when I woke up, I felt a little different, a little more hopeful, Im honestly not sure why, just hopeful enough to not kill myself today at least. Now I have to figure out what to do next. I had a math test today, an ap macro final, a small spanish presentation, and an anatomy quiz. It just seems so so so overwhelming, like I cant deal with it and I dont even know where to start, or what to say to the teachers, or if I can still take them, or what I tell my dad when the school calls today to tell him I wasnt there, or what to do about trying to manage this so I dont end up going through with my plan tomorrow, or the day after that, or next week. I really, really, appreciate any help at all. Feeling really lost right now. Sorry for the long post. Thanks for reading if you managed to get this far.",

    "I dont know what to do anymore Hey, Im feeling really bad for a pretty long time, I think it all started about 2 and 12 years ago. Back then it wasnt as dramatic as now, I think of suicide for half a year straight. I dont go to a therapist because I gotta take my parents with me and theyre a big part of my situation. I just feel so worthless and that no one likes me. Most of my classmates have lost their virginity or at least kissed a girl and im almost 16 and never had anything like this. I have basically no friends and the person I always talke with is annoyed by me, and thats not something my anxiety tells me. As I said earlier my parents are a big part of my mental state, they often beat me in the past which pretty much fucked me up and now Im like this cant make friends, antisocial and depressed. And now I really dont know what to do anymore, theres really no one I wanna life for but im too much of a pussy to kill myself so Im here, not willing to do anything but still here. I think I just need some lifting words that motivate me to be brave and keep on going. Sorry for my poor English, Im from germany so its not my mother tongue.",

    "Depression, Depersonalization, Emotional Abuse. HELP. Since about November 2019 Ive started to experience symptoms of depression but i just thought it was some sort of phase or something since Im just a teenager but its now Jan 2021 and those symptoms have constantly been in my brain like they have almost become apart of me. Plus Ive started to experience a few symptoms of depersonalization disorder but once again its only a few and usually I only feel the symptoms to this when Im doing stuff I know my parents would yell at me for. For example one time I smoked weed with some people and In the moment I knew I shouldnt do it and but I felt like telling myself no was just like watching a movie and trying to tell the actor not to do something but what ever you say you cant change the outcome. I didnt get caught but that whole time I felt like I was just on autopilot. Idk if either of my cases could even be diagnosed because I only have a few of the symptoms but these symptoms are persistent but not all that are required to actually have the disorder. I feel like these stem from emotional abuse but once again i feel like the abuse is not like super bad but its there. Like Im consistently told Im the cause of stress in my house and I get yelled at for the littlest things but then an hour later theyll give me a hug and forget it ever happened  this happens everyday. I have a sense of isolation from my family like I live with them but Im like an outsider that doesnt belong. Also I feel like Im forgetting how to be myself like Im usually considered the funny guy or that guy just always knows how to have fun thats but like recently Ive noticed A LOT more of my jokes are missing and me being excited or funny comes off as trying too hard. I dont really know what Im asking for just any advice? So this was saved as a draft about 3 days ago and reading it again makes me realize that my situation is actually a little bit more sever that I thought. I hesitate from posting things like this because part of me feels like Im just doing this for attention. I almost convinced myself to delete this but I mean theres no harm in seeing what people have to say I guess.",
    "Someone else in my skin would be happy, I've no right to be depressed and sinking into alcoholism, yet here I am Im a mid 20s male, college graduate, living in a big city, have a great job. Yet I think about suicide every day. But I feel like I dont have a right to. Other people dont have a lot of the things I have. Im objectively very lucky and have everything I could want to be happy. So why is life so hard? Ive started drinking almost every day. Ill go to the bar alone and drink. Ill drink until I get sleepy. Then I go home, and sleep. The next morning I wake up, go to the gym, and go to work. Then after work I hit the bar again. Alone. Im just so lonely. Why dont people like me. I try not to be an asshole. I really do. I dont think Im an asshole? But I think people are uncomfortable around me. I think I sour their moods. I try not to be negative though. I try really hard. I feel my youth wasting away. I feel the passage of time very heavily. These are supposed to be some great years. Maybe even the best yesrs. Single, big city, acceptably good looking. College certainly wasnt the best years for me. So maybe this is when my life is supposed to peak? But I have no friends. I have no one to hang out with. I dont have a girlfriend. I have no one I connect with deeply. Ive tried cognitive behavioral therapy. But as soon as I stopped going feeling like I was fixed the problems began again. Ive been medicated for depression consistently for years now. Ive even added exercise to my routine at the behest of my doctor. Improved my diet. Stopped smoking weed. I feel like Ive done everything. What can I do now? I feel trapped. I wish I would just die. Life has been very kind to me, and my stupid ass cant take advantage of it.",

I really just want to be able to feel nothing, more out of convenience for my own and everyone elses sake.

I feel more like Im just waiting for everyone to leave just so I can die without fucking anyone up. I know Im quite smart  the only good thing I would say about myself and I kno there are people with lot bigger problems who still keep going but that thought only makes be feel more guilty but I also know everyones pain is still significant, I just go in a constant circle. My only safe space has been my bedroom cause its been the only place I could cry and breathe without being in edge around people.

    "Both me and my spouse are depressed To sum things up, my husband works in retail, Im disabled and cant get disability pay, were poor, but getting by, neither of us have any schooling nor can afford it, he doesnt know what he wants to do if he does go to school, while I feel if I decide to go, it would be a waste of money because I wont be able to work. Plus, theres no guarantee Im mentally fit for it. Neither of us have any drive or passion for life and the only thing really keeping both of us going is each other. Were both obese because hes too tired after work to do anything and my condition is sporadic so its unsafe for me to walk alone. Neither of us even want to go anywhere, anyways. We eat for comfort or when were bored and neither of us can really muster the effort to make food a lot of the time so we subsist on junk. Little things tire us out easily me from my condition, but us both from depression. Im diagnosed and receiving treatment, he isnt. Because of the pandemic, therapy for me is spotty at best  just went three months without therapy and had my first session last week, but my therapist missed our last session earlier this week, so Im worried shes sick again. Getting my husband in for therapy or psychiatry right now is impossible. New patients arent being accepted because paperwork needs to be signed in person. We do have a dog, but he fits in with us way too well. Our dog is afraid of the outside if hes out more than 10 minutes, then demands to be picked up or he wont move. He enjoys car rides and likes being held for walks but my back and heart cant take the position, and he doesnt want my husband to hold him  hes my velcro dog. Then if there are any people, dogs, noises, or wind, he starts to panic, so I do too, he usually helps stabilize my moods, but were both afraid of people so it turns into a feedback loop.",

    "Today I was one step away from killing myself. Today I was one step away from killing myself. Long story short  I had a girlfriend. Weve been best friends for 7 years. The first 2 years I treated her only as a friend, but after 2 years I realized that I fell in love with her. Almost immediately I told her about it and was sent to the friend zone. But every year I fell in love with her more and more. I have never loved anyone so much, and I have never had such a friend. This year she found herself a new boyfriend. And in the end, she said that she no longer has time to communicate with me, and it would be better if we stop communicating. She threw me away like trash. I was left without friends, in a deep depression, absolutely psychologically broken. Every night I fall asleep with the thought that I want to die in my sleep, and every morning I regret that I am still alive. The only thing that keeps me from killing myself is my family. I know that if I commit suicide, my parents will not survive it. But today she posted a photo on Instagram, where her boyfriend picks strawberries, with the caption Happiness is when your man collects strawberries for you while you chill on the bench. And at that moment I was more than ever close to ending my life. For a minute, I stopped thinking about my parents, about anything else, and just wanted to go and cut my throat, or veins. Every day I want to live less and less, because I no longer have a future, there are no hopes and dreams, and I am drowning in darkness and depression. I dont think I can endure this until the end of the year and not end up with my miserable aimless existence. And so that everything is not so depressing  I am absolutely seriously going to get myself 2 tattoos this year a small trash can somewhere on my leg, and the inscription Loser on my arm. Because if I have understood anything over the past 11 years, during which I have visited 8 friend zones, it is that I am a loser, but this year I realized that I am trash",

I have been on antidepressants for 15 years and through so many psychiatrists and therapists but very little has changed.

While shes still alive I continue seeking new ways to help my depression but I am running out of options. So I have been looking into Transcranial magnetic stimulation TMS. Transcranial magnetic stimulation TMS is a noninvasive procedure that uses magnetic fields to stimulate nerve cells in the brain to improve symptoms of depression. Has anyone tried this and I know that its not permanent but I am willing to try.",
    "Chronic Depression and Work Performance Hello. I need someones thoughts or advice. I have several diagnosed illnesses, persistent grieving disorder and pdd with frequent mdes, so thanks brain for the double depression . I am unmedicaded In that past couple months after a huge mde I never quite made it completely out and have been progressively doing worse to a point where my work performance is suffering, Ive received a couple of warnings to get my sh t together not in those exact words but close. Ive never been in such a position where my work ability has lacked because of this. Like I genuinely feel like Im going to either get fired sooner or later or suddenly quit, because of my mental state. I am going to discuss with my psychiatrist medication. We had talked about it before but they basically said we could talk more in detail when I was ready. But a part of me has been considering temporary disability to basically be able to figure myself out, figure out the right meds if necessary, right dosage, etc before putting myself out there to work. I feel so heavy everytime I get ready for the day like what am I going to mess up today and its making everything so much worse. My work frustration is literally dragging me down harder.

The past few years Ive tried my best to support them, love them and hopefully brighten their day a bit, but now Ive come to a point where I feel like I can no longer do anything. I am fully aware that I am not atheir psychologist or therapist and I know its not my job to help them, because quite frankly, I am not qualified to do so.

    "How to cope with loneliness Im struggling with a debilitating level of loneliness which is making me so depressed and anxious that I can barely function. Its awful and its been this way for maybe seven years. I dont have much hope of it getting better I fear as I become older its going to be harder to form connections and Ill be even more isolated than I already am. Ive been trying to listen to a lot of music to connect with to make me feel less lonely. What do you guys do to help cope with loneliness?",
    "I (m17) don’t feel like i have close connections to people; i’m semi-involved in multiple friend groups but i don’t feel like i can truly relate to any of them. am i just taking them for granted? i feel awful about it. starting around age 12 or maybe before but thats the age i can remember thinking ab this stuff ive been a very quiet and reserved person, never really tried to make new friends. ive always been liked by people though for whatever reason, so ive been friends with plenty of different people and different types of people. but i dont have a group of people who i feel like i can connect to. i feel like most of my friendships are relatively surfacelevel, especially when i see others around me who are all really close. now i know its not good to compare myself to other people, but i cant help doing it, its something my mind just does on its own. i am a naturally jealous person  one of the few people who i would consider closer than the rest of the people i talk to invited me to a discord server with a few people he knows irl and they all just seem to get along so well and have a real connection, but i basically never speak there. i feel so distanced. this same friend also keeps telling me about a girl who is a very close friend of his, and the stuff he tells me about just makes it seem like they really care about eachother. its obviously not intentional and im not mad about it, but it feels like a slap in the face because i have such a hard time forming relationships with people. i always feel bad when i feel this way too. like, i 100 recognize how lucky i am that so many people have taken a liking to me, when so many others like me didnt get that privilege. but i feel like its never enough for me. i feel so selfish. i dont even know why im writing this. i guess its some kind of cry for help? but whenever i write something like this i always look back and feel like ive done nothing but whine like a little bitch, and that if i actually tried to talk to anyone instead of crying on reddit i may actually be able to make good friends. i dont know.",
    "Just confused One of my closest friends recently sat me down to commit to improving my depression, which I get. Things were okay. 4 days later he told me we talk too much, but everything is okay. When I asked why the sudden shift in communication. Often my friend would be the one to initiate the conversation, call me first or text me first. It was mutual. We both texted random crap throughout the day. As I dont believe I lost a friend, how do I proceed? Do I give space for a few days and see how things play out? Do I say sorry? Its bugging me of how to fix things.",
    "How do I gain confidence when almost every person I've talked to has put me down for my appearance? Sure Im doing all this self care for myself, but I need to feel accepted by someone. Ive never had a girlfriend, never had a best friend, never had someone I spiritually resonate with. Ive never had anyone. I was physically abused by my father and Ive been completely alone ever since. My entire existence has only been suffering and I dont understand why Id be put here just to feel pain and suffering all while completely alone. I just bottle up all my emotions and pretend it doesnt bother me but of course its eating away at my sanity. I dont have to be gorgeous or the prettiest man but Im just tired of hearing how ugly I am. It breaks my heart so much I can literally feel pressure on my heart just thinking about how wrong Ive been done over the course of my entire life. I guess the main reason I typed this all out is really to ask, how do I keep going even though Im completely alone? How do I keep living knowing that Im all Ive ever had and nobody is there for me? How do I find the motivation to keep being a kind person when all Ive been shown is repulsion for just trying to be myself. How can I find a friend or girlfriend that cares about my opinions and point of view on life without making me feel ugly and worthless. How do I find any reason not to end my life with the gun thats in the room right next to me?",
    "Will it ever go away? (Self Harm/ suidical thoughts-- Trigger warning!) Will it ever go away? I thought that I beat this sht, but what happened last night said otherwise. I have suffering from depression for a whole year! It started last year, 2 semesters ago, with it being compounded with ADHD led to an emotional devastation. It had gotten so bad that I would self harm everynight using an absurdly sharp keys to scratch my upper right arm I am a lefty and one night I decided to cut myself three times using scissors. During that semester I would often write I wrote like Da vinci to make it harder for others to read! things about the emotional pain and that I wanted to die. After the semester was over my mom pressured me to get help. I was put on meds. After awhile and an additional medication I felt better, though took awhile to feel better. Fastforward to today, well last night. When I just bursted into tear and cried myself to sleep, and lately I been having passive suicidal thoughts and I sometimes wish that one night that I will go to sleep and not wake up. In addition, to ADHD and depression I also got GAD and I had a panic attack today YAYYAYAYAYYAY!!. My depression is coming back, and now I have issues with GAD, and the only thing I want is for my depression and GAD to go away! I am tired of suffering, depression and GAD needs fck off!",
    "A bit of a strange case: Exercise has DESTROYED my mental health. Thoughts? Advice? First, some basic health data about myself Age16 SexMale Height 510 WeightAround 142145 pounds Ever since the summer of 2019, exercise has been a huge part of my life. My main fitness goal was gaining muscle, so I was doing strength training with weights around three to four times a week. But I also wanted to be able to eat a lot of food and generally have a relaxed diet at the same time. A big reason for that was because my sister had recently recovered from severe anorexia, so my father thought that it would be wise for me to not trigger her and potentially provoke a relapse by following a restrictive dietby restrictive I mean eliminating junk food, soft drinks, etc. Because of this, I started doing a lot of cardio, and I really mean a lot. I started out with around 30 minutes of running every other day, but I gradually added more cardio over time. My peak was during the summer of 2020, when I was doing around 2 and a half hours of cardio every other day, in addition to 10 minutes of HIIT on my strength training days. When school started, I cut the duration down to the following routine alternating between 1 hour of strength training plus 35 minutes of cardio and 95 minutes of cardio every other day. Then, in January 2021, I got a severe knee injury from doing calf raises. Little did I know the day that I injured myself that, from that point on I would descend into the darkest, most hellish part of my 16 years on this Earth. You have to understand that Id made exercise an essential part of my life. If I didnt complete my exercise, I would fall into a pretty bad mood, sometimes for the rest of the day. So when I injured my knee, I was extremely disappointed. Every form of cardio which Id been doing and enjoyedbiking and running was off the table. Judging from prior experience, swimming was also not an option, because I found itand still do super boring and torturous. My last cardio option was the rowing machine. I replaced my bikingrunning with rowing. The problem was that I HATED rowing, even. more than I hated swimming.",
    "Can't express emotions. As a kid I used to be very talkative and normal I guess. As I grew up I just got very emotionally closed off.

    "I've been alone for so long I think I'm losing communication skills My parents make going out and having fun really difficult especially my step dad who constantly tracks my phone location and my bank information. He makes sure to mention every time I withdraw my own hard earned money from my account making me subconsciously feel wrong just for using my own money. Same thing with going out with my friends, he makes me feel wrong for wanting to have fun, instead he just cares about me working my youth away as a slave for someone else just for this fucking money that I hate so dearly. Its been like this for me basically forever, Ive constantly had elders over me telling me what I should do, what I shouldnt do, things I must seek out, thinks I cant touch with a 10 foot pole etc. and Im sick and fucking tired of it. At no point in my short life have I personally be able to make my own choices or decisions and now that thats been my life when it actually comes to me personally making decisions for myself I dont know how to. It feels like I need someone with me at all times to help me make decisions because Ive never had the opportunity for myself to make decisions, someone else always was more obligated to make decisions for me instead of myself and now Im a complete wreck in life because of it. I think this method of raising me plus child abuse is why I just feel so isolated in this reality now. But now I think all this loneliness in my life is finally starting to add up and take its toll on me. In school from elementary until I hit puberty at around 7th8th grade I was a goofy class clown fun person who had no problem making people laugh and brighten up the whole room. But when my hair started thinning around 9th grade I started to get significantly more and more shy and more depressed and withdrawn from other people out of fear of being judged for being weird or awkward eventually this fear caught up with me my junior and senior years of high school where every single person Id have ever interacted with would judge my appearance or my hair because of how poorly it looked. I felt like I resembled a corpse because of how dead inside I really started to become, and even became more and more obsessed with death and wanting to be dead.",
    "Nothing feels good 22M. Literally nothing feels good. I spend my day solving tediously difficult problems with little resources and poor instructions. Hours of frustration. Eating is just another chore that doesnt bring any joy, unless I eat bullshitjj foods in which case again it will make me feel even worse than the little pleasure it brought me. Masturbating is basically a desperation attempt for something to feel good but honestly its just lack luster, there is no real desire. And if I watch porn it will feel good, but I dont because porn will make me feel even worse after. There is no emotional support from anyone, no one cares about a young mans feelings. Finishing at the gym makes me feel a little good, but its fucking exhausting and the energy and effort I put into it feels as shitty if not more so than the little dopamine I get after. I think this is where my problems with women come in. I want them badly, because sex with women feels awesome. Having a woman around is validating and feels awesome. Cuddling feels awesome. It feels like a woman is the only thing that can bring good feeling into my life without having an immediate and often worse downside. And I know this is problematic thinking. Everything just feels shit. And everything that feels good will make you pay.",

Ive posted about my current situation in other subreddits asking for advice, people dont believe me. I dont know what to do. My posts get removed, I do not know why. Here is my situation, I posted about this on tifu and other subreddits. Throwaway account. This did not actually happen today, this has been a huge progressive fuck up thats been building up steam for months now. Please Reddit I need your help, and advice. Please! Ive been married for 25 years, currently have 4 kids, and let me tell you when youve been married for this long, lots of things can get into your head, shit rattles around there, echoes, ferments in a way that others sometimes just cant comprehend. At times I feel blessed to have been married for so long, but at times living in here Tallahassee, in bum fuck Florida, in a shitty rental just gets to yea, you know? Sometimes the stresses of parenthood can be at times almost suffocating, I hope at least some of you out here, anyone really can just understand where Im coming from. Working as an insurance broker living paycheck to paycheck wasnt my dream job, yet its the one I have to make due with, but I guess all this shit really started just after my 4th son was born, at home my relationship with my wife begun souring. Bills were piling up, and even after long hard days in the office my wife would yell, and cuss at me for wanting to smoke a pack of marlboros, and drink some budweiser in peace in my living room, in the house I pay for like I always would but for some stupid ass reason she flipped on me.",
    "I Need Help sorry for my bad English  This year my life turned upside down when my parents broke up. In my family everyone dislikes me without telling me . I am like their own personal helper. Also everyone in the house is against me , for example when me and my brother fight everyone will help my brother , when i and my mom fight everyone supports my mom because she is always superior from me and the best thing is that sometimes when my older brother fights with my mom they bring me into the topic and start saying things like  he always studies and he will never achieve his dreams  or something like that. And the best part is that i cannot get help , i dont want to speak to my mother and solve the problem , i keep everything inside me. One time i was brought to a hospital to speak to a psychiatrist  the guy that helps you when you have a phonological problem  and i started crying because i learned that when thing get tough start crying. I dont know what to do and i am so shy and antisocial that i cannot even ask a teacher for help. Reddit you are my only hope.",
    "FIRE!!! I cant take anymore stress. Anymore loss. Ive had enough. Ive fallen so deep into a depression that Ive completely let myself go. And I mean completely. I barely have the energy or drive to crawl out of bed. There is no function in my life anymore, Im simply existing. I am pretty much alone now. Ive lost everything. I have had nonstop loss and stress since June of 2018 and its not letting up. Im at the point now to where if Im lucky enough to sleep, Ill wake, up wondering who in my life is going to die that day or what terrible thing is going to happen. ats what it feels like. Like Im outside of myself watching The last straw was the breakup of my 9 year live in relationship. He came home from work and dumped me out of the blue. He moved out 3 days later, leaving me with our large rental house, its utilities and other bills. We split everything and Ive had to take over his share. My elderly mom lives here with me and her income helps but she is ill and is now developing either Dementia or early Alzheimers. I loved my ex so much and his loss alone has nearly put me under. Its been 9 mos since he walked and I found out he had been cheating online. Well thats over and now he has a new girlfriend, my worst nightmare was the day I was going to have to see that. She has money and I really think thats the only reason why hes with her, which is sad. We have stayed in touch mostly by text and he sees our animals we owned together. Now that he has her he no longer wants to see all of our animals and doesnt want to talk to me. He told me it hurts him to talk to me. Yeah right!!! I may be severely depressed but Im not stupid. Add the Covid stress to everything Ive had to deal with and I feel like Im losing it. Ive never gone this long without a shower. Ive never gone days at a time without sleep. Sometimes Ill go 4 days without eating. God help me.",
    "Death Anxiety Hey all. Sorry if this seems unhinged. Im just gonna try to get it all out. In the last month and a half, Ive been having unwanted deep philosophical thoughts on how we perceive time, what the self is, and that we all die eventually. Ive been diagnosed with depression since I was 16 when I first had these thoughts hit me in a big way and Im 27 now. Zoloft has always helped, but Ive been bad about my meds for the last year or so so Im having a relapse, I get this. But the thing is, the stuff Im worrying about feels so real. These arent Im bad, or no one loves me, or I want to hurt other people thoughts. Theyre on a deeper, simpler level. Sometimes I wonder if Im being treated for depression when Im actually just seeing the truths of existence clearer than a lot of other people else and that makes me feel hopeless that Ill ever feel better. Like the system might not be equipped to help me. It makes me so sad. The problem with my worries is that theyre real worries. Im mainly concerned with why do anything at all if were just animals who die. I AM going to die. There probably ISNT a soul. I WILL eventually cease to exist. All the stuff I care about is just electricity and matter and chrmicals in the brain telling me I care about stuff. The I isnt even necessarily real, its just a collection of smaller parts. I know that the classic reddit atheist way of getting through this stuff is just saying life is what you make of it, but when really confronted by the seeming truth that the self will disappear when we die, I guess it just rings kind of hollow. Like, yes of course I love my girlfriend and our pets and my parents and my friends, and I love to make art and perform, I want to go to grad school and get married and have kids. And doing that stuff makes me feel great! But lately Ive just been under this cloud of none of this has purpose even if you pretend it does. Like, Ill feel great doing these things and then Ill think that was nice, but Im going to forget that it happened and cease to exist eventually.",
    "I lost my job and potentially my career due to a deep depression. Hello, I 27F am using my alternative account because there are people who are trying to hurt me with anything they can find out about me. I was diagnosed with Anxiety, depression, and Bipolar disorder at the age of 11 and have always struggled, but I functioned for the most part. A little over a year ago, I was in the darkest place of my life. My dad had just had a major heart attackstrokeaneurism and was destined to die according to doctors he beat the odds with months of comastherapy. My favorite aunt had committed suicide and left my two high school aged cousins motherless. Most terribly though, my ex had blindsided me and illegally started a child custody battle to take my only child, a 7 year old, away from me who I have raised his whole life. I spent all my personal investmentssavings, 15,000, to hire a top attorney and was left broke and completely shattered. My partner was there to support me as much as he could so my son an i had a roof over our head but i was suffering. Shortly before this all happened, I had completed my 1 year internship at a major Financial Firm amp had gained my Series 7 amp Series 66 FINRA licenses. I was so proud of my accomplishments, salary, and stability after 10 years of customer service and sales jobs that did not provide full stability. I was so happy, the happiest I had been in a long time, and then everything came crashing down at the same time. I had an amazingly supportive boss who helped me every step of the way until I exhausted my PTO, UTO, FMLA, Short Term Personal Leave and he had run out of options to offer me. During all this time, I was nothing but a husk. I wouldnt leave my bed, eat, shower, and I spent hours just sleeping. My partner didnt know what to do and Psychiatrist were unavailable due to a large shortage in my city over 6 month waits and up to 9 months. I refused to go to an inpatient facility because I knew it would hurt my child custody case but at the time, that probably would have been the best option. This went on for over 3 months.",

    "Brushing teeth before bed Im not looking for judgement, I know people should brush their teeth twice a day, its just something I struggle with. In the past Ive fell into pretty bad bouts of depression and in the process for some time I couldnt even bring myself to brush my teeth or shower. That was a while ago, not recently. Since then Ive been much healthier and Ive built a solid morning routine where as soon as I get up I shower and brush my teeth. But I keep struggling to build a bedtime routine as normally I just go straight to bed and crash out, sometimes even in my clothes, without brushing my teeth. Any advice?",
    "I got cheated on by my now ex-boyfriend of six years and I feel worthless He said he hadnt loved me for a while. That when he said he wanted to get married that it was just a lie. Through all this I couldnt get him to see that he had lied and cheated. We argued the rest of the way home. At the exit to his apartment I made a comment of how if he cared for the person he was talking to he wouldnt have been a liar. That triggered him. He went into a screaming rage in my face while I was driving on the highway. It was verbal abuse. I feared for my safety in that moment and so I pushed him back. That made him even more enraged and put our lives in danger by grabbing a hold of my steering wheel and attempting to swerve us off the road. I ended up dropping him off at his apartment a few minutes after that and asked for my things back. Since I still had the girl on Snapchat I watched as how he had already rebounded not even after dropping him off. And so now Im just here. Feeling worthless. I cared for him I loved him. But I didnt even recognize him anymore and all I ever wanted to do was help him feel better. He didnt even have a regard for me anymore. He didnt even have the guts to tell me straight forward that he was breaking up with me and masked it with the excuse of needing space. And so Ive been writing this since 523 AM and now its 629 AM. I dont know how to feel. But I feel worthless.",

    "Stuck between moving forward and killing myself Some background information My GF of almost 3 years broke up with me over half a year ago and ever since I have been severely depressed. It wasnt a bad breakup, just a sad one. Shortly after the breakup, I noticed I wasnt dealing with it well at all. I couldnt do anything but cry and wishing she would come back. I went to a psychologist and he diagnosed me with Major Depressive Disorder MDD. I still had friendly contact with my ex, but I was just hoping she would come back. After an emotional call, she told me to take a few months for myself. And so I did, but I just got worse. I couldnt do anything. I stopped working, studying, playing sports, everything, because I had no energy or motivation for it. I almost got admitted to a psych ward, but it was still my choice to do stay there or not. I chose to not do it as I had a bad feeling about it. October of last year, I contacted her again and we met for the first time in months. It was supposed to just be friendly, but talking about the relationship was inevitable. She said to me she would never take me back. She wasnt angry, but just serious and honest. It broke me even more. The next day I sent her a goodbye text and was close to killing myself. She called just in time and we had a good talk. Though a few weeks later, when things look better and we actually had made plans to meet up as friends, I got a panic attack and sent her emotional texts. She sent me a long one back and then blocked me. I then attempted suicide again, this time getting hospitalized. I have not directly spoken to her since. It was either via other people or letters. Last December I sent her a suicide letter, but I quickly regretted it. My brother sent her a message for me, apologizing to her and telling her Im okay. Then for Christmas, I sent her a simple card, but never got a response nor did I expect one to be honest.",

In truth, Im not doing well. My depression is very much chemical and not situational. I feel like crying all the time for straight up no reason. I feel like...how much more can I try?

    "I need help with hygiene This is probably the most embarrassing post Ive ever made, but I need help. Ive been working my way through a depressive episode for the past couple months, and I thought I was doing fairly good with it, since Ive been showering fairly often at least every other day and eating at least once a day, but recently one of my friends messaged me privately to ask if I was okay, because the last few times he saw me, he said he smelled a strong body odor and it was making him not want to be around me. I immediately went and bought some mens deodorant since it tends to be stronger, but I was hoping someone might have a better way for me to combat this. Honestly Im just upset that I let it get bad enough for people to notice, and I keep wondering how many people have been choosing to just say nothing and deal with it. Any help that yall can give me would be great thank you so much for your time!",
    "How did you explain to a medical professional you need more than therapy? I know there is no comparison and each suffering is unique to their own person, but how did you explain in a way you got medical help beyond therapy? I always feel like maybe I dont look at the right places that my depression isnt as serious as it seems in medical advices available and my healthcare have only been asking for me to do therapy when I have had months to years of lethargy stuck in bed passing out due to anxiety memory blanks little motivation little self care from the normal brief thoughts of self harm.

    "I feel so empty Its been nearly four months since my dog passed. And Ive had maybe a handful of good days. I cant even make a ham sandwich without getting upset sometimes. Ive been up since midnight and I cant get back to sleep. My sleep patterns are all over the place. Setting a set time for sleep just adds to my stress. And the. My anxiety goes all haywire. I did start one of my hobbies back up, but I noticed I can easily get lost in it and blow time I need to do chores or run errands. And while its good distraction , it hasnt gotten its joy back yet. Just finding a new routine without my caregiving duties, and especially without mymy Moms dog has just been hell. Nothing feels as good and any step I take is without them. I literally got a slight raise at work, and the first person I wanted to tell, I couldnt because shes gone. Its like I cant even be happy with anything because I dont have anyone to share it with who cares. Even when my dog was here, I still felt pride that I was doing good for her and making her life a little better. I dont know. Life just isnt as fun without them. And while I dont feel suicidal, every thing just feels like motions and so dull. Sorry to post yet again, the sad anxiety just really gets to me.",
    "How do I stop the fear of getting too attached to people? Hi everyone, A bit brave for posting this on my main, but here it goes. My attachment to people is a big issue. It has definitely led to heart ache, sadness, and disappointment. So  I got this great job a couple of months ago, every day was a challenge and something new. My colleagues are great people  I genuinely love speaking to them, and just overall having a good time. But  I have an issue of getting too attached to people and not interpreting signals correctly. This eventually leads to the other party to not dealing with me anymore I dont really blame them to be honest and just... cutting me off. This has eventually developed into me not opening up  or being personable with people as I am simply too scared of this attachment growing. Sometimes they message me out of work We all have each other on social media, big mistake on my end! and I just leave on seen or reply blandly, or sometimes in the middle of a conversation I just never reply, simply because I feel like this will go down the same road as before, just being too attached. Every day I struggle keeping myself composed I take photos just to get my head off things, this is the only thing that gets me going through the weekend. Should I tell this to my colleagues? Should I keep it a secret? I really dont know. At the end Im just not happy with how I am. I get suicidal ideations every single night and just remembering the relationshipsfriendships that I have fucked up literally gives me anxiety and it has definitely caused some sort of trauma. I dont go through with suicide because I just think of my parents on how sad they will be. But  once my parents pass away I am planning to fully commit as I really dont want to live this crippling anxiety with every single relationshipfriendship.",

    "Does this qualify as depression? Recently a pattern in my behavior has become very clear to me. Whenever I dont have a structure in my schedule to keep me busy, out of the house, and socializing, I begin to fall apart. My hygiene suffers, I sometimes go a week without showering or brushing my teeth. The amount of dry shampoo I use is scary. I always end up binging, with food and television. I was doing great all summer with a healthy diet, exercising, losing weight. Then my summer job ended. Now I spend the majority of my time watching show after show and mindlessly eating while I do it. Whenever im alone in the house and not distracting myself with food, tv, or porn I just end up pacing around, staring out the window melancholically like a antidepressant tv ad. Ive had a therapy consultation at my college where we primarily discussed my potentially having ADHD and my struggles with feeling guilty about my academic underperformance. I mightve gotten to talking about whether Im depressed, but I never actually had a session, they were booked until the end of the year. Im just looking for some answers, thinking about trying to find a therapist, but the only local source has had many questionable testimonials.",
    "Does it ever really get any better? Ive been dealing with depression for a long time, several years. I only recently started trying to fix it and started taking some meds which Ive been on for about 3.5 months now. Whats the point of it all? I come home from work now and for no reason just feel totally useless and like I dont matter. At least before the meds I was numb and didnt feel this way. Im finding myself almost in tears at work, for no reason at all. Earlier this week I came home, sat down on my couch and just started to cry. All week Ive had 0 motivation to do anything. I still ended up going to the gym for a couple yoga classes hoping it would at least make me feel a bit better, it didnt. I just want to know if this will ever get better?

    "26. Depressed, socially anxious, lost and suicidal. I spent most of the money I made with my dad on weed. This is how life was for about 8 years. Around 2013 i began taking lexapro and took it until Feb 2019 but it didnt really help. My oldest brother ended up overdosing form heroin 4 years after I graduated high school. I had a moment where i said to myself enough is enough, stop smoking, get your shit together and do something with your life but that was short lived. A year after that we moved to Florida. This move didnt really fuck me up as much as the first one but it did affect me a little as I do not like change in general. My drinking increased since I moved down here and I smoked just as much. Fast forward to November 2019. I turned 26 and holy shit it hit me like a ton of bricks. I had a huge quarter life crisis and realized that the past decade of my life flew by so fast and I spent it doing absolutely nothing. I stopped smoking and stopped drinking after doing both habitually for at least a decade. I told myself I could not live like that anymore and if I didnt make a change sooner of later I would look back a decade from now and have the same regrets. I began considering joining the service but honestly had no clue what I wanted to do for a career and I still dont. I just felt like doing anything has to be better than doing nothing and it might help me out of my socially anxious depressed bubble that I am in. Unfortunately around mid November I began suffering from severe dry eye which i am still dealing with as i type this. It has cost me an insane amount of money in doctors visits and i still havent gotten better. I had lasik 4 years ago and it might be the cause dont get lasik. This only has made me more depressed and suicidal. I also went to a cheap therapist for about a month during this time. I also went to a psychiatrist and took Zoloft for about a month and a half without any improvement and stopped because of fear that it would make my dry eye worse. One of the only positive things that has happened recently is I began talking to a girl i met on a dating site.",

Im really nervous about getting a job again as i havent had a real one that entire time am I just overthinking it or will it be not as bad as i think.",
    "Staying POSITIVE is ALREADY hard and now I am the caregiver to a SUICIDAL FRIEND I was pretty much unsure what to do so I wrote a letter to the family secretly I know where she stays and i made sure to text her mum that I had put a letter outside their house gate. They eventually texted back to express their gratitude but I did not hear from them afterwards... So again, she had her bouts of episode and meltdowns and I had to calm her down every single time. it gets exhausting for me as well. And I always feel that I am trying to fight against absorbing and feeling down from all of these. Recently, she went for a staycay and her mum called me. She was begging me to ask my friend to cancel it to which i have no influence on at all since my friend was really optimistic about this she initially had plans to kill herself during this trip but after meeting another psychologist, she kind of is delayin it. When her mum called me a second time, i was with my friend and my friend was really on the edge. She tried taking my phone away from me to talk to her mother but I stopped her. Her mum SAID thru the phone since i didnt know she is with you and you are still going to allow her to go for the staycay, ALL is on you. YOU SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY IF SMTG HAPPENS TO HER. I DONT CARE but you make sure she is safe. I was quite upset by this but politely ended the call as my friend tried grabbing the phone away from me. Ended up, she called her mum back only to shout and scream at her mum  berating the mum for calling me. Her mum was upset. The mum texted me and blamed me for my friends action. I replied to her saying I was sorry that that happened and that I tried calming my friend but she went hysteria instead. The mum later replied telling me that since my friend does not listen to her as a mother, i should be the one doing the advice and guiding my friend to the so called right path. She said that she leave me to take care of my friend for her. Im speechless guys.. I am so exhausted already but yet this happened??",
    "What do I say to people who ask what's wrong? Im in a funk. No real reason why. Nothing has set me in a downward spiral. In fact, I should be super happy since we just bought a new house that I love. I AM happy about it. I love my house. But here I am again having no energy for personal relationships, fighting the urge to end all of my friendships because I just dont want them. Its not urges to just end the friendships, but destroy friendships, burn all bridges. My work was being affected and I took a day off on Tuesday just because I didnt want to be there. I have never taken a day off for no reason. I am sure this will pass and Ill be fine again. But what do I do in the meantime? What do I say when people ask if everything is ok? Or when they say something is up with me? There is literally nothing for me to be upset about right now. I am afraid I am going to come off whiny or just self pitying.",

Im too lazy to even look for a therapist or reply to some people on WhatsApp. Im currently not working bc it had become impossible to do my job bc of my depression. Ive tried working out and hanging out with friends. But I hate working out at home, and I still feel depressed. Crying while Im working out. And then feeling hopeless that it doesnt make me feel any better bc it always used to. When Im with friends I feel annoyed or empty. I dont enjoy anything anymore. Which scared me. Please dont give me advice about how I should just pick up a book or go outside and work out. Or meditating or journaling. I just cant seem to do it, otherwise I wouldve had done it already.

    "Does anyone else feel like the world is incredibly dark? Ive never been treated nicely by anyone. Even the kids that are more rejected by other kids are mean to me. Ive never been mean to a single person in my life but i get treated like shit constantly. I dont know why but when I was a kid I imagined the world was a place full of empathy but literally every single person Ive met has been an unempathetic piece of shit. Im in a friend group thats so toxic it led one of the kids in our friend group to a suicide attempt with a gun but it ended up missing his brain I imagine he got scaredd and moved it at the last second. And even AFTER he attempted and was in the hospital they continued to treat him like shit and told him he shouldve just gone through with it. Dont worry, they also treat me like shit, Im in a similar position to him and I cant leave because I have no other friends. Not only that, but I treat the guy that attempted suicide with absolute kindness, Ive never been mean to him which youd expect him to be thankful for right? Nope, he actually treats me like shit more than the other kids and he even fought me a month ago simply because he hates me that much. And its not like I have a bad personality, Im extremely funny in groups of people, like its not uncommon for me to have people tearing up cause they laugh so much, but everyone still hates me and treats me like dirt. Im not exaggerating here, but when I imagine the world outside my bedroom I genuinely imagine darkness and madness everywhere. Imagine nightmare on elm street dreams where every house is empty or whatever and its always night outside and theres just a feeling of terror. Also every person I talk to feels fake, conversation is impossible. I genuinely feel like Im living in a make believe world at this point Im scared as shit.",

    "Self-Improvement help After 2.5 years of living with my girlfriend she left. I dont want to get much into detail but up until some months ago relationship was great, then we started having some minor issues, which bummed me out a little. I never told her about it its no big deal, I cant justify being mad about this little thing... I thought. Of course you can figure that these minor issues only began to grew, pushed us apart and ultimately killed the relationship. When we recently talked about this it was already too late, but upon openly talking about the matter I understood her behaviour much better. Probably, if we had talked about that way sooner we could have saved the relationship. The problem is, it is not the first time I do that. I have had previous relationships die for the same reasons. So here I am once again, depressed because my fear of confrontation killed what was the best relationship, by far, that I have ever had. She was such a great girl and I fucked up everything. I also believe that it was not only lack of communication  confrontation fear. When things were going bad the thought of breaking up was constantly in my head. Again, I never told her about it nor decided to take the step myself. This is probably because I dont have many friends and fear solitude. There are a lot of times already when I feel lonely, especially during the latter months, and I didnt want to make matters worse. However, I am almost sure that having this constant break up thought made me unconsciously sabotage the relationship and be more distant. Of course, talking about this stuff earlier on would have probably helped. I am fed up with this, I know that keeping things to myself and other similar behaviours of mine are only going to keep destroying relationships, but its like I cant help it. As I said this is not the first time this happens to me and would probably not be the last one if I dont force myself to change.",
    "What would be the best way to talk to my S.O. about getting help tomorrow when it's a really upsetting subject for her even though she needs it? She tells her parents who are doing a very shit job at looking after their daughter btw that shes just not feeling well or she pretends to eat and gets away with it. She also has terrible mood swings, one minute shes happy, joyful, playful, laughing, the next shes depressed, crying, suffocating herself in her blanket, cutting herself..... this is all over facetime because her parents are not allowing me to see her as they are very strict so her mood just changes out of nowhere and whenever I try to bring up her needing help or asking if somethings wrong she gets really upset. Shes terrible at taking care of herself and has proclaimed many times I hate myself, thats why but never goes into detail. She names many things about herself that she hates but I dont think those are why she does everything she does, and if it is thats why I suggest for her to get help but she refuses all the time. She never eats, never drinks water, barely sleeps, does everything she can when shes sick to make herself worse such as drinking coffee and staying up, she never takes her medication, she purposely hurts herself, she doesnt open up, she doesnt respect her own values and boundaries, hell she threw away her inhaler because of whatever reason but she needs it so she doesnt die from a coughing fit due to her thyroidism, which she doesnt do anything to help either. She never allows herself to warm up when shes cold, she suffocates herself in a blanket, she doesnt take her meds for it, its sad more than it is upsetting if Im being honest. Lately she has been getting rid ofblocking out people who are helping her, which is why Im glad I convinced her to let me talk to her about this tomorrow, but anyways she convinced her stupid ass useless parents that she doesnt need a therapist anymore, she doesnt tell her doctor anything, she doesnt open up to her parents understandable because they get mad or brush it off.",
    "I suffer from persistent depression and my GF wants to leave me. I 39M suffer from persistent depression. Even as a kid Ive been depressed, bullied and have felt unloved and flawed due to a difficult upbringing and undiagnosed ADHD. I suffered from this well into my adulthood. Feeling broken and flawed. About three years ago I got diagnosed with ADHD and being in a bad situation with work and a bad breakup after a very long relationship led to depression diagnosis. I got CBT and was put on ADHD meds that helped out a bunch with my ADHD. Now on to my current situation and my reason for this post About 2,5 years ago I met this great girl and we hit it of in a long distance relationship. Shes loving, positive and very helpful. She can be short tempered though and has some insecurities. Unfortunately my work situation went from bad to worse and I just couldnt do it anymore. I got help and this led to some more help from a shrink but I was put on hold for almost two years now and I never felt so lonely, sad and depressed. Also the Covid19 pandemic did not help things either. Right now I am seeing another shrink and a psychiatrist that is helping me out with my ADHD meds. At this moment I am so tired and feel like I can not enjoy things anymore. I feel resentful and frustrated. Obviously I am in a bad place and this unfortunately damaged my relationship and my sweet girlfriend. I noticed her pulling away from me, getting frustrated with me and or irritated. At times Ive gotten the silent treatment. Sometimes I acted out in a way that hurt her in stressful situations or moments where I felt like Ive failled. Like forgetting important things, not doing something or being late again and again. She got mad or gave me the silent treatment. My anxiety got the better of me. Offcourse we talked, and that was difficult at times. I felt sad, misunderstood and she made it clear that she felt talking about it was a bad thing. Last night she told me she did not see a future for us in that way.",
    "Are antidepressants the nuclear option? Hi, I was in a serious car accident recently and walked away but Im left with some long term health issues that will take months to resolve because of waiting lists UK based. The health issues mean I cant take part in my main hobby as Ive been told that partaking in that hobby will lead to a worsening of the medical issue and lead to permanent damage. Over the last few weeks, Ive been struggling. Im low and on the verge of tears all day every day. I cant concentrate, I have brain fog, I forget what Im doing constantly, I have real trouble making any type of decision. I have a stressful job which requires me to be at my best, and Im not managing it very well. I take no enjoyment in anything I do, Im avoiding family and friends. The more time that passes, the worse I feel. Im guilty that I dont feel relieved that the outcome wasnt worse, Im angry that someone elses other drivers poor decision making has put me here. My friends and family my partner in particular are worried about me as I am not myself, I feel guilty about this too but cant bring myself to feel normal so I avoiding speaking to them. Im on a waiting list for counselling, and Ive been having regular catch ups with my doctor, but this week I spoke with someone new and within 5 minutes of speaking to me for the first time, she told me my symptoms suggested depression and prescribed antidepressants with a suggested minimum course of 1 year. I have a family history of depression, but this is the first time that I have been here, and medication feels like a huge step, especially seeing as she mentioned taking them for a year. I just want to get back to feeling like myself again, but what I have heard about antidepressants suggests that they wont be the magic fix.

    "I have a problem with getting mental help. My parents are a bit off. If their friend or a family member needs help, they will put their entire life on hold. But if their kids need help, its rarely done. Ive tried for months to get them to make a few doctors appointments. Specifically my psychiatrist. But no matter how many times I ask, it never gets done. In fact, about six months ago, I went to the dentist to get some cavities filled. I had cavities on the top and bottom sets, so, they said that we would have to come to two separate appointments to properly get them filled. Well, we went for the top set, and Ive asked my parents to schedule the second appointment ever since. However, my main concern is going to a psychiatrist. Mainly because for about two and a half years now, Ive had problems with the way my brain functions, and my grasp on reality. I just havent felt right. But in that time, I never considered going to a psychiatrist because i had been to one before, and they did prescribe me medication, so I thought that if there was something wrong, they would have found it years prior. But i spoke with some friends about it and they told me it would be smart to go back. That was a few months ago and I havent been able to convince my parents that I should go back. Its not a financial issue, my insurance covers everything And its not a time issue, neither of my parents are working. My parents are the There aint nothing you cant fix yourself type, and dont understand much about mental help. Its getting so bad that my mother wont hardly talk to anyone because shes either too lazy, to too buried in some kind of device to do anything. Then, when I ask my aunt or grandparents for help, my parents get pissed and complain about how I make them look bad. Dont get it wrong though, they are great in most other regards, but when it comes to me actually needing help, they really dont do much. When it comes to real responsibilities, they are just all around lazy. If anything cant be solved within a minute or two, they wont hardly even look in its direction.",

I have a friend teenager, he is good at anything specifically, he doesnt have hobbies, nor does he have anything he wants to do... and naturally depression kicked in, noone noticed for a while, I personally found out about it being serious just about... 3, maybe 4? hours ago... he sent me a message saying bye, im suiciding which on its own, with no context, seemed as a stupid stupid joke... so naturally I said that this isnt a topic to joke about, and eventually put some things together He doesnt have hobbies  goals, He smokes recently started which is horrible imo, he drinks , and he was known to have been overly depressed before, but nothing came out of it, it seemed like he had a rougher time with small things, I started to get worried so I digged deeper... talked with a few common friends and only 1 was able to be of help, the friend suicidal had plans... everything. step. by. step. It was actually pretty .... yikes idk... scary, and I got to talk with him, explained to him as nice as one could, that he needs, and he agreed, and said, what about telling your parents? they sure will helped. what followed had me mute. litterarly. HE DID! and his dad is an alchoolic that doesnt care, overall a cool guy to have a drink with and have some fun talk, but not a dad. for sure not. and his mother seemed really active and protective, which she isnt... he told his mom about his issues, and she said well you better get on studying and stop with this bad word poopoo . Which pretty much dug him even further into the hole he is in, I cant help but want to do something, I wont be telling his parents more because I am afraid that he will be punished for speaking his problems out loud, which is wrong, but keeping in mind his parents, not surprising, anything I can do for him?!?",

    "My friend has been having lots of suicidal thoughts lately. I have known him for a year now, and hes studying abroad rn and Im still study at our homeland. He has been telling me about how he wants to kill himself lately, and reply less and less to my texts, or sometimes he just straight up ignored my texts and then came back with a text about killing himself. He has never talked about dying this much throughout the whole time weve known each other. I tried to talk to him, make him feel loved and other things that I think that can help him clear his mind a bit, but I dont really know if that can help him or not because hes so far away. He used to use antidepressants but he has stopped for quite a while now and he once confessed to me that he doesnt want to visit therapist or use antidepressants again. Can any of you here help me with some advice please? He is a close friend of mine, and Id die if he decides to stop living. Thank you in advance.",
    "Depression and anxiety making it difficult to do work Im depressed and anxious a lot, especially because I need to write a report for work. Its the end of my work term its a summer research job and my results arent great. Its been an awful summer and I cant face this report.

    "Any other depressed mental health professionals out there? Im wondering if theres anyone here who can relate... I am on my doctoral internship which, is my last step towards getting my doctorate in clinical psychology. I had to move 1000 miles to start my internship which is obviously stressful because Im away from everything familiar and my support system. And its stressful because Im stepping into new role working 40 hours a week as a professional, rather than being a student and working part time. And my anxiety has affected my work. And the more my supervisors have provided what was intended to be constructive criticism the more I have felt like a worthless piece of s. And the more Ive messed up, the worse their criticism has gotten. And now my supervisors want to meet with me next week. Pretty sure Im going to be put into some kind of remediation. Or fired. And I feel like such a worthless failure I dont think I can make it through this year. And I cant help but think that my life is over, and I should just be done with this. My 8 years of education in psychology and hundreds of hours of therapy have not helped me get away from the feeling that I am worthless as a human being. I know where it comes from, but that doesnt solve things. I cant use cognitive restructuring to think myself out of how I am feeling. I have tried and Ive tried and I dont know if I can do it anymore. Sometimes I think Im going to be OK, I think I can pull myself out of this. But wondering if theres anyone out there who can also understand what its like to understand themselves on an intellectual level but still feel completely unable to fix their selfdestructive behavior? Any therapists who can pay attention to their patients needs and then be unable to meet their own, or who wonder how they can help clients when their clients are more healthy than they are?",
    "27 yo Male, living with parents, having some family small businesses but personally having insignificant involvment. Dating an older women from other town. What should I do ? Hello everyone, I think about myself as an old child, unable to launch. Even though I started my own company, and began developing wordpress based websites, I havent earned much my whole life. I feel like a total st. For about a month Ive met a girl in a nearby city, who is 5 years older than me. She has a stable job with a much better income than mine, but she pays for rent and says that she cant save any money. Both of us are the only children our parents have. She wants a child soon, so she is looking for commitment, but on the other way, she says that she is not willing to limit any of my freedom. I was through a couple of bad relationships and I am not into hooking up randomly and not even dating anymore. I am very very frustrated and I dont know what should I do. Should I leave my parents, even if they need my help from time to time, take the nothing that I have and move with her? I am not confident, my schedule is a mess, I have a big problem waking up in the morning and I have no idea what to do. I sometimes wonder if I am semiretarded, or having some autistic spectrum disorder. I had problems with weed and alcohol and I incline towards addiction most of the time. I am stressed out nowadays because I have work which needs to be done, very limited time and little to no money. PLEASE HELP!! !",
    "Is This Wrong, or is My Mind Sabotaging Me? My depression really didnt manifest significantly until fourish years ago, when I was on my way out of high school. Having depression in college feels absolutely impossible. I find that I never have the motivation to complete my coursework and I lose interest quickly. Im in a degree right now that I thought would be good but now it doesnt feel right anymore. I just cant tell if Im unhappy because Im doing the wrong thing, or if my mental illness is robbing me of the passion I need to enjoy my program. But I dont have the time or the money to keep taking semesters off and swapping programs. I also dont want to realize five years from now that I fought through a degree I hated waiting for an improvement that never came. I just wish I could trust my mind to make the right decisions.",
    "A therapist doesn’t want to see me because I have trauma. What the fuck. I feel so confused. I had a consultation with a potential new psychotherapist yesterday, to which she told me we should both take 24 hours to think amp see if were both a good fit, to which I was fine with even though I already had my mind made up based off of the description of servicesexpertise she had listed on her website. After the 24 hrs passed, I havent heard back from her, so I emailed her following up about our session, and stated Im confident with moving forward with them, just for her to email me back basically stating that she doesnt feel shes a good fit for me since I have CPTSD, and how shes still an intern, meanwhile she CLEARLY states all of her credentials, some mentioning acute AND complex trauma! Along with helping marginalized communitiesLGBTQ. I should note Ive seen two other counselors at this practice, but unfortunately cant see them due to changes in insurance. They were the ones who referred me to this therapist. I feel so alone and its been SO difficult finding help. This was a kick in the gut for me.",
    "When I encounter problems, even not so big, my mind automatically goes to “I just want to die. Would all the pain and stress go away if i just die?” Has anyone else felt like this? Even little things seems to trigger my desire to just die. The stress of buying a home is triggering these thoughts. I feel stupid for wanting to die every time bad things or inconveniences happen to me. Whats wrong with me? If i just shoot myself w a gun or die of a horrible car accident, all my problem and stress would just go away. I wouldnt have to worry about being all these problems in my life. The only thing stopping me are my kids and husband. Whos gunna take care of them? My kids cant grow up without a mom. But idk how much longer I can continue.

    "Tired of Choosing between Bills and Food Hey everyone, I posted this in rfinancialhelp As well but this is also really taking a hit to my sanity.. Im really having a difficult time getting my finances in order. Back in January my fiancée 21F and I 21M moved into our first apartment. Ever since then we have been struggling to get money to save and even pay our bills. We both work full time and both make over minimum wage where we live. Honestly I dont really know how else to say this so Im just going to say it how it is. She comes from a wealthier family and sometimes has trouble with spending habits. This is something that we have both discussed and its something that she agrees is an issue. Right now we are both in debt she used my credit card without my knowledge for a while and also promised she would pay me back whenever she did ask me to use it, which didnt happen, and now I feel really cornered with my finances. Ive been trying to pay the debt off for months but we struggle to even get enough for our monthly bills. Aside from that we dont even have much food either and I dont eat much as a result. Im just really struggling with this right now because I want us to be able to start saving money and be able to afford things and starts saving and investing but with the debt and the money issues we are facing it just feels kind of impossible right now. Any advice is welcome. IMPORTANT NOTE The apartment we live in is well within our budget, we didnt choose to live somewhere really fancy.",
    "26. Depressed, socially anxious, lost and suicidal. Since i was a little boy I have always been shy. The problem is I never really grew out of it. I have always sheltered myself from doing normal things that probably would have helped me break out of my shell. Now i am 26 and I cant stop dwelling on all of the experiences and fun I have missed out on because of my depression and social anxiety that i had and still have. Even as a little kid I had this problem. For example almost every first day of school I had I cried and wanted to go home. Even at a few of my birthday parties i cried. My parents tried to get me to play football and i even was told i was going to be the quarterback but I stopped going before the season even started because I was afraid and embarrassed to say hike in front of my parents. Looking back I just wish i could be happy like everyone else. I also feel like I lived in the shadow of my 3 older siblings and a lot the energy and focus of my parents was on them, my oldest brother especially. One of the happiest times of my life was the 6th grade, I was in the cool clique at school. I had a lot of friends, one of them being a girl I had a crush on for a couple years before that and I had a lot of confidence and finally began slowly coming out of my shell. After that school year my parents sold our house and we moved to a different town. I knew my parents wanted to move for a while and honestly it was my biggest fear. This devestated me. I literally was in fetal position crying for at least 2 weeks after we moved into the new house. I went from a happy kid to a suicidal 12 year old within a short amoumt of time. Like i said always dealt with shyness and depression but I feel like this put me way back into a hole I could not get myself out of and has turned me into the man i am today. I spent the next 2 years in middle school wanting to end my life. A big part of my brain focuses on high school and that fact that I pretty much did nothing during it besides smoke weed and drink.",

    "To everyone who actually took time to read this, thank you for caring for me, a random stranger who probably doesn't deserve getting much help anyways. My mom just got high blood pressure today. And its my fucking fault. Since I dont live with my mom or my dad, I live with my married sister and her family. My parents visit me a few times a year, and recently, my mom was able to come over to Cali since the state she lived in was going to close due to Covid, and she wanted to take advantage of this time and spend more time with me. She comes over, goes into quarantine for 14 days, and everything peachy. Well, when my mom realized I was still hurting myself, she got really concerned, and made it her lifes mission to help me get out of this depression, which I had lied about and said Im fine. Dear Mom, I want to let you know that I really love and appreciate you, but for some reason, I just cant bring myself to tell you. Im sorry. Within the several days, my mom really tried to help me. But I was always bitchy towards her, saying I was fine, and I yelled at her. My mom, she cried sometimes, but she just didnt let me see her doing that. But I could always hear it. And being me, I couldnt swallow down the part of me that hated her, for leaving me and making me grow up faster than all my friends, who had happy families and happy parents, and had the love and emotional support they needed from their own. I was always the one that stuck out, who had to depend on friends instead of my guardians, because they always insisted they were right, and I was wrong. I could never bring myself to talk to the people who supposedly loved me because I always feel like theyre lying, that its their obligation to take care of me, and that they only view me as a waste of space and money and so much time. I got depression around the age of 11, but I just never bothered to get myself help until I was close to really cracking down from all the stress and anger Id hold in from all my encounters with my sister and her husband.",
    "Feeling frustrated/numb for no good reason? A week ago I had an argument with someone close and it kind of escalated. We worked things out and everything is fine. The problem is that Ive been feeling frustrated and numb ever since. I have barely any energy and am just proud that I get out of bed in the morning. Whenever I genuinely feel something it is a mix of anger against myself and frustration. What would you do to overcome this? At the moment I am not interested in a therapist. Not too long ago, I had bad experiences with a psychologist that caused major trust issues. Before I seek professional help, I will have to come to terms with this. Any suggestions on how to get better?",
    "How do I gain confidence when almost every person I've talked to has put me down for my appearance? I feel so fucking hopeless, even though Ive been working out, trying to gain some healthy weight and muscle, naturally a quiet but nice person who genuinely cares what people think and how they feel. Been adding protein and healthier food options, and attempting to add more daily calories to my diet as to help me look less skinny and more healthier and fit. But at the same time its honestly for nothing, Im worthless and people make sure to remind me of that. I dont know how I was placed on this earth for basically every single person Ive spoken to, to make me feel like a worthless piece of shit. Im only 19 and I feel so fucking ugly, Ive been told by the nicest prettiest girls that I, Look like an old man. on multiple different occasions. Do you realize how fucking painful that is? Imagine if I told that same girl, You look like a 50 year old lady. I fucking guarantee you shed have been heartbroken from hearing that. How the fuck am I the only person in the world who thinks about how my words can possibly hurt someones feelings? Am I the only person who thinks before they speak? My own family has teased my appearance including high school teachers. Ive heard friends of mine overhearing teachers making fun of me behind my back. My OWN friends make fun of my appearance straight in my face. Its impossible to have self confidence when youve literally been proven to be fucking hideous, people dont tease me to share a good laugh. They do it because Im genuinely ugly and nobody cares about how depressed I am and how I have literally not a single person to talk to. I cant get suicide out of my head I dont wanna live with other humans if theyre just gonna make me feel shunned and worthless. I really dont know what to do. Ive tried to make myself the best person I can be but nobody gives me a crumb of appreciation. All my hard work literally doesnt mean anything to anyone and nobody cares. Sure Im doing all this self care for myself, but I need to feel accepted by someone.",
    "Feeling so down and beating myself up for mistakes I dont feel like talking about whatever is going on in my post since it might be too long. So to simplify it I made a mistake asking someone from a laptop repair shop to back up files onto a hard drive. I didnt think too much about what I did so of course I wasnt surprised when my parents were mad at me. I tried to fix the situation by calling and texting to let them know of the situation. Then my mom just starts calling me out and calling me names cause I kept making mistakes. I get that I dont think through things sometimes and it gets to me, but my mom really tried to drag me through the dirt cause she thinks so highly of her golden child compared to me. It got to me and I fought back verbally. I was so mad at her at that moment and couldnt believe the things that she said. Im now sure that whatever my mom said is going to and will affect me. I just barely have the motivation to do anything at the moment. As you can tell, Im probably not doing so well and would be down to talk or chat with someone.",
    "i had to say goodbye to my sweet boy today after finding out yesterday cancer is ravaging his body. the vet said he has never seen anything like what was shown on those scans, that my sweet maximus was a very very sick little boy. the inside of his spleen was supposed to look like peanut butter, but instead it looked like chunky jelly with chunks and lumps he could not identify. his body had developed multiple tumors, which were cancerous. he had gone into tumor lysis crisis meaning that a large amount of the cancer cells that were comtained in these tumors died, and released their cancerous contents into his blood. they were killing his red blood cells and destroying the ability to regenerate any at all. his stomach had bloated 3x its normal size, even though it was just later in the day and yesterday morning it had looked fine. the vet discouraged us from treatment because he didnt see any possible way maximus could recover putting him on treatment would only prolong his suffering and ensure he passed painfully. which is cruelly ironic, as putting him on treatment would keep my suffering at bay. but i have to do right by my boy. hes been through too much and endured more than i can imagine, he was brought into this world in pain and i promised him when i brought him home he would leave it in love. i had to keep that promise. i love him more than it seems like my heart can handle, and making the right decision for him is the absolute utterly wrong decision for me. we got the vet this morning and despite not moving except to lift his head the past few days, he trotted off away from the building. i believe in the deepest place of my heart he knew what we were there for, and he was scared. he wouldnt let me turn him around back toward it, and the most he would take was two steps toward the building and then sit back down. i sat down with him and just sobbed. the thought of not having that big brown baby rips my heart into shreds and pierces my soul. we finally got him inside after i just sat with him and talked to him for about 15 minutes. ive never wanted to simply wait in a waiting room longer, but they called us right back.",

I recommended he find some hobbies...but he doesnt want to. I told him to try making new friends, he says he already has me... I tried to explain why that wouldnt be healthy and he seemed to try to say that other people will just hurt him...but Im not perfect... I cant provide for all of his emotional needs...

    "I feel like I don't deserve to be sad, but I am. I understand this may seem silly. Everyone has their own issues and struggles, their own obstacles and problems, etc. But I truly have a very blessed life, I am attending college, living with my father he and his wife have very respectable income. I do not have to pay rent, I have an abundance of friends who care about me a lot, I have hobbies that I excel in, I am at least relatively proactive in taking care of myself eating breakfast, lunch dinner, exercise, etc., I dont partake in selfdestructive behaviors examples smoking, drinking, etc. So why do I feel sad? More importantly, why do I feel GUILTY for feeling sad? I look around and see people in situations light years worse than mine, and that is a big part of why I find it so hard to talk about this. I start to feel down and I want to speak up but my down is just the majority of the norm for some people, and I feel like I am unable to be taken seriously because of this. But even more than just worrying that other people will not take me seriously, I feel like I can not take myself seriously, and it feels beyond pathetic. I hate myself so much when I watch people in terrible situations still trying their best to do the best for themselves and others around them. I feel like I have such a golden opportunity at life yet Im just wasting it in self sorrow and self pity. This realization has pushed me to an extent. Like I said, I have hobbies that I excel in, I go running and try to take care of myself the best I can. I do my best to help around when I can, be a contributing member of communities and generally just be nice. Yet I still find myself feeling like its not enough and that Im just not worth it. How am I supposed to work on my problems when I dont even know what they are anymore? Im at a very low point in my life. I manage to put on a strongfront for my friends and family, and dont get me wrong, I am truly happy on a respectable amount of days.

I just want someone to vent all my frustration to and someone who can be there to talk to me when I need them but Im to scared to say anything about it because I dont want people to feel bad or worry about me.",
    "Please. Help me. Ive been feeling low all the time. Ill be graduating in June and I dont even have a job. Although Im trying to brushup my skills, but I lack confidence in everything. I find it really hard to brag or to lie about me. Everytime theres a new opening for a jobinternship i just dont apply thinking I lack skills, Im not good, they wont hire me, I wont perform well in the interview, my resume sucks etc etc. I used to be really chill amp confident. But now everythings gone. Every day I code to be good at it and find me an internship. Every night I cry thinking about all the wrong decisions that I made during college amp that all of my friends are ahead of me , chasing the perfect lifestyle with jobs in hand.

    "Fell in love with a married woman 2 years ago Fell deeply in love with a married woman two years ago and she came over to my place and her husband found out. I have been drinking everyday for 1.5 years after we had to break contact. I have also stalked her several times each day looking on facebook who she likes and who likes her. Have talked to her when I see her and how much I love her and how much feelings she has for me. I broke down this christmas after I quit watching pornography and realized she has found a new man behind his back and she is most likely trying to start a relationship with him. I ask her when I see her but I also push her further away. Today I told her I will leave her alone. All that I can think of is ending it. Any hope left?",
    "I'm truly stuck - can't quit, can't work. Can't get out of bed. Desperate for any advice. Im a grad student and Im suffering from depression. My progress has been slow in the last one year and my relationship with my PI is strained. Even before this pandemic, I was barely managing to do anything. Im in a different country and my visa depends on my PhD. It was my dream to do it. Even against my familys wishes, I secured funding and it was wonderful. I dont know what to do. Im really slipping. I cant seem to do anything with regard to work. But I cant seem to do anything else either. All the time I dont work, I spend feeling guilty about not working. I feel like a rat, which gets a shock if it goes right and gets a shock if it goes left at the end of a T . So its stuck. I am running out of time to finish this degree. Im making progress in therapy and even doing it several times a week. But its not helping me change my present. I wont get an opportunity like this again and see it slipping out of my hands. It makes me feel like an unreliable, irresponsible person. I dont want to be that person. I dont want to selfsabotage. I try my best everyday. I sit down to work. My therapist even said I was the most diligent patient hes met. Please point me to something. Anyone. Ill do anything.",
    "I'm so close to giving up Im so close to giving up on everything. For the last two weeks my mind has been in shit because someone I cared about betrayed me. They did something which could ruin my life and has given me severe trust issues for the foreseeable future. Because of this Ive started losing interest in every I used to enjoy. I used to love going to training but Im beginning to think whats the point. As well my mind is starting to become self destructive. So many times these last 2 weeks, I havent been able to look at myself in a mirror without saying something I hate about myself. Its brought me so close to the edge of hurting myself and Im beginning to lose it. I just want to have some I can trust and care about. But Im getting so paranoid that everyone I like and know just hates me. Its gotten to the stage where im talking to people I like, and Im over analyzing everything they say, thinking theyre just saying it out of pity for me. I just want someone, anyone to care about me. But I know no one ever will. Im starting to think that theres no point in existing since no one would miss me if Im gone. I feel Im just annoying everyone I talk to and Im just a burden on everyone.",
    "How to trust agian I 28f have been married to my husbands 38 for 10 years. We have 4 children together. My husband took a job out of town about 6 months ago. I woke up to a text one morning say he had said something side ways to someone wife and to ignore her husband is is going to make it dramatic. So I check my email and there it is! Her husband sent me screen shot of the conversation between them. He begged me to stay with him. I was and still am devastated. I dont know how to trust him. I dont know what to believe anymore.

    "I’m sick of everything, my life is just meant to be miserable. Its a long post, but I will appreciate any feedback from anyone who decides to read it! My struggle with depression started around 20172018. Im currently 18yo. Sometimes Im more stable than the other day, there are the times that Im capable of controlling how I response to big waves of emotions. But its never totally gone, it likes to come back and my behavior is often caused by some unhealed memories or habits from my lowest times. I get embarrassed when I get emotionally involved into a conversation, I hate the thought of making my mental health an excuse, but sometimes I just feel like I just ran a marathon, I lay down and I cant help but cry because of such a failure my life is and how weak I am. I have an abusive father, my family and I tried everything to solve problems and help him change but he wont listen to anyone. Our family is pretty much divided to responsible men my oldest brother and my father and women that should do everything around the house so everyone else, especially my father, can live comfortably. I have five siblings. Since Im the oldest girl Im expected to be the major housekeeper except my mom. Im also the one with the most sense of being fair and respectful towards what I have and whats given to me, thats why I rarely skip my responsibilities or deny any request or help. I feel overwhelmed about the amount of stuff I need to do, not to mention the way my parents treat me when something is not done perfectly. I graduated high school with average results, Im neither the smartest nor the dumbest person on earth. I dont have any specific abilities nor passions to pick a solid university major that would make me happy and open a career path that would let me sustain myself. Now that I can apply to college, my score is slightly beyond the minimum. I picked a major about Korea, the country and the language, its something I got interested in, I am studying Korean for a while. But when I realized how much points you have to have to get accepted I lost any excitement that I had, I barely meet the requirements, most people have tens of points more. I dont stand out in any way. I was never liked at school.",

I cant withstand the sexless loneliness, isolation, intimacy deprived existence I live. Im in school and I know what I want to do but its a very, very slim margin I make it. Im couch surfing and scrounging by. Nothing looks good right now.

    "I feel lost and disappointed in myself Im 23F I went to a 4year after high school, for 2 and a half years, struggled to find friends and did terribly in school but I stayed nonetheless??? I regret that so much because I spent most of my time sick because I had no one to take care of me. I continued going there for 2 and a half years? When J was almost miserable thinking it would get better.. i had a close friend there who eventually didnt want to be my friend anymore and I felt so alone away from my family. No one cared about me, why did I stay? Eventually I left of course, but why did I continue to go there for 2.5 years when I wasnt performing well and didnt fit in with people at all? Is this the same reason people stay in abusive relationships? Now, 23 years later, after working and going to community college, Im transferring this fall. I thought I would be able to get a second chance at college but this pandemic happens and my classes are online. I still feel so much abandonment after my friend left me in college. I felt like I put so much into them, and they left me. I feel like Im disappointing my family because they had high hopes for me, but I still havent proved myself to them. Im just so lost in my life.",

    "I don't know what to do at this point other than end it. Nothing has helped so far. I have CPTSD. I have nightmares, flashbacks, panic attacks, episodes of dissociation. I throw up or have an episode when people touch me in the wrong places, especially my stomach. The only reason I havent killed myself is because I have a beloved ferret named Slinky, and he wouldnt understand where I went if I died. He needs me. I dont want to live like this anymore, but I dont want to die. No treatment I have gone through has ever worked for me. I have been on 3 different SSRIs so far Prozac, Zoloft, Lexapro and none of them have put a dent in my mood. I have also been on Lamictal, a mood stabilizer. It didnt do anything, and they kept upping the dosage. I had to taper off of it because it was too much for my body to handle, and I would throw it up. I have been kicked out of several facilities for not responding to treatment in any way. Fortunately, I make a little bit of money. I sell art and I work at my grandfathers gas station down the road. TLDR Mom abused and neglected me to the point of not knowing how to function as a person, I have been sexually abused 3 times which resulted in an eating disorder, I am so mentally ill that I am in agony every day. I have untreated BPD, ADHD, CPTSD and possibly autism. I have severe anxiety and depression that no treatment can put a dent in. I have been kicked out of several facilities for being completely unresponsive to treatment. I am transgender FTM, preeverything, in an unsafe environment, and drowning in dysphoria. I live with so much misdirected guilt from everything that the only things I think about are hurting or killing myself. And I have to go to college this year. What the fuck do I do?",
    "SO says it's depression linked. How to stop being too much? Hello Lengthy post, so Im sorry in advance if I waste your time, I am diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, however I believe it doesnt affect my day to day life enough to claim anything because others have it worse and most likely would be a waste on me anyway. When Im a member of a team, I feel too insignificant in comparison to colleaguesteam mates to ever say or put in any input. I have explained to others that I see it as If I have to work really hard to keep the job, and they can chill  lounge around and still keep the job thats equal to mine, they must have more value than me, therefore I have to try harder and respect them as my superior. My managers and colleagues say Im too much and oldfriends have ended friendships due to me being too nice. At parties and gatherings, I decide to stay quiet because I believe Ill ruin the entire night and I find it easier to seek out those that arent enjoying themselves to then go over, give them a bit of social motivation, make myself a laughing stock for them to laugh with their new friends and allow them to enjoy the night from then on without me intefering and potentially making it worse. I have been told all my life I am too much, or just too something, but its more of an insult now, even if it is said with positive intention. I just want to be enough. Nothing more, nothing less. This has come around due to my mother saying I would have done so much better in my life if I didnt focus on helping others so much, but I didnt even realise I was focusing. She tells me Im too nice about once a month. After talking to my current SO, she says it is depression. Thank you for your time, and sorry for wasting time if you read this and dont know how to help, OQPATY",
    "I kill myself if you don’t read My upbringing only perpetuated my depression. My single mom never gave me responsibilities and I had too much free time. Making it worse I was a nerd so having the option to just stay inside and play video games was heaven. Years went by without speaking with anyone or trying to build relationships. In my teen years that was basically suicide because who wants to be known as the loner. So I would skip days to keep my fragile ego safe. Thoughts go by in my head that if I could just at the very least get over my fear for rejection I could get my life in order. Because having an intimate relationship would really solve a lot of current issues I have. And so Im actively looking subconsciously and consciously because i am starving for intimacy. I know how that would look desperate maybe a bit crazy. And its not about sex its about completely being open and honest with another person. I feel I can only be this intimate with a girl and refuse to open up to such an extent to the access of other human beings in my life. Because the human being in my life were not driven by choice ie family, childhood friends Im in a pickle and it sucks, but if it wasnt for weed I would not be aware of my issues, stayed positive and attempt to help myself. This is only a recent discovery ever since joe Rogan started talking about how weed paranoias actually help you figure out what is actually stressing you out. Thats the worst about depression, every action you do against yourself feels justified and logical. Its truly a terrible disease and I hope I survive this. Sorry about title Im just so desperate I apologize for my existence.",
    "How am I supposed to get help when no one will listen? Im in my late 20s and life has constantly taken a dump on me, I need to talk to a therapist, everything in life feels meaningless, nothing is fun anymore, and I cant take it. I came really close a few times in the spring to just ending it and realized I needed to get help. Talking with my friends didnt help, which is fair, theyre not professionals, but when I talked to my doctor he also kinda brushed off my concerns and gave me a referral to a therapist. I tried calling their offices multiple times but no one answered the phone or replied to the messages I left. Tried again with a different therapist but the same thing happened. I know my phone works and at this point I feel like the universe is just trying to tell me to kill myself, the only reason I havent is because I dont want to make my friends and family sad. What should I do here? I feel like trying again is just going to lead to failure and make feel worse, again. I wrote a few paragraphs about my situation but cut out all but the most relevant stuff, I can provide more info if needed, Im really just at a loss and dont know how much longer I can go on when everything seems to keep going wrong and I have so little to be proud of.",
    "I could use some help figuring out if there‘s a possibility I‘m suffering from depression This could turn out to be kinda long so I apologise in advance if anyone wants to read this. Long story short Im not sure if Im actually depressed or just imagining things. So, this took quite a lot for me to post this and I will try my best to describe my situation. Some general information Im 15M and have like a lot of germans been at home for homeschooling for almost a year know except for a few months where we went to school in person. To be honest I dont really know when things started but I was talking to a friend of mine videochat about a month ago and after he asked I explained to him how I was feeling. When I was done he said something along the lines of Hmm that kind of sounds like some depression you got there. Now to what I told him I think I stopped expressing how I feel at any given time at least a year ago and since covid took hold things have only gotten worse. I cant remember the last time I cried tbh i felt like crying pretty often lately or truly told anyone I wasnt doing too well. I always pretend Im happy and everything is normal so neither my parents nor my friends start worrying about me. One thing that really bothers me is that every time my friends who I 200 trust ask how Im doing I tell them fine. The conversation with my friend was an exception i guess. I want to explain it to them SO bad but somehow I keep stopping myself. A minor thing that might be worth mentioning is that I unfortunately remember practically every single mistake in my only relationship I ever had with a great girl I am not really over yet, friendships and in general ALL THE TIME. I always have to distract myself with something because every time Im left alone with my thoughts I go down the good old Why did I do that? Why would anyone do that? Whats wrong with me? Does heshe still remember that? road. School is almost insufferable because it leaves me a lot of time to think to myself and unfortunately its rarely happy thoughts. The thing that makes all this so hard to decipher for me is that Im never certain how I feel.",
    "I ( 26 female ) have decided to take care of my severely depressed younger brother (20m ) by letting him move in with me last week and need some tips. Hey all ! I am new to the group and a Canadian I would like some advice. This is a VERY long post so bare with me. I took on basically taking care of my severely depressed younger brother. I am 26 and my brother is 20. I have been moved out for 4 years, my brother has been under child protective services from the overly toxic environment at home. For some background mom is an addict  alcoholic  and dad definitely has mental illness and severe emotional disregulation and is severely controlling and overall unhealthy and manipulative  violent outbursts , tantrums, controlling .they are both functional for the most part but very terrible to be around and our entire family became severely dysfunctional as a result and has suffered a lot. In the past I have had reactive depression but am better now here is what I experienced  Basically I can get depressed when sad events happen like breakup death or I would experience severe anxiety when I lived with my parents  to say the least  . I got depressed and severely melancholic  experience debiliating guilt ans selfhatred  and could not function well for months years after certain events happened so I relate to my brother and understand him very well. However, the difference between my brother and I is that I sought help and still speak to someone every 2 weeks.. My brother was always forced into help by CPS for example. He also is a highschool dropout 2x because of the home environment and I know that the social stigma that comes with this has really weighed down on his selfesteem. He is very smart  beat a Canadian chess champion at chess  but he never takes compliments and feels like his depression has altered his ability to retain information  poor memory, brain fog  . He is VERY hard on himself and I almost feel like he would rather stay depressed as a way to selfpunish himself for dropping out of highschool  he even told me he feels like he does not deserve anything good because he is in his own words a  loser .. and feels like he is tired of being alive. Not exactly suicidal in that he does not intent to kill himself but he is fed up of living so could very well do something dangerous if this continues .",
    "Being suicidal and scared to die So for as long as I can remember I have been depressed, I dont mean that in the oh yeah Ive been sad for a while I mean I was first formally diagnosed with clinical depression at age 6 in 1997. I like to joke that its my longest lasting relationship. So what brings me to write this post? Ive been in a horrendous depressive episode for the last 18 months over my live Ive been depressed all but 6 years, but it comes and goes in waves steadily its been getting worse and worse, becoming suicidal, secluding myself, and all the other lovely things that go with it. I want to die, I dont want to be here anymore, and before you suggest medication, Ive been on every medication for depression also multiple for anxiety and a couple antipsychotic meds too. Counselling has never worked for me, I stopped doing illicit drugs years ago stopped smoking, stopped drinking, tried exercise and diets. Yet, I still have suicidal thoughts and feelings everyday, all day, and night. I wake up sad that I have woken up. I go to sleep hoping that I have stroke or heart attack that kills me in my sleep. Ive planned my suicide so many times and in so many different ways, I have attempted suicide a few times in the past. Now to the crux of my problem, I want to die, but Im scared of actually being dead. Any thoughts or suggestions will be welcome. Thanks.",
    "Please help, my girlfriend is depressed, I have no idea what to do. I tell her Ive been somewhat feeling the same and that Im here for her and I love her. I try to keep talking to her and I ask her to talk to me, but she kept getting more and more quieter, hesitant, then she starts apologizing, saying shes sorry for being a burden on me, saying that shes going to hurt me, saying theres nothing I can do to help her, and Im trying my best, I told her I love her so many times, I told her that Im here for her and I dont care if shes at her best or her worst, I told her that the next time I see her Im going to hold her tightly in my arms and then give her a passionate kiss, that Im going to buy her something nice and make her feel special, that Im going to live her no matter what state shes in, but she was still being really quiet and eventually just left me on read so I left her along. I kept trying to get her to talk to me, I wasnt trying to make her day something she didnt want to tell me, I just wanted to know that she was going to be ok before I fell asleep. Idk Im scared, a few weeks ago we were in a call, and she starts talking and venting to me about all the shit going on in her life, she starts crying really hard, then she admitted to breaking a mirror and cutting herself with it and that just fucking broke my heart. What do I do. I have no idea. I love this woman with every fiber of my being. I care for her and her wellbeing. When I see her like this, its like my heart loses a piece of its soul, if that even makes sense. Please, help. Is there anything I could possibly do. Edit ok, before I posted this, I got insanely depressed. I wanted to get high and numb myself like I usually do when I feel like this, but I only have a little bit of thc oil in my cart left and I was saving it for fun times with friends and with her, and I didnt want to waste it so instead of doing that, I decided to write a song.",
    "Staying POSITIVE is ALREADY hard and now I am the caregiver to a SUICIDAL FRIEND Hi guys, I dont know if this is the right forum for my overall mixed content. Im 23 F. And I need some advice on my situation. Appreciate it if yall could share with me your thoughts. To start off, I have both anxiety and depression. I know that with those 2, it definitely would be a roller coaster ride with my emotions and I am familiar with this as it is like a cycle that I kept having to go through. I would say that my depression is not as severe as my anxiety though. So back to my main story. Recently I have been busy trying to help a suicidal friend. I have known her for 7 years plus and am aware that she was suffering from depression. I always thought that it was going to be okay as time goes by but then I realized it worsened. She was really going all out on ending her life that I had to call the police on her. Thing is, she has been planning out her will and settling whatever she considered as necessity for the preparation of her demise. Its like i am scared but I have no choice to take charge as she does not have a good rs with her family. I managed to persuade her to go and seek help from the professional. She was adamant but somehow agreed eventually. First medication didnt work so we changed to another type. End up, she decided to stop taking the medication all by herself. She went MIA for about a week or so. When she finally texted, it was bad news  she was prepping to end her life. I had to call the police on her. Apparently she lied to them that she was okay and would be attending her appointment, so they couldnt do anything in my country the police can only intervene if you are caught in the act of committing suicide. However later on she berated me as she felt that I had betrayed her. She however continued to confide in me. I was pretty much unsure what to do so I wrote a letter to the family secretly I know where she stays and i made sure to text her mum that I had put a letter outside their house gate.",

Him being in a low place drains me a lot, but Im constantly scared of him doing something to harm himself. In these past few days he has constantly been expressing how tired he is of living, how he doesnt think he can do it live anymore, and how he wish he was never born. I can feel that hes always trying to push me away so that he wont hurt me anymore, but then he says that Im the only person and thing that he cares about.

    "My mother and I had an unsettling conversation in the midst of my depression, and I don't know how to feel... Okay, so I am teen 14M who is dealing with a lot of struggles. I have had depression for months, and I dont know what to do. I live in a smal part of a big town, which means I dont see many friends often, and Im the only one my age in that part of town. Thats bad from a start, but thats not whats triggering me... I had been dealing with my dumbass psycho ex, not able to see my gf, being bullied and cyberbullied. I have beaten myself until I bled, every day in the past 2 weeks, and I always wonder if life is worth living, and yet I still try to piece things together again. Yesterday, I had figured out that my past was a lot worse than I had originally thought, with reoccurring memories of childhood trauma. We were having a normal conversation about how I was doing at school as usual, but it took a turn quickly back to the worst childhood memories I had, which all I had forgotten until then. I had thought it was always peaceful back then since almost every childhood memory I had before then was happy. I even bring up these positive memories whenever Im down. And these memories came back. Heres what they were one by one in the order they happened The first memory, the only one I couldnt regain my perception on was one from when I was in preschool obviously. The last day I went to preschool, my mother was watching in the preschool because she noticed things werent perfectly fine there. Before it was over, a little girl who was 3 years of age, opened one of the metal doors and accidentally slammed her fingers in the doors. The tips of 3 of that girls fingers were cut off from that door and was bleeding everywhere. The staff was panicking, but they werent doing anything. They didnt call for help. They just stood and watched. The staff, also, were both 17 yearolds watching over 32 preschool kids which was illegal. My mother quickly took me out of that daycare and felt so bad for leaving me there.",

    "is this a normal for parents to do? When i was like 1112 years old someone had done a poo in the toilet and left it and my Mum found it and both my brother and I said that we didnt do it. So my Mum made us both bend over in front of Dad and her and wiped our bums for us and then showed everyone the piece of toilet paper and whether it had shit on it or not. I remember her telling us to bend over more because she said she couldnt reach. My subconscious and conscious is telling me im a horrible person for saying this about my parents and that im just imagining it. But i know im not. Its killing me not being able to remember things from this event and from when my Mum left. The next parts foggy but i know that the first part above is definitely accurate I think my Mum wiped my bum and got shit on the paper and blamed it on me or something idk. And then i think my brother had shit on his paper as well. I think we were both ridiculed. I have many traumas involving my parents since then. Im now 18. And ive been in an emotionally incestuous relationship with my Father. My brother beats me. And my Mum doesnt do anything because she feels powerless because shes now a single mother my parents are separated I also reported my brother to the police last year for touching my boobs and beating me with a belt which my mum saw. But nothing happened and i dont think the police believed me because i was overweight. Anyway, whats everyone opinion on the poo wiping situation. Is that normal for parents to do?",
    "Today I reached my rock bottom I flunked the bar twice and what is more painful is that ALL my friends passed. I am happy for them but there is a part in me which thinks I am inadequate for not being able to pass it. Everyone I know, even those who do not do well in law school made it. No comforting words can console me. Every time I take a nap I really I would die. I am even having this evil thought I get corona virus or something. My sister shouted fake news when she thought I passed. I saw their excitement. My parents ran towards me. But when I said I actually failed again they just turned their back and left. No comfort whatsoever. So now I am all alone. Images of my ex when we were breaking up during my bar review was recurring and his words which go like I have nothing to be proud of. I just proved him right. My friends are all cheering up on me but everything is just cliche. And what do I expect? They cannot mourn with me bec they are all celebrating. I am currently employed in a law firm that I love but if I have to take the bar again, I need to resign to pave way for my review. I also dont want to stay because the work would get me reminded that I am not a lawyer. It is heartbreaking to leave a firm I finally love. Then bar in our country is moved to 2021 due to corona virus. I am going to derail my life for 2 years. I am more than delayed. I feel so left out. I see no purpose in life. I am starting to give up on my dream of being an attorney. I want my life to end. I think Ive seen enough. This life keeps on knocking me down as I am that strong. I used to be but I reached my end.",

He even made me feel like I belong. But ever since Ive met him Ive been so much happier. I dont think about hurting myself anymore. The dark thoughts are almost nonexistent.

I have been severely depressed sense I was 13, with few ups on the summers, I see people in my school, falling in love, getting in trouble, crying after a test, experiencing with drugs a little which Im no longer allowed to they drive down town and have friends, I know its probably not as perfect as I see it, but its still something. I seem to get away from everyone, and after some manic episodes some of them find me pretty weird. Im very sad that Im supposed to be having not only a good time, but a great time, instead Im miserable, jealous, and apparently somewhat suicidal.

I dont expect anyone to solve this to me, their is nothing to solve, just keep going to therapy and take my pills that seem to get more intense with time instead of less Im just asking for some recognition of the pain, and maybe some people to tell me how it gets better, its kind of stupid, but it helps a little, thinking it might ever end and Im not messing my best years",

    "The Effects of Depression on a Relationship [ADVICE] I am in relationship with someone who has major depression. When it gets really bad for him, it gets bad for us. He can be a little mean, irritable. These times feel the loneliest for me. I cant help but feel sad as a consequence at times. I understand that in these moments he isnt himself nonetheless it still hurts. I am generally busy and there is distance between us. I feel guilty at times I cant do more and feel like I am being pulled everywhere in my life in general. I feel numb and sadness which I try like hell to ignore in myself to preclude any ideas of seeing a breakup as a resolution to how I am feeling. I do love him, his pain is my pain. There is a certain emotional fortification developed when you are in these types of relationships perhaps that is why I feel like I am not allowed to crumble, need or want especially when it gets really bad. Is there any better way to deal with this? with us? my loneliness? How can you be happy in life when your partner isnt? How do you share a life when your partner doesnt have the energy at times to pick the phone or talk to you?",
    "Help with depression Hello everyone, This is my first time on reddit and my first time posting. I am sure many people face issues that are much worse than mine, but I dont know what to do anymore other than ask for help. English is not my first language so I apologise for any mistakes. For context I am 24 yo, female, with a stable job and a loving boyfriend. By all means I should be happy right? Well I started feeling more and more depressed a few months ago and so far, it hasnt changed. I dont feel like eating and have lost weight, I dont feel like going out or hanging out with people and I could literally spend my whole day sleeping which I did for the past two days, missing work, I often find myself crying for no reason and I dont enjoy anything anymore. My boyfriend is abroad for a while because of his studies, and so I am able to hide from him most of the time. But its getting harder and harder and I think he is starting to lose patience. Our last two conversations was him telling me that he is sick of me moaning every two days and crying for no reason. This is not the first time I have been depressed, and usually it follows something bad, but this time I feel like its all in my head and its Something that I cant get out of. Its starting to impact my job, my Relationship and everything else in my life... Do any of you have any advice for me? ampx200B Thank you for taking the time to read this post!",
    "Am I a wuss? So Ive been living with my roommatefriend for like half a year. I think Im a decent enough roommate I clean up after myself, help out, blah blah blah. Anyway I was making dinner for us. She chopped up the pasta sauce ingredients and I made the sauce and pasta. So basically I used too much pasta for the amount of sauce I had. Honest mistake I think tell me if Im wrong please!. She got frustrated and lashes out. Essentially calling into question me as a man and as a cook. bottom line was I got hurt and ended up crying. Now this worries me for a few reasons. The last time I was too sensitive about being insulted was around the time I had a breakdown. Basically it felt like my emotions were sunburned and any little negative comment pushed me over. Also those kinds of things attacking my manhood and pretty much anything negative about me has been a sort of depression mantra when Im upset lots of negative thoughts rolling out at once. My question is this is it possible Im too easily triggered? Or maybe the particular subject matter was a significant trigger? Or maybe am I just a wuss and therefore not much of a man?",
    "I’m feeling very low energy and demotivated after about a month with Lexapro, spending most of the time in bed. I need help. I started taking Lexapro 5 weeks ago at 5mgday for situational or reactionary depression which isnt a major clinical depression according to my doctor. I had the initial side effects as predicted like sleepiness and vivid dreams, etc. which resolved in a couple of weeks as well as all the negative feelings and dark moods of loneliness etc. plus the anxiety and feeling overwhelmed which have mostly gone, however Ive been feeling extremely unmotivated and low that Im barely making it to work and the rest of the time Im in bed. My sleep was also quite bad feeling unrested in the mornings. Normally I drink one coffee and one tea a day but recently Ive been taking triple shot espressos and Im not feeling any difference. My sugar and carb consumption has also increased. Last Monday when I had my follow up with the doctor he decided to increase the dose to 10mgday. Ive been on 10mgday for almost a week now and probably my sleep quality has improved a little bit but still very very unmotivated and low. Im going through upsetting phases with my family which doesnt help and while I had managed to keep my life under control for a while, things have got out of hand again and my room is a total mess. Ive been pushing myself to get things done but Im making no progress. Theres barely any space in the room to walk. My next follow up is on Friday but I dont want to stay miserable till then.

    "College student wondering if checking myself in to a hospital would be the best option— any advice? What was it like/how much did it cost financially? Hi everyone, hoping I can get some advice on what to do in the next couple days. Ive been seriously thinking of killing myself for about fourfive months definitely had suicidal thoughts before that for many many years, but I didnt start thinking it though or planning anything out until now. Im starting to finally feel like Im reaching the end, lol. I genuinely believe that I do not have the capacity to harm myself in any way, significantly or even slightly. So I kind of feel like Id be lying when I tell them I have intent thats more than just thoughts, although I do have many plans Im hoping I can go through with when Ive finally reached my limit so Im afraid they wont admit me anyways. Im trying to weigh the proscons of trying to get myself admitted and so far Ive only been able to come up with cons My worriesconcerns  I have no idea how much a stay or checking myself in would cost. I believe that this worrying would leave me off a lot worse than I am now. Id also be worrying about what my friendsfamily are thinking while Im gone and how Im just causing them unnecessary stress itd be a shock for them as they dont know any of this  Id also be worrying about missing my classesassignmentsa midterm and how I would catch up afterward  I feel like Id be generally miserable for however long Im there  I think it might make me miserable enough to actually commit suicide after I leave, although I feel like I wouldnt be able to effectively kill myself and then would have to go through the whole process of hospitalization over again. I just dont see that many pros in checking myself in, but I dont really know what else to do. Could anyone whos gone through the process give some guidance? Thank you.",

    "Meds help - Sertraline Please help lol. TLDR at the bottom. I started taking Citalopram 5 years ago and tried to ween myself off them. When I did that, after I stopped taking them any little thing would make me angry or burst into tears. I was surprised at how much the meds actually effected me. So I asked doctor if I can change my meds entirely and went onto Sertraline, 50mg. I recently decided I dont want to be on these meds forever, and asked my Dr how do I stop them? He was no help whatsoever and said just half them etc and take it ever other day etc. I did that and now Im off them. But Ive noticed my moods changed. Any little thing that doesnt go right, I get really angry and I could burst into tears. Seriously all the time. Has anyone come off these and experienced what Im going through? Does it stop? Do you start to feel normal again? TLDR  Weened myself off Sertraline, little things that go wrong make me angry and cry. Does this stop? Will I feel normal again? When?",

That being said I still havent figured out what I want to do with my life and feel like I have been living on autopilot for most of the recent years. I feel like I have been going through some form of depression since I was a teenager, nothing major but I certainly feel a lack of motivation, a dissatisfaction with myself, apathy, cynicism and anxiety. Whenever I try to think about what I want to do with my life I just get a blank. Whenever I feel sad and try to think what would make me happy I also get a blank Lately I have been so dissatisfied with everything that I started asking myself, what world would I want to live in? where would I be happy?

    "The Story of This Year The male room mate out of the 2 that were sleeping together ended up finding another girl he liked and he spent a lot of time with her which left me and the girl to get very close. Now all these people I consider my close friends, but the girl and I became really close and spent a lot of time together. We were just friends, and thats the way I liked it. We would spend every night chatting and laughing and having a grand old time while my other roommate was off with the girl he liked. The girl he liked who studies nursing ended up leaving for placement. She had to move away for 6 weeks to study so he spent more time with us at the flat. I started getting more and more depressed, just little things getting to me and stuff playing on my mind. One of my biggest stresses were bills and money. Our first electricity bill was close to 700 and that was for one month. I was so stressed about the next one that it made me really depressed. About 5 months after the first bill, our second one was due. About a month before I knew we would receive it I tried my hardest to start looking for ways I could pay it in case it was as high as the first. I desperately were looking for jobs, I started thinking about selling my stuff and I couldnt think of anything. So I came to the conclusion that I might not be able to pay it, and that if I could, when the next bill came out I would have to do this all over again. So I decided it might be best for me to move back to college. I ended up telling my room mates and they werent happy about it, we got into a fight and upset me so much. I was so stressed and sad that I thought I couldnt take it anymore. So I went to my medicine draw and grabbed every pill I could find and took them. It ended up being about 70 different pills in total. After doing it I freaked out and called my house mates, they both had left to go to a party. The girl came home and rushed me to hospital while the other one stayed at the party to get drunk.",

I switched to Wellbutrin and didnt even have any side effects, I felt like I was taking a sugar pill in the morning because it also didnt help at all. I start Effexor tomorrow and am setting up counseling, but Im literally ruining my life right now. In past semesters, I was able to scrape through with a B average and go to most of my classes. Thats not the case anymore. Im not getting out of bed until the sun goes down, Im skipping days of classes at a time, I have no idea what any of my grades are  and the worst part is that I cant even bring myself to care. Somewhere in the back of my mind I KNOW that if I fail this semester Im going to majorly fuck up my financial aid and wont graduate on time, but it just doesnt matter to me. Im too tired to care. I barely wake up in time for work most days, and Im having to make excuses for being late all the time. I dont cook, so I dont eat. I dont clean, so my room and kitchen are disgusting.

    "Nothing, and I mean NOTHING helps Do you know whats worse than being depressed and not having your life in order? Being depressed and having your life in order, because if your life is already in order, there is nothing you can improve on and nothing you can do to try and get better meaning there is no hope. My life used to be a mess, but at least I had something to fall back onto. When I told people about my depression, they told me about all the things that helped them out like exercising, extracurricular activities, going out with friends, having good grades, eating well, etc. As someone that couldnt even get out of bed to take a shit, I listened to what everyone told me and did it all. I became an A studentathlete, Im not too good socially but I have a few friends that I talk to and occasionally hang out with, and I lost a lot of weight, but the entire time, I couldnt shake this feeling that everything was off. Theoretically, I should be happy right now, I have become something that I thought was impossible 2 years ago, but it has become clear by now that no matter what I do, I will still want to kill myself. I mean, I feel the same, if not worse than I did 2 years ago. I still stare at my dads pistol every time I walk past it in its case, I still think about cutting myself every time I see a blade. One single thing Ive noticed that has been with me since I was like 7, is that the thought of death is the only thing that brings me comfort in tough times. At this point, I feel like it wont be too long until that thought finally becomes reality.",
    "I'm tired of my lack of motivation Hi, first post here, so Idk if the flair is right and if I will be able to put in words my feelings. Anyways, Ill give it a try, so sorry for the long post. Since the beggining of the quarantine I came to live with my boyfriend bc I know if I didnt see him often I would lose my mind and terrible things might happen. My college is trying to transform our courses in online courses, and is mainly succeeding. In the beggining I sort out everything I should do, to not leave everything to the last minute, so in the first weeks I worked like crazy and managed to anticipate the majority of my tasks. This leads me to last week. Last week I confirmed through my professors and schedules that I was ahead of almost everything. I read most of the texts, wrote most essays, made almost everything that I could do. I had almost no day to just relax or do only minor chores. So when I took my bullet journal to schedule last week and this current one, I saw that if I did one task per day I would be free to read my book and be concerned with other things, since college stuff would be done. So I distributed one task for each day untill the end of this week. But I CANT DO THEM! It is driving me crazy because it is only one simple task I must do that day, but I cant find ANY motivation to do them and now theyre accumulating! Im getting mad at myself because its just one stupid task! And I cant do it! And this lack of motivation is affecting other things. I cant wake up early to do my exercises anymore, I cant be happy doing lunch I loved to cook, but now its just an obligation, even my games and my books dont make me happy anymore! Im in a constant state of apathy and I hate this! And now Im concerned that because of this my boyfriend will think that Im just not happy around him bc of him, and thats not the problem at all. Sorry for the long post and thank you in advance for hearing me. I would really appreciate some support words.",
    "My breakup is killing me Sorry about the melodramatic title, but this really is what it feels like. Ill try to keep this story short, however I could keep on talking for hours and if someone one this sub was willing to have a talk with me by PMs Id love to because Im just so incredibly lonely right now. About a week ago my girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me. It was a stupid breakup and I feel like my behaviour is the reason for why we broke up, even though she too made plenty of mistakes. When I lost her I once again realized how much she meant to me and that I didnt want to lose her at any costs so I tried to get her back. But all I got were meanspirited messages saying how she doesnt miss me, shes realized were incompatible and that shes glad I moved out. Some days ago I created a tinder profile because I thought itd help me get over her. Guess what, first evening on tinder I saw her profile. And it fucking killed me inside. The next days, she would routinely put some nice clothes on and leave, while I was stuck in the living room watching her leave to some tinder gate, and it killed me. Thats when I realized I had to leave.. so while she was at work I packed up all my stuff and left, leaving her one last voice message that I cant take the situation and that I still want her back. Thats when I got her meanspirited message. I feel like she was all I had. People I talk to are telling me to distract myself with things that are fun to me, but frankly, I dont know whats fun to me anymore. Watching tv shows? Gaming? Playing the guitar? I feel like watching shows and gaming are just occupational therapy to me. I used to love playing the guitar, at least I think so, but nowadays I feel so fucking bad whenever I play that its hard to call it fun either. Sports? Ive gained some weight so I decided I wanted to lose 10kg. That was a week ago, the same day she broke up with me in fact, its kind of the reason why we got into the fight responsible for our breakup.",

They let me ranttalk to them about things I deal with and how I feel, but I feel as if Im making them feel bad also and becoming more of a burden than a friend. I feel as if Ive ruined what couldve ruined any future with 2 different people because of it.

I want to be better and be happy and normall, but I dont know how and my parents beliefs mostly their church restrict me from doing so. I feel as if Im stuck and in a constant loop of finally being happy, something happening or realize what Im wanting to so is against what they believe, my anxiety getting bad, and then depressed. I have a close friend that tries to help me, but I feel as if he doesnt think Im trying to get better. He understands the situation Im in, but I still cant help but think that. I also got diagnosed with endometriosis which then restricts a lot of physical things I can do, which makes things worse mentally for me. Ive been asked by another friend if I have a hobby or something to keep me distracted, but I dont. I never did much activity growing up due to religious beliefs like sports or anything else.

    "Is it okay to drop a class for the sake of my own health? So I am currently in college. I am in my second semester as a freshman first year and I am an undecided major. I was leaning towards computer science or graphic design, but this CS170 class is stressing me out. The class by itself doesnt sound too bad. But thinking about the homework, which the professor warned could take up to 6 hours outside of class to complete, is what stresses me out. When I think about my other classes like Religious Studies, World History, Geology, and Design, I dont think I can handle the work load of CS170 PLUS the workload of the other classes.

Ive withdrawn myself from almost everyone. I have no desire to go out and make friends or have fun. Not that I care to have a social life I just figured Id throw it in there for context. I cant forgive myself for a lot of the things Ive done. I dont know how to. Ive spent so long punishing myself I dont know how to forgive myself. I want to get better. I want to be happy and have a stable relationship with my son again. I just dont even know where to start. Ive tried talking to a therapist before but I didnt really like talking to someone I dont know about my life. I dont like talking to anyone about my feelings. I dont know what else to say. Just started speaking from my mind for a minute. I dont do it often and what better place than here. P. S. Im atheist so I dont think religion is going to help me with this. If you made it to the end I appreciate your time. I hope you have a wonderful dayevening.",
    "Does anyone else feel like a bother when opening up about their mental health? Ive been getting to know this guy lately, and hes very sweet and wonderful. I have slowly started opening up to him about my anxiety and mental issues I have. I noticed after doing so, I hear a bit of a Youre telling him too much. He doesnt care.

    "I don’t know anymore 22 F Ive been really bad depressed for a really long time. Anxious, suicidal. A lot of abuse and mental illness here. I had a lot of shit happen a month ago and Im struggling to deal with it now. I went numb until recently because it was just too much. I almost killed myself on a Monday. Wednesday I found out my friend did kill himself. Sunday was the funeral. Monday I was raped by someone I thought was my friend. Tuesday my boyfriend kept making suicide jokes. Wednesday I broke up with him. I cried over my friends passing. It hurts, I still get sad sometimes, but its out of my system for the most part. What isnt out of my system is the rape. I didnt realize it had happened until about a week ago. Like I knew factually we had sex and I felt like I cheated but I couldnt really remember it. Then a week ago I told a friend what happened and hes actually the one that pointed out uhhh thats rape. And I was like oh...yeah.... I guess so. Anyways I went numb after that but tonight thats broken. Ive cried so much for so long but I still just keep starting back up. I need to sleep because I have work tomorrow but Im struggling with sleeping alone. The tv isnt helping. Im always exhausted after crying but I just cant sleep. S",
    "I might have depression... How do I go about getting help? My parents are very old school, they dont believe in mental health at all and if I go to a psychologist Ill have to go in secret. Im not even sure if our insurance covers mental health visits. If it doesnt I cant afford it, I have no money of my own. According to my parents this sadness is punishment for my past sins, if I didnt do so many bad things I wouldnt be feeling this way now. 3 years ago I begged my parents to take me to a psychologist and my parents were shocked and said our daughter is not crazy and shut down the topic as quickly as they could. Like end of discussion. This lead to my attempted suicide and even that they covered up, said to the emergency doctors that what happened just happened by accident. And that was that",
    "I don’t feel comfortable being sad around my partner Ive been diagnosed with MDD just about a year ago. Ive had ups and downs and just really low points. The only person I feel is really there for me is my mom, and even she doesnt seem to want to try and understand my depression. My girlfriend tries to be there for me, but shes expressed to me that my crying and sad behaviors make her uncomfortable and upset. I can understand how she feels about it, but its gotten to the point where she just ignores me when Im sad. I dont even feel like I can cry to her and tell her how Im feeling without ending up just leaving the room because Im afraid Ill make her uncomfortable or that shes get upset at me for just being sad. Is this a bad sign? Should I ask her about this more? Is it wrong for me to feel upset about this?",
    "We were engaged. He left me for a 19 year old he has been talking to online for the past 3 months Now that he had found this other girl, he felt he really connected with someone. I was stabbed in the back multiple times by the person that always said that I was his soulmate and by a girl that came into my life pretending to be my friend, and I actually believed that. This same day he unblocked her in all social medias and changed his profile picture everywhere it was a picture of us. So yeah, my world just fell apart in a matter of days. He became what he criticized the most and I became what I feared the most. Im already a skinny person and I lost around 4kg in a week. I never had trouble sleeping, now I simply cant have at least a decent night of sleep. I wake up in the middle of the night many times with my heart racing, I have multiple nightmares about the situation. I even had a few panic attacks. I dont have energy to do anything. Im on my last semester of college and I cant do anything. I cant eat, Ive thrown up multiple times and just seeing food makes me nauseous. I honestly rather be dead than have all these feelings. Less than a month ago I was the happiest person ever, I had something to look forward to, I had someone in my life that I thought that loved me. Turned out it was just a huge lie. No matter how much I write about this, how much detail I put into everything, I wont be able to describe my sadness and emptiness. I would wish no one this feeling, not even them.",
    "How can I (32F) stop feeling like such a burden to my husband (36M)? I am going through a very difficult time after two miscarriages in the past couple of months and a recurrence of depression and anxiety symptoms. He works about an hour away, while I work from home, although I have very little work, so most of my days are just spent doing...well, nothing. Im sometimes so depressed I cant keep up with basic chores, which I feel I should be doing since Im home all day. My husband hasnt confronted me about it directly but I think it annoys him. ampx200B Some days I feel okay. Other days I am irrational, fearful and tearful. I have a huge fear that he will leave me, which I have expressed to himand which he always denies, but I know it must get annoying that I keep bringing it up, though I cant seem to help myself. I cant imagine how annoying and difficult it must be for him to come home from work and not know if hes coming home to see me on an okay day or a really bad day. ampx200B Our communication isnt bad, but Ive recently felt myself pulling away and trying to rely on my own inner strength, but sometimes that backfires and I do a 180 and turn into an absolute mess with him. ampx200B I feel like he deserves so much better than having basically a halfwife who is so unsteady. Does anyone have any tipsmantrasetc. for making me feel just...better about how much of a burden I am placing on him? I am talking to a therapist once a week and on medication, but I am still really struggling with these feelings of feeling unworthy and pathetic.",
    "Suicide bereavement making existing depression intolerable Obvious TW for suicide My depression is worse than ever since my little sister died by suicide last year. Like beyond normal grief, it worried my suicide bereavement counselor type stuff. I cant post on the suicide bereavement sub because my grief makes me suicidal and I dont want to trigger anyone over there. When I posted on suicidewatch everyone ignored me and I got embarrassed and took the post down after like 6 hours. I just feel so depressed and dont want to be here right now. Im doing my best to stick around for my family but its hard. Im not excited about my career, my relationship, my prospects for ever living a good life. I just want to sleep until my next therapy appointment on Monday and then sleep until the one after that and soforth. I dont believe my life is ever going to get better and Im just so done. Last time I tried the hotline I couldnt get through to anyone and I wasnt an active threat so Id probably get triaged out anyways. What do I do? Im supposed to be petsitting starting today but Im having a hard time leaving my bed to go be in someone elses house. Im scared that without all my comfort stuff Ill be even worse off Please help me figure out how to get through to Monday?",
    "How do I process a break up with depression and anxiety I cannot sleep well even though Im on medication, I get panic attacks, have anxiety all the time about him replying back to me, being alone again, rejection and where my life is heading especially with this virus because I was suppose to move in with him. Everything else was fine with the relationship except for the apps and communication. How do cope with this?",
    "Depressed Partner (quarantine) Hi! F29 M29 My partner of 2 years asked me for space on Thursday after his therapist appointment. He said he didnt want to make any rushed decision breakup until he had a more clear view of things. We had just moved in together in January and now he isnt sure if he was ready. He has been struggling with being stuck at home, no sports on tv, and me nagging him to get out of the house with me for walks or just even eating in our patio. I had no background or knew how to deal with depression so I cried and made him feel responsible for what he was feeling. He said he was confused and didnt know if the quarantine or our relationship where the real cause of his depression. I left but didnt even hug him. I made some research and felt so gulty of not being compassionate to him and went back on Friday to beg him to trust me. He said he still needed time but that everything I had said helped him. I stayed away but reading everything I could, joined TalkSpace which has helped me a lot and felt very connected with people going through the same thing. I slowly realized his illness made him so unworthy of love that he felt that me being out of his life would help him. I kept on sending text of encourganmet once a day and have food, essentials deliveries to the house the quarantine does not help. Today I came over in the morning and let our dog out and fed her. He was still in bed, I came in the room hugged him and reassured I would always be here. He had a drainedsad look on his face but hugged me back. I said I LOVE YOU and he could bearly get the words out. I then left..... I just need some help knowing things will pass. Ive done evrything I can and all left its to wait. Its just seems impossible when all I really want to do is hug him every morning.",
    "Feeling Lost and Weak Hi there, um, I dont really know how else to start this, so Im just gonna go, okay? okay. Ive struggled with severe anxiety and depression for basically my whole life. Or maybe not my whole life, its hard to remember, but definitely after my mother died. Car accident. Nasty business. I was 12, I saw it happen. I think Ive been broken ever since then. It got worse and worse and worse over the course of a decade. I went from honors student, gifted, to dropping out of college. My brain felt like it was clogged up with glue. But I told myself it was all my own fault, that I was just lazy, selfish, immature. Making excuses. Ive seen some doctors, therapists too, most of them were incredibly unhelpful. The stress of dealing with the medical system outweighed any help I got from them. Any medications they tried to make me feel better were duds at best. I went through a really, REALLY bad period about 34 years ago. I lost my entire group of friends, and let myself be abused by my partner for far longer than I should. I turned to selfharm, it was the lowest point Id been in my life. I still see the scars when I look in the mirror. But then I started to get better! I got new friends, got a job, allowed myself to be proud for once. I stopped self harming, swore never to again. Even after getting sexually harassed by my thankfully ex boss, even after losing my grandfather to cancer, I kept it together...for about a year and a half. Almost exactly one year ago I got hit by a car as I was crossing the street. Physically I was mostly unharmed, but it brought back all those memories from the accident where I lost my mother. I started becoming irritable, lethargic, occasionally manic, and the panic attacks...at one point I was having full panic attacks ever single day. I knew I needed help, but I felt powerless to get it. I had to leave my old clinic because the stopped taking my insurance.",
    "Please help, I'm so alone I am so alone. Not just lonely, completely alone. Theres not one person I can turn to for help. I dont know what I did to deserve this suffering. I dont understand what makes me so repulsive that not one single person wants to be in my life, despite trying my absolute hardest. I dont understand what I can do to have a normal life and nobody will help. Everyone says I just have to wait and be patient and people will come, but they havent, and life doesnt wait for anybody. All this time keeps ticking and going down the drain and Ive missed out on so much. I am 25 now and still havent even learned how to be a teenager or had any teenage friends or teenage life experiences yet, but now Im too old to even have those experiences and have completely missed out on everything. I cant even get therapy because they said I have to have at least 1 hour a week of social interaction for 6 months before they will even consider a rereferral, which is a completely impossible goal. I spend like 1216 hours a day, begging and begging for people to be in my life, even offering them money, but literally not one person will hang out with me, even once. They all assume somebody else will but nobody does. I dont know what to do. Im so lost and theres not one person I can ask for help. No family members, no friends, no idea how to get them in the first place. Youve got to have people to get people and Im just stuck in this cycle of isolation. Speaking to people on the internet is like speaking to bots who all copy and paste the same useless things, put yourself out there join a group etc etc, Ive already done it for years and years and years and and none of it has worked. I dont know what to do.",
    "Seeing the doc tomorrow about starting medication! Hey guys, so this post is me mainly looking for some words of encouragement. Ive rescheduled this appointment like 3 times because Ive been so nervous about it, but tomorrow is the day I just suck it up and go in to talk to a doctor about the option of starting depression meds. Im excited to take this step for myself, but I guess Im just nervous about talking to someone outside of my therapist about my depression. Im worried Ill be judged or they wont believe me. Id like to believe the inherent good in everyone but this just makes me feel really vulnerable. Id really appreciate any support or encouragement!",
    "Don't understand my depression 28 year old male here. Im having a bit of trouble expressing what my depression really is. To my therapist, my psychiatrist, my longterm boyfriend, hell even to myself. I dont want to kill myself, I dont want to die, I just want to not be... me. My selfesteem and confidence is zero, but I put on a happy face. Unfortunately Im funny, so when I finally express how Im really feeling it always comes at a shock. I cant take pictures of myself, I can barely look in the mirror, because I hate what I see. I was required to submit a picture of myself for university and literally had a panic attack. I always give seeminglyaccurate reasons about not posting anything on social media, and I finally came clean to my boyfriend that every reason I dont is because I cant stand myself, and to be honest, I dont think he understood. Hes always been supportive of me and helping me get the help I need, but I dont think he is able to empathize rather than sympathize. I have this selfdisgust and selfhatred. I dont want to see myself in pain or hurt myself, I just dont want to see myself. Im conflicted because one side of my brain I am able to logic my way out of some spiraling thoughts... thanks CBT therapy but the other is just so dark and unforgiving and unrelenting. I thought my meds were working, and I think they are. I think they finally allowed me to see this a bit clearer, but Ive really struggling since. The thing is  I want to get better. I want to be okay, and I just dont know how. Anyone have any direction or thinks to think about?",
    "I just want to quit everything and say @&amp;*% it, need advice Long story 20yo, 3rd year in college and having a very rough patch. I was one of those gifted kids that never studied which started biting me in the butt once I got to IB high school. Got burnt out before I even got to college. Had issues with depression in high school as well. Fast forward to today and this semester isnt even half way over and Im pretty sure Im going to fail 46 of my classes, I have no motivation to do anything nor can I make myself care about not failing exams. I would hate the professors but I just feel too exhausted to give a crap about them. Half the time I dont show up to classes, even the ones I liked at the beginning of the semester, and when I do show up Im sitting staring at a wall or rewatching a dumb video on reddit or instagram or whatever. Ive regularly had suicidal thoughts since high school about jumping off a parking garage or crashing my car but I know Ill never do it because of my family and my pet and responsibilities or whatever. I know I need to work at it and all but I cant seem to find the light at the end of the tunnel. I can feel anxious about failing a class but I cant bring myself to really care about it. My best friend says Im just burnt out and my therapist is considering medication. I just dont know what to do or how to get past just pushing through and get to living for myself. Not sure if this all made sense. TLDR lack of motivation doesnt even come close to describing how I feel about life. Not sure if medication helps this or not and could use some advice in general on how to get through depressive episodes.",
    "Advice? Hi, In advance! Im not the best out there on explaining my feelings since thats very far away from my culture, but Ill try because I dont know what else to do. Im 26 and not too long ago I changed my career path to something which Ive always wanted to do. Prior to this, which was about a year and a half ago I felt as though Ive been in an emotional hole I couldnt get out of. My new job distracted me for a long while, I was even being complimented on how I suddenly seemed like myself again up until about 6 months ago, when I just fell back in to my own bullshit of complete and utter numbness. The issue is, that normally lasts a few weeks for me but its been 6 months or longer now and I cant seem to shake it. I dont want to speak to anybody, I love my family and friends but I cant seem tomake the effort I guess? This resulted in me losing important connections and even severing them because I cant for the life of me understand what the point of them is when I cant be a good person to them. Then I have the audacity to feel loneliness and feel even more sorry for myself  When I do talk to the people I have left I cant focus on the conversation and I just drift off in to absolutely nothing, so it never lasts long. My question is to those who have managed to get through this without medication I cant have medication due to the nature of my job How did you manage to do it? Am I missing something? I will do everything I possibly can to help myself but Ive tried so much. I got back in the gym, Im eating well, Ive meditated, Ive gone for walks, Ive listened to music to self medicate, Ive slept decent amounts. I cant seem to enjoy doing anything anymore and my passion for life has been put out like someone suddenly pissed on a bonfire. I feel like I get closer and closer to giving up everyday and Im just too close to it this time to the point Im starting to scare myself every now and again with the thoughts that come in to my mind. Any suggestions would help so much.",

My friend is really struggling right now and is trying not to eat. I found out from a mutual friend a guy shes talking to romantically and she admitted it to me very willingly herself. She showed me their texts and she was talking about doing it because she wants to kill herself so she wont listen to anyone who tells her to get help. Im thinking about going to the guidance counselor because she already expressed that her parents wont schedule her an appointment even though shes asked. Shes diagnosed with depression because shes had one appointment but never got another. I dont want her to be upset with me and shes telling me herself to force her to eat. So I dont know if I should wait it out or go to the counselor.",

    "I think my mother is toxic Shes always been abusive most of the times verbally and emotional but shes worst than ever this last 23 years. I started living with her 4 or 5 years ago, she didnt want that responsibility and gave me to my grandma. She never really cared about me and never gave me emotional support, however, she always told others how succesful i was at school etc. As soon as the others are gone she starts blaming me for everything, even breathing stupid whatever that means . She makes fun of everything about me and tells me im never gonna be happy or succesful in life. She always curses at me and if i tell her that she misunderstood me shed beat me. She often tells me that i drain her energy everytime shes near me even though i always try to look happy and full of energy because i dont want her to be sad because of me. She thinks i hate her but i dont. I should maybe, i dont know, i just cant since she gave birth to me and looked after me. She gave me money so i could eat. But she always told me bad stuff and made fun of me. She abuses me everyday and makes me feel bad every time. I try not to tell her anything shed be angry about even the way i look at her makes her angry. My existence makes her angry. I thought about ending my life so many times but the people i love comes to my mind, especially my caring boyfriend. I dont want to make anyone sad but i want my mom to be happy. My parents are divorced so i think about living with my dad but hes in another city and cant come here until the virus is not a problem anymore. But i dont know what should i do until my dad comes here. I dont want to make my mom sad or disappointed. How can i make her happy?",

I totally get the reasons why people are the way that they are but if you know you are not parent material why the fuck would you have children, it doesnt make any fucking sense. I was doing alright for a while now, but shit happened and the suicidal feelings are coming back again. And the funniest part is that they actually expect me to stay alive for them? What the actual fuck is this? Suicide is not selfish, because the act of bringing me into this world is selfish. Who the fuck asked for life? Not me, nor do i want it. And expecting me to live and like my life when biologically im fucked is the most selfish thing ive ever heard.ugh am i just being an immature brat or it is justifiable for me to feel this way?",
    "My Friend Is Suffering... Hello. My very good friend has severe major depression. He has been fighting it as long as Ive known him, about 3 years. Recent he moved, leaving his therapist behind. Hes in a situation thats worse than his previous, and he was obviously separated from his treatment team. His depression has gotten much worse since then. Every day he talks about wishing he could die, but feels so hopeless he wont get help. In that state he doesnt think itll help, or doesnt feel he deserves it, regardless of how much I try to convince him otherwise. Im worried for him. Does anyone know have any ideas on what I can do to help? When I ask him, he just says to let him go.",
    "I got cheated on by my now ex-boyfriend of six years and I feel worthless I didnt know because he never opened up to me even when I asked. He then proceeded to ask if I wanted to join him on trip which just took place this Monday through Wednesday. In that moment I got angry. How could you tell me to go on this trip when you just told me you didnt love me? It wasnt logical. We argued and towards the end he said he was done. I asked him to clarify and he needed some space from me. Fine. I let him be until he contact me on Sunday the 10th wanting to meet up the following day. We didnt end up meeting up on Monday and did a follow up instead on Tuesday. We talked. I was worried for him. I told him that people were concerned for his safety and he just laughed it off with the laugh of a maniac. He said that why did people care. He was so distant. Before I left I asked again where we stood. And he told me to give some time. I asked for how long and he told me he would let me know. Fast forward to this Monday. He told me to have any false hope of getting together. We went on our trip and I noticed he was texting a lot while trying to angle himself to hide his phone. It was something I noticed right away. We moved on through the day. We got to our destination. While laying down on my bed he came laid down next to me. It was odd because he didnt want to be close to me previously. We went about our day. Came back to our Airbnb and as I was laying down again he came into my room again and fell asleep next to me. After our naps we went out to explore the town. Had a couple drinks went back to our Airbnb and ended up sleeping together. The day of the concert having woken up from a hangover we just stayed in had some breakfast and watched the hearing. We eventually got ready for the event we were in town for. We ended up getting to the venue early enough where the line was already forming."
