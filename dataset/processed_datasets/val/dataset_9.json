    "my LDR boyfriend admitted he has depression and wants a break because of it he keeps saying things like this, which is hard for me to accept because I know what its like to be depressed. he is pushing me away and hiding this part of himself from me, and I just want nothing more than to support him and be there for him which made me feel like my visit was even more urgent. he kept saying things like how he would feel sorry for me if i tried to stay by his side and support him, and how he doesnt want to burden me with his problems or ruin my bdaychristmasnew years by making me sad. he even said, verbatim The more you care about me, the more I feel bad for you, regardless of what youre saying. I might change my mind later but for now I cant. When I see you care about me, I get hurt. he even offered to pay for my flight because I shouldnt just come there to take care of someone whos full of shit since I cant get a refund, but I refused. Its been about two days, and at the end of our messaging and phone calls, I told him that I am still going to catch that flight, and that Ill give him the space hes asking for, but that Im here whenever he needs me. sorry if its hard to read, and no tldr because I think its important to know everything that I wrote above before saying anything... Im just really desperate to talk to someone about this, and I really do need advicesupport. How can I support him, aside from giving him space? Should I wait for him to reach out to me on his own terms, even if it means not seeing him at all for the 2 weeks Im in the same city as him? How do I keep him from drifting away or getting worse, even with the distance?",
    "I have absolutely no motivation and no will to live..... Im 20, recently Ive noticed that I want to do nothing, except, maybe, die... the thing is, I have also dermatillomatia since I was 14, I tried taking some antidepressants, which my psychiatrist has prescribed me, but, unfortunately, they didnt suit me. So, my life is getting more shitty each day. Yesterday I turned 20. I was with my parents, because I have only one friend, who is my roommate and now I have no will to expand the circle of friends... I was crying all the time and my parents were crying too...such a horrible birthday... I didnt mean to hurt my parents. So, now my mom is planing to be by my side Ive moved to another city, which is 1500km away from my hometown, to start university till I pass my exams, and then Ill be examined to find out which pills for sure will help me. But, still, I need any tips from you guys which maybe would help me to survive this months......",
    "Death Anxiety Hey all. Sorry if this seems unhinged. Im just gonna try to get it all out. In the last month and a half, Ive been having unwanted deep philosophical thoughts on how we perceive time, what the self is, and that we all die eventually. Ive been diagnosed with depression since I was 16 when I first had these thoughts hit me in a big way and Im 27 now. Zoloft has always helped, but Ive been bad about my meds for the last year or so so Im having a relapse, I get this. But the thing is, the stuff Im worrying about feels so real. These arent Im bad, or no one loves me, or I want to hurt other people thoughts. Theyre on a deeper, simpler level. Sometimes I wonder if Im being treated for depression when Im actually just seeing the truths of existence clearer than a lot of other people else and that makes me feel hopeless that Ill ever feel better. Like the system might not be equipped to help me. It makes me so sad. The problem with my worries is that theyre real worries. Im mainly concerned with why do anything at all if were just animals who die. I AM going to die. There probably ISNT a soul. I WILL eventually cease to exist. All the stuff I care about is just electricity and matter and chrmicals in the brain telling me I care about stuff. The I isnt even necessarily real, its just a collection of smaller parts. I know that the classic reddit atheist way of getting through this stuff is just saying life is what you make of it, but when really confronted by the seeming truth that the self will disappear when we die, I guess it just rings kind of hollow. Like, yes of course I love my girlfriend and our pets and my parents and my friends, and I love to make art and perform, I want to go to grad school and get married and have kids. And doing that stuff makes me feel great! But lately Ive just been under this cloud of none of this has purpose even if you pretend it does. Like, Ill feel great doing these things and then Ill think that was nice, but Im going to forget that it happened and cease to exist eventually.",
    "Even at the worst moments of my depression, I could still see a bright future ahead. Now I have nothing to look forward to, and I’m seriously considering suicide. Im 16. Ive been bullied my whole life and been depressed since I was around 14. Ive always had this idea that things will get better in the future, It will be better next year, It will be better when Im 20, 25, 30... I just realized that it wont. I, like everyone else, am bound to work til the day I die, but on the top of that, I have to deal with mental illness. Is this a life worth living? I have zero friends, I have no supportive family. Most days I just stand there, staring at the walls, doing nothing. Im completely uninteresting as a person. Given my high school history, I will certainly not get into a good college. Im objectively ugly, as I have a very unsymmetrical face. I cant remember the last time I felt happy I have nobody left in my life. Whats out there for me?",
    "Feel like friends don’t like me Made some friends at the end of December last year I think and now they wont even talk to me...so Im probably not gonna go to the pride thing anymore tbh its not fun and whenever I do go and my new friends just leave me to go do their own things and when I tried to ask Jess to go the the ball thing with me she instead ignored me and chose someone else so dont think Ill be going to that either... I just feel like if they really were my friends they wouldnt be ignoring me all the time...and basically I feel extremely upset and depressed about it and been crying again because I thought I finally found some good people to be friends with but apparently thats not the case as per usual",
    "I feel irritated all the time and it gets worse when I try to study something. Currently recovering from anxiety and extreme amounts of stress. I feel slightly irritated all the time. When I am listening to nonsense podcastsjokes, random nonsense, wrestling then I feel ok. When I try to listen to an audiobook or a podcast where I have to pay attention I get very irritated and tired. I also feel stressed. Yesterday this irritation got so bad that I felt it was hard to contain it. It feels like pain and burning in my head. I am currently not working due to sick leaves. I will be seeing my psychologist tomorrow. Any suggestions? Any food or activity that would help me?",
    "The more I live the more I realise how much I don't fit in And I never will. I feel like a constant burden to be around. I feel like people are sick of me and dont take me seriously. Im a loser. I like loser things. My passions are film, art and cooking. All loser passions. I just feel like finally giving up. My friend ditched me since getting a girlfriend and here I am alone. People just think Im a weirdo and now I believe it. I just dont know which way to turn. Its always been like this and I dont even know anymore. Should I disappear or should I work through it. Im awkward to my boss and I dont think Ill get a promotion. No one wants to help me with my film ideas. I dont know anymore. Im going to sleep it off and wake up tomorrow. I feel confusion from every part of my brain",
    "I kill myself if you don’t read My upbringing only perpetuated my depression. My single mom never gave me responsibilities and I had too much free time. Making it worse I was a nerd so having the option to just stay inside and play video games was heaven. Years went by without speaking with anyone or trying to build relationships. In my teen years that was basically suicide because who wants to be known as the loner. So I would skip days to keep my fragile ego safe. Thoughts go by in my head that if I could just at the very least get over my fear for rejection I could get my life in order. Because having an intimate relationship would really solve a lot of current issues I have. And so Im actively looking subconsciously and consciously because i am starving for intimacy. I know how that would look desperate maybe a bit crazy. And its not about sex its about completely being open and honest with another person. I feel I can only be this intimate with a girl and refuse to open up to such an extent to the access of other human beings in my life. Because the human being in my life were not driven by choice ie family, childhood friends Im in a pickle and it sucks, but if it wasnt for weed I would not be aware of my issues, stayed positive and attempt to help myself. This is only a recent discovery ever since joe Rogan started talking about how weed paranoias actually help you figure out what is actually stressing you out. Thats the worst about depression, every action you do against yourself feels justified and logical. Its truly a terrible disease and I hope I survive this. Sorry about title Im just so desperate I apologize for my existence.",
    "Opening up Hiya! So Im a student at uni and I find it really hard to stay motivated to go to classdo anything most of the time. I hate that I feel that way, I was pretty depressed a few years back and now I feel like I might be relapsing in a way. The thing is though, my dads coming to see me in a few days, so hes going to be able to tell that I havent been that great. Usually when people come to visit me I try to hide all evidence of depression unwashed dishes, clothes everywhere, general messiness almost like an addict would hide their evidence. But now I dont even have the energy for that anymore. Im thinking of just admitting to my dad that Im not that well, but I know that would break both my parents heart. I just want them to be proud of me and I feel like right now Im not someone anyone could be proud of. I want to be able to function on my own and do great things but apparently Im not capable of that. Anyway my point is Should I be completely open with my parents about how Ive been feeling? Even though I know theyll be incredibly worried about me and maybe even disappointed? Should I start therapy again and never talk about depression with anyone else but a therapist? Because when I talk to friends or family about it I always feel like a burden and that Im hurting them. What do you guys think?",
    "I can’t make it stop I have reoccurring thoughts and day dreams of ending it. Day and night just seeing myself downing my stash of pills before going to bed or copying 13 reasons and going out in the tub. It helps to have distractions like personal time or gaming but its getting harder to focus on hobbies projects and stuff like that. I feel like Jack Nickelson in Over the Coo Coos Nest or Shining. I dont trust the places I have left to vent. Reddit always buried my posts for help which reeeeaaaly helps with the invisible feeling and the only people I feel confident enough to confined in are too busy. In a fucked up sense I dont want to go into therapy other than lack of funds because I could be taking time from the therapist helping someone... worth it. If that makes any sense.",
    "Both me and my spouse are depressed It just feels hopeless. Its like we werent meant for this world. Im lucky I found him because I have no doubt that I wouldnt be here today without him, but Im scared that Im making him worse, that I cant help him get up and do things because I myself cant motivate myself to do the same thing. I always feel like a burden, even though he insists that he doesnt think of me that way. I just want to make him happy. I want him to have a good life. But I dont know how to do that, and even if I did, Im afraid I wouldnt be capable regardless.",
    "I'm seriously considering suicide again. Im getting tired of posting here repeatedly, not because of the sub itself actually, it helped me go through tough times but because I have no one else to talk to except internet strangers. The post is long, bear with me. This might be my last post, and I want to have to get some things out of my chest. I am very tired, and havent been really feeling anything since yesterday, after I got back from Chicago, so it might be a bit messy, and just... not organized at all. But here goes Im so lonely. I want people to like me. But all I am is a waste. A waste of time, resources, and opportunities. By no means am I the unluckiest person around. I have an above average IQ 152 WISC, 149 WAIS, I have certain traits that Id like to be proud of, such as being orderly and responsible, speaking 3 languages fluently EN, ES, KR and 2 languages in the beginner level FR and ZH and know a couple of more alphabets like Cyrillic, Greek and Yiddish, and I absolutely love to learn, read, and to experience. but somehow, even with all that, I managed to be the biggest fucking trainwreck I could possibly imagine. My father locked me in dark rooms for hours when I was 3 to 5. I was diagnosed w T1D when I was 5. I was always a bit weak, underweight. I started having behavioral problems since 10, including but not limited to violent tendencies, compulsive lying, stealing I dont know if its kleptomania, I hope its not. But even if it is, wont make another difference. Just another problem on my list, etc. I was diagnosed with Night Terrors and Bipolar Depression when I was 12, 13 maybe. I have suffered from achluophobia and a mild claustrophobia, as well as some social issues. I wont label my social issues, as I havent got a clinical diagnosis like anyhting else on this list, but I think it fits more into the antisocial category than asocial or social anxiety, because of my negative and possibly misanthropist views.",
    "Never had anywhere near the success I want in life I 25m am currently unemployed. Ive really struggled to make friends I have a few now or date anyone in life. As well, I hated commuting to university and my BA and MA arent too useful. All the career fields I want to go into civil service, high school teacher, physician, government lawyer are extremely competitive to get into. Ive been unemployed for a year now and I cant get myself to apply for jobs because I really lack any practical skills or relevant experience Ive only worked in retail and as a TA. Im not even sure I have it in me to go back to school for something more practical and I frankly I dont really want to. Im just sick of trying in life and never really getting anywhere I want to. I have little to show for the last 7 years of my life. This lack of success makes it impossible for me to believe Ill do better in my life. I might just commit suicide in a year or two. Im probably too much a coward and failure but still.",
    "Are anti-depressants worth taking? I 25m have been unemployed since finishing my MA for over a year now. Are antidepressants worth taking? My doctor offered them and I think Im going to look into a new therapist. I think I might have some sort of ADHD or anxiety instead but Im not too sure. I live in Canada so its going to be a few not that before I can see a psychiatrist. Im really struggling to apply for jobs rn. This is sort of killing me. Are antidepressants worth taking in your experience? Ive heard some bad things about them and Im worried.",
    "Can depression make you feel like you lost feelings for your partner? I was dating my bf for 1.5 years and both of us were deeply and truly in love with each other. I could tell. He suddenly said he lost feelings because of his depression and he tried to get them back but it never felt the same as it did before. Is it his depression that is making him feel this way or is it reality? He said that he doesnt know how long it will take to fix himself and he doesnt want me to wait for him because it isnt fair for me. I love him and Im willing to wait because his parents are the reason for his depression. When he moves out he will def feel that baggage left from his mind. He even hates them and is upset that he has to stay with them the whole summer before college. He even got drunk with alcohol because of his depression. And he never did this before. Do you think he actually lost feelings or that his feelings are being concealed because of the severe depression? He said he did love me before and a part of him still loves me now. But then Im confused because he told me to move on because its not fair for me to wait. Like i really love him and thats why im willing to wait. And he even said he doesnt know about later when he moves out because he feels like he cannot be fixed at all. He said he is depressed to the point where nobody can fix him. He sounded extremely depressed which made me hurt because I wanted to see him happy.",
    "please help. i am a 15 year old male at 55 and weighing at around 90lbs. idk if i have an eating disorder or depression, but i always starve myself for days when im feeling really down. i have my moments where i want to change my life for the better, which is usually after these moments of starvation end, but ive never been consistent due to the fact that i end up starving myself over and over again. i realized i do this because i want to die. i starve myself until i cant take it anymore and im forced to eat by a friend or parent. im not sure what to do. this endless cycle of sadness feels so tiring i want to just end everything. my self esteem is so low and i have nothing to look forward to. i ask for some advice to make at least something easier. thank you.",
    "So, I decided to go to psychiatrist, but now I feel like Im not that bad? How bad is really bad? Maybe I just act dramatic I cry a lot without any specific reason, I want to kill myself quite often, but... I dont know if I really need therapy? Maybe its just who I am, just a lazy whiner? And when I will come to therapist I dont know what to say, what if that day I will feel fine and they will not believe me? I dont look like I struggle all the time, people around me dont even know that I have problems, Ive always been a comedian in a company. Im just a little bit afraid. I dont know if i really need therapy, and if I dont, so what do I need to feel normal?",
    "Every night just before drifting off to sleep, I'm overwhelmed with feelings of self hate and guilt. Im a seasoned pro in dealing with depression but this is getting out of hand. It used to happen every once in a while, but now its consistent every night. As I lay here with my eyes closed and I begin to dream, suddenly I realize Im a horrible employee and Im on the verge of losing my job. Or Im a horrible father and my son deserves better. Or Im a horrible husband who should have let someone better marry my wife and make her happy. Or I suddenly realize my finances are messed up for someone my age. Or I feel like Im the worst kind of friend. The tremendous feeling of guilt is absolutely overwhelming and I wake up and have to often times sit up, my heart pounding like crazy. The house is a mess, Ive been working on the same task too long at work and theyre going to find out Im a fraud, I have a ton of yard work I need to do and the neighbors think Im a total slob, my son doesnt feel loved and needs better things in life. The list expands exponentially if I let it, even as I type it out its flowing in like a river of crippling worry, my face is completely bloodshot like Im embarrassed, and I cant catch my breath. All I want to do is go on facebook and tell everyone how sorry I am for being so embarrassing. Or go sit at my desk and work more so I have more to report on in the standup. Or go lay with my 4 year old son and tell him how proud of him I am and how great his Lego creation tonight was. Or clean and organize the whole house so my wife wakes up and feels good about being married to me. I get this frantic feeling like it all needs to happen, but its too late, the day is over, and I messed up again. I did not feel this way an hour ago when I laid down in my bed. It spikes in me just before drifting off to sleep, like I was watching my life in a movie but then I suddenly realize its real and I am overcome with fear, dread, embarrassment, and guilt, like Im driving a train off a bridge or something.",

    "How can I (28f) help my Mum (56f) who is depressed and considering suicide. My Mum has struggled with severe depression ever since her early teens. She has been on a variety of antidepressants on and off for many years and has attempted suicide to the best of my knowledge twice before. She has never kept up with therapy of any sort as she doesnt believe it works. Previously when she fell into a depressive state she would become incredibly pessimistic and irritable, withdrawn, sleep long hours  really just your average symptoms of depression. In recent times over the last 6 months her behaviour has escalated to the point where I am deeply concerned that she will attempt suicide again She doesnt socialise. She has always had a small social group but is now not even engaging in the two things she had been keeping up with for years daily gym and a monthly book club and refuses to do anything new due to the cost. She hates her job and her coworkers, but will not look for other employment because she considers herself too old to get employment elsewhere. Her hatred of her workplace has escalated to the point where she will literally just leave, without advising anyone, and go home to bed. She justifies this as they wouldnt notice me if i was there anyway. Previously she has always had an incredibly strong work ethic, she wouldnt miss a day ever! She is unwilling to stay on antidepressants for extended periods. She doesnt like that they make her gain weight 5kgs OR shes feels that they have done their job and stops taking them cold turkey. This particular behaviour has been an ongoing problem for as long as I can remember but now she wont even consider making an appointment to get a script. She is sending nasty texts and emails to her siblings and cousins, accusing them of imagined petty insults towards her and reacting disproportionately when they tell her that she is acting inappropriately and needs to seek help, she believes they are just trying to get rid of her. Previously they had a friendly but distant relationship without regular contact.",

I dont really know if Im depressed or not because I have never been to therapy and probably never will because Its hella expensive from where Im from. I dont want to selfdiagnose my depression because I just find that weird and wrong. I was 12 when I first harmed myself, I dont think I did it a lot but back then, I just thought I was just influenced with the whole emo phase a lot of people my age then was so into. I had a few attempts growing up, and thats when I started thinking maybe I really am depressed, because even If i didnt do it constantly throughout the years since I first did it, there would be days where I thought dying would just be the best option because I felt so shitty all the time. I googled the symptoms of depression as I grew older and would relate to most of it, BUT i still could not find myself to think that I am depressed since I have not even checked in with a professional. Today, I have been feeling so bad about everything, I could explain In details about my life but It wont be necessary for this post. Some days theres a reason for me to be sad, and some days I just dont know whats the root of my sadness. I would just feel like shit even though I had a great day, and I could never really point out WHY im sad and it frustrates me until I cry and just try to exhaust myself and sleep and hope that I feel better when I wake up.

    "Divorce and depression Hi everyone, Please forgive any misspellings or runons. Focus isnt one of my strong suits at the moment. This is my first post here so I appreciate any advice. So I am at the beginning stages of divorce, which is definitely making my depression worst. I am sure I am about to name off items that people deal with daily or have gone through so please forgive me for redundancy. We have a 3 year old daughter and weve been together for 7 to 8 years 9 married 5 years. Ive never in my life felt anything as soul crushing as this. I cant sleep and even if I do I cant escape through my dreams because its all I dream about. Im 35 years old and I have gone through heartbreaks throughout my years but nothing like this. I dont know what to do... I dont want to hit the bottles cause I know that isnt healthy. The thought of even dating down the road when im ready makes me sick. I honestly want to die but dont have the balls to off myself. Work is a struggle, eating is a struggle, working out is a struggle...this might sound odd but right now I would love to trade places with a tree or just an object that has no feelings.... I dont really have friends, me and family dont communicate, I dont really have anyone thus why I am on here making a post. I though I knew pain but I didnt. Im really struggling, this is the hardest thing in my life at the moment and i feel like my world has come crashing down. Hell I probably cry 36 times a day, short spurts to long cries.

    "Let's be realistic I stand at the gateway between being stuck in my head and living in reality. You could imagine it like an arched doorway, about 12 feet tall. The door itself is made of rocks, placed almost like bars. The support frame is metal, cold, blue. On the inside, behind the door, its cold, its empty, its black. Filled with images if the past, things that I regret, pain, scars. There are two chains on the floor, not far from where I stand. Those chains were what I used to rattle to summon or conjure back the moments I feel I missed. Like opportunities that had passed me by, like love lost by the way side, like all the memories I just cant seem to let go, like all the people Ive lost along this road. But on the other side there is a light thats beaming bright. I can feel the warmth of the air brush my sides and I feel the urge to come running. Like its calling out my name, like I no longer need to be ashamed of who I am today, like everything Ive ever known has a chance to change. But my biggest struggle is in letting go. My biggest fear of losing control, yet I just need to find my way home, I dont want to be trapped here forever, inside the cold, growing abyss. Reminiscing all the opportunities I missed. I dont want to die here alone, yet Im so afraid to move forward, as I navigate this dark night of the soul. Sometimes its hard enough just to breathe, as I feel the light taking over me. All the damage hidden underneath brought to life, im forced to see and the well behind my eyes, it opens up, it opens wide.

    "When to walk away.. Hi, I 29F have been seeing someone 29M who suffers from depression and anxiety. Right now it seems like his depression has gotten worse where he has a low sex drive, sleeps all day, is gaining weight and has started smoking again. Hes told me he wants to stop seeing me but when I ask him how come he just says he doesnt know or is overwhelmedconfused. And that he thinks he doesnt like me the way he thought he did when we first met. Ive kind of tried to get him to elaborate but he said theres no point in evaluating it. I was hurt but in the back of my head I cant help but think is he self sabotaging? Is this his depression thats overwhelming him and clouding his judgment? I asked him if he was pushing me away because he didnt like me anymore or if he was too overwhelmed. He said he wasnt trying to push me away but that hes not well atm. I told him I cared about him and that Ill respect his boundaries and give him space for now. But after reading posts on this sub Im even more confused, should I give him the space he says he wants or should I continue to try and be there for him physically and emotionally? Am I being naive? I suffer from depression and anxiety as well so I sympathize with him and from my own experience Im known to self sabotage. Id want someone to fight for me and thats what Im doing for him but idk how to tell if he truly wants me to fight for him or not. Thanks for taking the time to read this long post, Id appreciate any advice you have.",
    "Trying to encourage a friend to seek help and need advice. So my friend has depression, were in our 30s, and I do not know how to get him help. Hes afraid of doctors, medication, alcohol. He has very bad social anxiety. He doesnt have strong from his family who are all pretty dismissive about this. He basically only has me and Im not a professional by any means. When he gets depressed he starts shutting people out, I try not to push him to hard because Im afraid he could possibly spiral. Hes having a particularly bad few weeks recently and the last time things got really bad he shut everyone out for two years. Hes put his life on hold for years because hes afraid and sad all the time.

    "I've always been depressed but somethings different. Lately Ive been having extreme difficulty leaving my room. Everytime Im around anyone my heart starts racing and I feel like Im having a panic attack. I also keep hearing people Whispering to me but I cant tell what they say and sometimes they manifest as full on people that I can see and carry on conversations with. Also Ive been noticing that everything has a dark and sinister undertone. I hear peoples conversations and things on TV and I cant help but think they relate to me and my living situation in a dark and sinister way somehow. And Ive completely given up trying to talk to anyone about anything because no one can understand me. They say I talk too fast or say things that dont make sense or that they find incoherent and Lately i feel my life is just dragging on and on. Idk it just feels like Ive become a ghost of myself and Im being driven by something else. Like some baleful evil shadow from beyond time and space has grabbed onto my soul and slipped itself into my television consciousness and is now possessing me. Please help? Is it normal to feel this way?",

Other people have friends and family but I have no one. Suicide phone lines dont help me one bit and besides, Ive called too much at this point and I consider myself a nuisance to them. Ive attempted to make friends but I always ruin it or theyre not interested and ghost me, let me tell you, being thosed or ignored is one of the worst feelings when youre lonely and trying to reach out for that human connection.

    "Stuck between moving forward and killing myself Though I dont see the point of putting in all this effort to do things if it doesnt make me happy. I dont even have the energy or motivation for it. Every time I hear someone say Move on!, Man up!, Do this or do that, I already feel the pressure and it cripples me. Its not even that I dont want to do it. I really want to live a good and healthy life, but its like I am incapable of doing so. Seeing other people getting further in life also paralyzes me as well as watching vids on how to improve myself. Everything just scares me and paralyzes me. Still, I know its the only way out of this and my only chance of ever getting her back. However, there is no guarantee Ill get her back. So that thought is depressing on its own. And dont get me wrong. I know there are other girls out there. That is not the problem. I am not ugly and I can date girls, and I have done so for months already. I have had bad dates and great dates, and I have met great girls I could picture a relationship with, but it simply doesnt do it for me. I want my ex. Even when I put all the emotions aside and try to rationalize it, then I still want her. Right now I just feel trapped. Moving forward wont make me happy. It is not enough. Though sitting still and doing nothing wont make me happy either. At this point, suicide seems like the only solution, but even that is a scary and hard thing to do. However, I feel its the right thing to do as I feel far too broken and useless to continue this unsatisfying life. I wish there was some magical solution. I wish my ex would give the benefit of the doubt. I wish she would give me another chance. I wish she would make that sacrifice to help me. Though I know that that is ridiculous. I know that I have to do it all by myself that it is my responsibility... but I cannot do it anymore.",
    "Feeling frustrated/numb for no good reason? A week ago I had an argument with someone close and it kind of escalated. We worked things out and everything is fine. The problem is that Ive been feeling frustrated and numb ever since. I have barely any energy and am just proud that I get out of bed in the morning. Whenever I genuinely feel something it is a mix of anger against myself and frustration. What would you do to overcome this? At the moment I am not interested in a therapist. Not too long ago, I had bad experiences with a psychologist that caused major trust issues. Before I seek professional help, I will have to come to terms with this. Any suggestions on how to get better?",
    "16 year old struggling with depression and drugs Hey guys, Im 16 years old and I have had alcohol a few times, and it used to be somewhat of a problem for me. When I was 15, I only had alcohol about once a month, but I always fantasized about it, and when I had it, I tried to have a lot. I was really really depressed back then, and I have tons of selfharm scars and a few suicide attempts. And now, Ive gotten extremely depressed again. My exbest friend really victimized herself and said terrible things to me, stuff like that our whole friendship was based on lies and that Ive hurt her in ways that she couldnt imagine. This is due to lies that her abusive boyfriend had been feeding her, and he is a really bad person and talks trash about her so much and spills her secrets and doesnt have morals. I snapped when she was saying some really hurtful stuff to me and I told her everything her boyfriend did, which I think led to her saying those even more mean things to me. She ended up basically blocking me on everything. I went to a party yesterday and she was there and I felt so disconnected and lonely, and I vaped for the first time in a while, and there was a box cutter and I went to the bathroom to cut myself and I just felt so much better. Ive also been fantasizing about alcohol so that I could stop feeling. i have tons of goals for college and life, and I dont want to sound stuck up but I have pretty good chances at a top 10 college if I keep what I have going. But this has really clouded me, that someone who knew so much about me just rejected me like that and treated me like that and I just want to stop feeling. Does anybody have any advice? P. S. I promise that I wont be pming anyone to stop me from harming myself or anything like that. I would really appreciate real, actionable steps that can help me just forget about this situation and go back to working hard. For example, Ive heard that meditation could be really beneficial, and has anyone here tried it?",
    "A bit of a strange case: Exercise has DESTROYED my mental health. Thoughts? Advice? more than I hated swimming. Every second of my 95 minute sessions felt like torture. The intensity didnt matter, as even super lowintensity sessions made me doubt my sanity. But, because Id been so used to doing a huge amount of cardio every day, I literally made myself go to the gym to row. This sent me into a deep depression. I dreaded waking up every day, as I knew that I would have to go do a torturous rowing session at some point during the day. After watching a video on existentialism and Nietzsche, I decided to completely change my life and viewpoint. I realized that what Id been doing for the past year and a half or so was INSANE. What was the point of doing so much cardio? I was already fairly skinny, and I had no plans of becoming an athlete. I realized that I needed to live life to the fullest and actually enjoy myself, rather than wake up every day to torture myself. So I completely stopped doing rowing, and reoriented my fitness focus to strength training, the activity which I had enjoyed for so long. But unfortunately, this didnt work out. The toxic attitude I had regarding rowing poisoned my once beloved activitystrength traininglifting. I hyperfocused on the negative aspects of lifting the pain, the struggle, the discomfort. I no longer enjoyed lifting, instead, I dreadedhated it. It felt like torture as well. This only worsened my depression, as I realized that NO form of exercise would help, or even just have a neutral effect on my mental health. I took a twoweek break from all exercise a couple of weeks ago, and yes, I managed to distract myself with other activities, but when I returned to lifting, my depression returned. Imagine knowing that, for four out of seven days a week, you will be stabbed, shocked, beaten, and tortured. That is how I feel and how I have felt for what seems like so long. I feel like Im a prisoner in Guantanamo Bay, and frankly, Im surprised that more people havent killed themselves in that godforsaken place.",
    "Morning depression and how to handle it. Hello everyone. This is my first post in this sub. I was wondering, does anyone have any methods or anything to make morning depression go away? I sleep and wake up at the same time every day so I dont think that theres any problem in that regard. I also do exercise and eat well but the symptoms dont let up. Ive seen that these can be symptoms of major depression but I dont know how could that be, since I feel pretty good the rest of the day. Maybe some days are worse than others but idk. It hurts a lot. Every morning Im scared of waking up since I know that anything will make me feel depressed. Oh you have online classes? How about thinking that you should drop out because you have zero motivation to do any schoolwork? Youre watching a reality show? How about thinking that you are worthless and that you will never find a girlfriend since youre stuck in your house all day? Its tiring to be feeling this way every morning, and what my therapist asks me is just at what time of the day do I get depressed so that he can find the cause. But the thing is, that cause can be literally anything.",

My depression and anxiety lift, and I start enjoying life until the next day. Im off medication for a couple of months, but to be honest, I feel better now than when I was on meds.

They never wanted much to do with me, especially when I started developing mental health issues 8 years ago. They slowly but surely made their way out of my life and upset me in the most awful ways. I have no friends. I moved into university and left my friends at home, and I really struggled to make new friends here. I have one, my flatmate, but thats it, no one else wants anything to do with me. Im even considering moving back home to a mother who really dislikes me and made my life a living hell, I cant stay here at uni. I have no one left. I have no reason to live anymore.

I might have options to get out of my depression, like certain pills, maybe PMS pills antidepressants seem to never work but my depression gets 10 times worse around my period and maybe counseling would work. Maybe these things would work if I tried them again even if they havent in the past, but for two reasons I haventbesides cost. First I dont think theyd work or the side effects to meds wouldnt be worth it. But second and perhaps more important idk that I want to get better, I feel like I should live with all the shitty feelings and guilt, like I have to or deserve to. I dont do it for attention, maybe once in my life when I was much more lost, when all this depression started to get bad, but not anymore, I barely even talk about my depression to anyone anymore.

Almost nothing phases or interests me anymore. I feel like I get every coldflu virus that comes around. And it takes me much longer to get over them. I am emotionally flat lined. One of my eyelids droops a little bit, mostly later in the day andor when Im more tired. I feel like I need lots of sleep to recover, but all sleep really does is reset me a little bit and is very unrefreshing. All of these symptoms seem to be worse when Im sick, stressed, get less sleep, etc. Overall, it feels like I was hit by a truck. From the moment I wake up to the moment I pass out from sheer exhaustion at night. Everything feels like its suppressed by this fog that has gradually gotten worse over time. For example, caffeines effect, sex drive, postworkout adrenaline and endorphins, getting plenty of sleep, etc. I can sort of FEEL all these things for the most part, but it feels hidden and pushed down from this utter exhaustion. Its like nothing can surpass the fatigue and fog. Its gotten to the point where I feel like Im living my life from the backseat and am just going through the day mindlessly on autopilot. It literally gives me anxiety and depression to feel like this and not know why, and watch my life just pass me by at the same time.

This persons advice to me was just, Just try harder. You can always try harder. And they refused to understand that sometimes you just cant try any harder, you reach your limit, or even that you might need the help of someone else to help get you through. They said that needing anyone elses help is toxic and unhealthy and thats using someone as crutch, you will never get better, etc. Just completely disregarding everything I am feeling and going through.

He then proceeded to ask if I wanted to join him on trip which just took place this Monday through Wednesday. In that moment I got angry. How could you tell me to go on this trip when you just told me you didnt love me? It wasnt logical. We argued and towards the end he said he was done. I asked him to clarify and he needed some space from me. Fine. I let him be until he contact me on Sunday the 10th wanting to meet up the following day. We didnt end up meeting up on Monday and did a follow up instead on Tuesday. We talked. I was worried for him. I told him that people were concerned for his safety and he just laughed it off with the laugh of a maniac. He said that why did people care. He was so distant. Before I left I asked again where we stood. And he told me to give some time. I asked for how long and he told me he would let me know. Fast forward to this Monday. He told me to have any false hope of getting together. We went on our trip and I noticed he was texting a lot while trying to angle himself to hide his phone. It was something I noticed right away. We moved on through the day. We got to our destination. While laying down on my bed he came laid down next to me. It was odd because he didnt want to be close to me previously. We went about our day. Came back to our Airbnb and as I was laying down again he came into my room again and fell asleep next to me. After our naps we went out to explore the town. Had a couple drinks went back to our Airbnb and ended up sleeping together. The day of the concert having woken up from a hangover we just stayed in had some breakfast and watched the hearing. We eventually got ready for the event we were in town for. We ended up getting to the venue early enough where the line was already forming.",
    "Feeling alone I have reached a point where I need a lot of support but I feel like such a burden. I work remotely and independently. My school program is online. Despite living with family, I spend most of the time home alone because of different schedules and conflict between people. I try to reach out to friends, but theyre all busy living their life. I dont really have anyone I feel that I can call when things get really bad. Even when I do talk,my friends say that everyone gets lonely and that Ill be okay but I feel like Im going crazy. And lately Im just tired. I think about ending things everyday. Im tired",
    "I am falling off track of everything I am 28 , graduated 5 months back and havent found a job yet . I have been rejected after multiple final rounds . Now its come to the point where I dont believe things will work out . Not comparing but cant stop thoughts of being scared for myself , when I hear everyone in my batch has a job . I used to be a person who would wake up before sunrise , eat healthy , read books and learn new things . I was someone who would never skip a workout , eat only clean foods , meditate every day and take care of my skin. Now, I dont get out of my bed and dont even look forward to the next day , cos its the same thing on loop , pushing myself to apply for jobs with no belief in whatever I am doing . I miss my workouts and feel lazy to cook for myself , I will order food from a restaurant often which does not feel good after eating at all . I can not do anything other that eating and sleeping . I miss the old me , I used to be a very strong woman . People used to compliment me for my mental strength. I have been through a lot in the past and have overcome it but this time I am unable to get myself back . I dont know this me . Above all this , I live with a roommate who for some reason enjoys when I get rejected from an interview. I have seen that on his face . Even when he knows that I didnt get the job he would on purpose ask me again how did my interview go . Other than that he cares about nothing , and has a very weird vibe . He talks about me to his friends, I dont even know these people and when they come home , they literally know each and everything about me . And to add to this, I feel the need for someone to tell me that I am good enough but I dont get it . I seek that from my father but he is just worried that if I will find a job or not . He doesnt say that out loud but I can read that from our conversations , so I dont feel like speaking at home . I dont know whats so wrong with me that I can just lose myself like this . I want me back .",

I adopted a kitten and my depression disappeared a little, every night I cried myself to sleep but with her I sleep better at night. A new years purpose was to be more sociable, make new friends, go out and do everything I didnt do because of my constant depression. everything was going well, I even met and I had a date with a guy who made me feel things I hadnt felt in a long time. but now none of my friends talk to me, not even the guy who used to talk to me every day until midnight. they even lied to me to exclude me from plans. I try to talk to them but they ignore me.

I feel helpless, unable to reach out to anyone either because they dont care, or they just dont know how to help me and that makes me feel even worse. I feel like my mood naturally pushes them away. I dont know if I want to hear anyone say hey pal, this is temporary, youll feel better later because this also means that I will feel like this again in the future too, and I just need it to stop once and for all, I dont know if I can fight much longer.",
    "Everything Feels Too Overwhelming I feel overwhelmed at the slightest things. This has been happening for a long, long time but it just keeps getting worse. Some days are better than others. Today is a bad day. I quite my job in January to live my dream of being a fulltime artist. I am failing so hard. Yes, COVID really impacted everything but if Im being completely honest, I was never cut out for this to begin with. Ive taken on commissioned work that is months overdue because the thought of starting is so overwhelming. I keep telling myself, tomorrow I will start and I feel relieved. I wanted to make art today first time in months and even got excited at the idea of going to the art store, but then I just thought it will just be another piece that sits there and goes unfinished. I killed all of my excitement before I even did anything. This isnt me. I used to love to create art more than anything and spent almost every spare second painting. I havent started and I feel guilt and shame everyday. I feel stuck. I cant start and I feel like absolute shit for my behaviour. I also run an online vintage shop. I built the new website back in February and was SO proud and excited about it. I havent touched it since. I want to, I want to work on it, but now I have SO many pieces of clothing that need to be cleaned, photographed, listed, measured, that its again....overwhelming. I cant bring myself to start and just look at all the beautiful clothing just sitting there every single day. Some days I scroll through my phone for hours because Im looking for a sign or a solution. Im wasting my life. I hate feeling this way. I hate living this way. Im unhappy no matter what I do and Im feeling SO much guilt for letting so many people down. Im 30 years old too old to be acting this way. Its so shameful. I also keep thinking that its too late for me to make any changes. Whats the point in trying to do better if I havent already figured it out by now.",

    "My depressed partner drains me So here is the thing. I know hes depressed and I know that he is busy with surviving day to day. But Im pissed. I sometimes get so angry and frustrated with him. He doesnt go to therapy and I dont know, if he really tried to get a therapist but the waiting lists are too long or if he didnt try hard enough. He wont tell me. Same thing with his job situation. I dont know, if he is searching and for what. Everytime I ask him, what he wants to be or do he tells me, he doesnt know. And I started asking him really deconstructed questions like what kind of activities writing textsorganizing eventsmaking statistic sheetsetc do you like? do you want to work alone or in a team? what goals helping people and what kind of peopleincomeetc do you want to be met? and so on. Its always I dont know. I am getting really impatient. Its been six years and he has so much potential that he doesnt see or use. Everytime I suggest something, he doesnt use that info, but feels stupid, becaus he didnt have the idea himself. Doesnt matter that I keep reassuring him that it is okay, to need help or not know everything on the spot. He feels stupid and blocks any further conversation and than i find myself trying to calm him down and in the end he promises me to change things, but never does. Probably because he really doesnt have the energy, I get that on an intellectual level. I understand it. I still feel extremely frustrated. This whole situation keeps our life on hold. It didnt matter to me for a long time. I always told myself, that he will find his way and that he will figure everything out, but now we are in our thirties and I really want to start a family. I want to get married and have children and start the next chapter. I cant do that with a man who barely survives. And it starts to severely affect me.",

    "I don’t know why I’m seeking help here but please just read as much as you can... So Im 15 and for most of my life Ive been treated not badly but like Im really different as if there were something wrong with me pretty much only in school since kindergarten. Other than that Ive always been a happy kid with a great sense of humour but in the last few years since becoming a teen things have crashed down on me. I believe it was 2015 my close nan my mums side, ill get to why thats important later was diagnosed with dementia other nan lives on a farm outside my town where she barely sees anybody. In 2017 my cat that I had only had for about 5 years when he came to my doorstep seemingly only a few weeksmonths old suddenly died from chest cancer and I felt sad mainly because I didnt have much to do with him even though I loved him so much. Although I have had a few pet losses this hurt me for a few months tear down my face as Im writing this. The main reason it was so bad was how a normal day turned into hearing he was unable to move when my Aunty went home for a break, and that later turned into the vet saying he should be put down. On to the next crack in my life. Only a few weeks before I was born my dad died I still dont have it in me to sit with my mum and have that conversation on how it happened, and although I dont feel sad about not having him as Im used to it since birth, I have heard things about fatherless kids not having as good lives although I am being co raised by my Aunty who is pretty much a 2nd mother except she can be giving the fatherly tough love some times. There has also been drama including my other Aunty doing drugs and making our life harder I will say I dont think it is intentional but her stupid choices are messing us all up. Theres heaps more I can talk about like my addiction to games even when Im not enjoying them and the recent passing of artist xxxtentacion I know hes a very controversial person but I really enjoyed his music and just seeing his face and hearing his messages to his fans.",
    "Is it all even worth it? Just to start it off, I DO NOT WANT TO KILL MYSELF. But recently Ive just been overwhelmed and I dont have anyone with whom I could share this. So basically before the winter breakweek ago everything was going great. I went on a friendly date with my crush that went well, my engineering contest was going great my biggest dream is to get into MIT and I am capable and school was fine. Fast forward to a few days ago when it all started going to shit. My crush left for a ski trip and gone cold, dont know if I did something wrong I have Aspergers and Im a typical stereotypical nerd, aka no dating skills, basically I dont pick up on the subtle hints at all or is it just the trip, I cant stop thinking about it and her, its very hard for me to find girls that I would call compatible, basically someone with a deep passion for something that basically defines them. That makes me distracted from my work which stresses me out even more. The contest Im taking part in is also kinda collapsing and Im very worried that Ill loose thousands of hours of CAD work and 500 in my currency 1500 that I invested into the project that I was promised back. Another team posted pictures that made me really anxious because of their complexity compared to the other teams and given their perfect score they might win. And the school part, my homeroom teacher that basically told me that he doesnt give a shit about me or my goals and that my reasons for joining this contest are wrong and that its all my fault that its gone to shit and that Im a tyrant who takes away all the work from my teammates which is totally false because they havent done a thing and basically dont care, anything I proposed I was told to do myself and most of the tasks of the other teammates also partially fell on me, like Hey can you help him with that? It got so bad that I had to get outside help which made my teacher even more mad so he started insulting me straight to my face, as well as behind my back, saying he doesnt want anything to do with me and basically disrespect my entire work and from my schoolmates tell me he is quite proud of it, it got to the point where my parent had to go and talk with the school.",

I think about peoples flaws and start judging them based on that. I develop a unnecessary hate towards them, gossip behind backs and more. I also feel like I dont really have any unique characteristics personality. Iam boring, I never have an own opinion, I just clinge to the opinions of those that I admire and plan on back stabbing them once im done with all the dick sucking. Iam just waste of flesh, i should have been aborted, and no iam not just in this mood at the moment, thats how I always feel, I realized it a long time ago but there is just not a cure for my hate jealousy and whatever sin from the Bible I embody. If God exists and if he truly punishes those who deserve it, than why am I not already dead. Also why cant I change, why was I born this way, why was I bullied so hard in high school, why am I gay, why could I never experience love till now? Just end me so that no one has to deal with me anymore.",
    "Making the same mistake years later. I knew she was back in town, later on I ended up at a house party where I got in to a very bad state with drugs and alcohol. And out of all the placed I could of met her again she walked in to the kitchen where I was dashing out lines of cocaine in a state where I could barely stand or speak. I tried telling her I wasnt the man I was when we first met, but of course she didnt believe it, why would she ? Somehow I managed to achieve some sort of success with her. We danced and kissed etc. But shes probably just lonely since coming back to town since most of her friends are gone away. We never had sex that night but I couldnt have sex even if I wanted to due to state I was in. I woke up next morning and all my feeling for her came back, all the love it took me years to forget, but I knew that it was over, it was just a one night thing. It crushed me. All these years breaking away from my habits wasted when it came down to a person it mattered. I was still the same lying drug addict in her eyes as I was 4 years ago. Its been a week and I feel empty, only emotion I have is constant hint of anger and sadness in me. I stopped eating or doing anything except working , I work 95 and then I go to my garage where I work on projects and drink alcohol until am I able to sleep. Maybe I am still the same scumbag I was 4 years ago. Iv been having suicidal thoughts but I know I cant do that since I need to look after my family. I would rather suffer myself then let my family suffer. At first I thought it was just a comedown from drugs since I havent touched them in so long. But I still miss her more and more everyday. I have dreams about her at night where we are happy together. I messaged her a few times but shes always busy and takes a long time to reply. Im just so lost, all these years to recover just to slip back into my old days when it mattered the most. She gave me an opportunity to fix what I once broke but instead I proceeded to ruin it further.",

I have been in a downward spiral for years and constantly in self destruct. I have victimised most people I care about and pushed everyone away and never let anyone get remotely close to me.

    "Depression after graduating university I graduated from university a few months ago and am in limbo back home with my parents. I am supposed to be applying for jobs but I feel completely paralysed with fear. I have always suffered from incredibly low selfesteem. My parents are really critical of me so I have started avoiding seeing them and just spending my time in my room alone. Friends are all busy with work and university. I feel incredibly low. I have not left the house in 11 days now and can barely muster up the energy to brush my teeth and shower each day. My days have no structure and I just eat junk food as I feel too lethargic to prepare proper meals for myself. Each day I wake up late 11amish and then count down the hours until 7pm when I can start getting ready for bed again. Getting into bed is perhaps the highlight of my day as it means another day of my life is over with. My mum just came in my room and told me I need to sort myself out. She finds it all pathetic and is angry at me. I get it. But that is not what I need. Can she not see that I am not well at the moment? I also have been suffering with anxiety. Everyday there is something new to worry about. Yesterday I thought I had breast cancer, a couple of weeks ago it was cervical cancer, etc. Even applying body lotion to my arms I am scared I am going to see a dodgy mole. I just feel so hopeless. But I get these brief moments of sadness when I think to what I was like this time last year. I was in university, surrounded by friends, top of my year, genuinely springing out of bed to go to university. I dont know how it went bad so quickly. I know I can turn it around. Sunday night I prepared a simple todo list to just look for jobs and identify three I wished to apply to. A simple task which breaks down the scary process of job hunting down to tiny steps but it is Wednesday and I still have not done that.",

    "I broke up wit my long distance fiance. Weve been dating for 2 years. Its our anniversary today. Hes in another country and he visited me once, a year and a half ago. He stayed for 2 weeks and weve only just been talking online after that. He has always had a problem of me having a different opinion from his. We have different views about things and I dont mind it, but it annoys him. He said I think hes stupid because I dont believe him. Believing him means agreeing with him. I held on because hes my first boyfriend and we didnt have any problem when he was here. He has good qualities and I chose to focus on those instead. However, we had a big fight today and I realized its gonna be hard living together if he cant even agree to disagree. Im so heartbroken. He has been my pillar for so long. I was in the dark before I met him. Now Im back in the dark. Ive been crying the whole day.",
    "Losing sense of care for self TW self harm. Hi all, Im struggling today with a really dark depression that began yesterday evening. I feel like its so hard to want to care for myself. As the TW suggests sometimes lately I have been so distressed and yet apathetic for myself that Ive scratched myself pretty badly. Its like I just think I might as well destroy myself, because I simply can. I know its bad to hurt me and if people see scars Ill be in even more trouble. So why dont I care? Do I think I deserve this? How do I care? Im never going to get better if I do bad stuff like this when Im feeling low.",
    "Just sadness Often times I just feel down and I have no clue why. Like I have friends and a supporting family but I barely talk to any of them when Im feeling down. Just an hour I talked to a friend i meet online and she told me to try new routines and try to change my mind set from everything right now is useless and nothing matters to something else she never told me. But the thing Is that I cant just change my mind set and that makes me even more sad because I tell myself I cant be better and almost everyone are better than me. But when I meet someone that isnt better than me I say bad things and push them away to make them feel worse. Also recently I find myself starring into nothing or a mirror and just thinking what would happen if I would die and who honestly would care. Also also when I think about this sort of stuff I dont cry or do anything physical like that I just get sad and keep thinking.",
    "Cutting Hello, Yesterday I cut myself, on my arm. Im wondering how it will heal? I feel terrible about it, and really dont want anyone to see my arm. But I cant hide it forever, and my girlfriend will see it eventually. I can hide it from other people, but not her. I just wanted to escape my thoughts but they have only turned worse as a result of what I did. Usually Ill just hit my knuckles into walls, until I physically cant do it anymore. But that heals faster, from what Ive heard this can take a while. ampx200B Sorry about the poor phrasing, Im Swedish. Thank you for reading.",

    "What should I try next? I have severe depression and anxiety. I am currently in a particularly bad episode. It is truly hellish and I can do very little. Between episodes I can be fairly high functioning, but I am finding that I am dilapidating more and more each year. Work and relationships are becoming increasingly impossible even during the good phases. I have tried psychotherapy ongoing still, CBT, DBT, citalopram, venlafaxine still in withdrawal, psilocybin therapy produced traumatising hell trips, diazepam, lorazepam, propranolol, zopiclone, exercise 5x per week, sleep, SAD lamps, meditation, good nutrition, prayer, selfharm, changing jobs, going back to education, selfhelp books, sauna, icebaths, living alone, living with friends, living with parents, float tanks, supplements and some other stuff. I have an ok job and live alone in an ok studio. Friends and family are generally supportive, although I have a poor, disconnected, awkward relationship with parents. No matter what, the good phases never feel that good and the horrifying, suicidal phases always keep returning. I think a lot of metacognition contributes a lot fear of what others are thinking about me especially partner and work colleagues, overthinking everything, regret and frustration about all these diseases are doing to me. If anyone has any ideas on what helps or maybe works for them, Id be interestedgrateful. I havent gone into a full description of my symptoms as dont want this to drag on too long, but am happy to answer any specific questions. Peace.",
    "I don’t want to take out my negative feelings on my bf Ive been struggling with depression, PTSD, anxiety, and anger issues for a while now, and I keep feeling down and I dont know how to not take out my anger at my bf by getting snappy with him or saying something kind of mean.

Covid ruined me and I used all my saving to survive until now, the only thing I didnt sell that I need is my phone.

    "I think my boyfriend left me due to his depression and I need some help to understand and deal with this situation. tldr at the bottom Although I have more than enough mental problems on my own, depression probably isnt one of them. But it is the problem of my now exboyfriend. He isnt someone who talks much and I really tried to talk to him but its hard to get any real information from him and although he seems to try to answer me, most times the answer is some variation of I dont know. So I thought Id ask you guys if anything in my story sounds relatable to you and if you have any idea about the situation of my ex and can maybe explain the things he cant Of course I know that you can just make guesses but Im trying really hard to understand him and Im just so confused. We both have our own problems but as a couple I wouldnt say we had any major problems. In the last months his depression got worse and I tried to support him but more often than not he prefers to be alone when hes feeling very bad and then I just try to give him enough space. Thats why were not as close as I would have liked but this slowly improved over time, so I was patient. We didnt see each other for a month due to badly timed holidays and when I came back, he broke up with me. His reasoning was something along the lines that he thinks Im feeling more for him than vice versa and that our relationship was more like a friendship. Which I think is true and at the same time isnt... Its definitely not just a friendship, but because I tried to not put any pressure on him and let things be more casual at times, we werent already there where I would like my relationship to be. That was two months ago. Were still texting each day and sometimes meet  were not having sex or kissing but still, he doesnt treat me just like a friend and it seems like he doesnt want to. Were officially broken up... but were not just friends.",
    "In those last days, my suicidal thoughts have strongly come back. Now I've found where my mother hides the knives. I've begun saying goodbye to people The title sums it up. Since an event that took place more than a week ago, on Sunday, Ive realized how messed up I was and how unable I was to socialize and be with people. Ive stopped talking about it to my family, because my father would shout at me again, my mother would joke about it and the others would judge me. Theyve badly educated me and gave me an unhealthy mindset. I hate my education and my familys lifestyle and morals. I despise what how they made me, and they cant listen when I ask for change. Im done being a weight. No matter what my friends say, I cannot see how Im not a burden. Im always bringing down the mood some have stopped talking to me about that and I dont bring anything. Im clingy and pathetic. If you look at my post history, youll see how even school tried to get rid of me because I depressed others. Its the physical manifestation of they would be better without me. Now, Ive stopped talking to people and Im about to end it. I see no other way, no one knows what to do with me. I have the means and Im ready to stop it. Im sorry to everyone who cared about me.",
    "I feel lonely even though there's no need to So I 25m gotta say that mostly my life is great  I have a lot of friends online amp offline and a lot of people like me for who I am which is very important for me. However  I have always been someone who was very lacking female contact. My whole life whenever I had female friends it was something very special to me and mostly those friendships were more important to me than to them. Always wanted to have a best female friend but after years where this wish never came true I gave up on it. At the moment I mainly have contact to two of my female friends. One is my ex girlfriend and we message each other occasionally. I know that shes very busy so naturally its rare for her to message me. But when we chat then its always very fun for both of us and we have a great time. And then nothing for like 1 or 2 months. I sometimes tell her how Im very happy when she messages me and stuff and then she always insists that its so rare because she has no time. So I can kinda cope with it. Then theres another online friend who I have known for roughly two and a half years now. We once were really close and even planned to meet up once but then quarantine hit and then the plan kinda fell into the water. Somehow the contact got less and less until it started again about a year ago. Mainly when its her or my birthday we keep saying how we should get into a voice call again and play some games like we used to. But then again when I ask her later she either says yeah we should do that soon or when she says I guess it could work out tonight she does not cancel it but at the same time I cannot reach her and the next day she says stuff like Sorry didnt work out. Im a very understanding person so I can easily accept that. However when you have planned something I think it should be your duty, if you post pone it, to message that person again and make a new plan. That doesnt happen. Last time she cancelled the plan nearly two weeks ago and I havent heard from her since.",

    "The days have nothing to offer for me: Looking for projects or hobbies to ease depression Hey girls and guys, Im suffering from depression and social anxiety since I was 15 years old. Today Im 21. My symptoms are mainly anhedonia disinterest and joylessness, lack of drive, motivation and ability to get stimulated, painful negative thoughts starting right in the morning when I open my eyes about past, present, future, that I dont have anything to offer, that Im disabled, that future life has nothing to offer for me etc., lethargy, low mood, sadness, cognitive restrictions memory, focus, access to knowledge and thoughts and irrational social anxiety. I wake up and see nothing that waits on me, nothing that I wait for or am up to or interested in, no drive or motivation to stand up, nothing that drives me anhedonia again. I then think what reasons or motives do other normal people see when waking up? I feel so empty about what the day has for me. Only thing I can see is food, maybe. Even food is no drive for me, I dont eat that much and dont feel the need to eat, I suffer from lack of appetite due to depression. Sure, I dont have much self worth or confidence at all. I dont have many things Im passionate about or Im good in. I see the connection no things youre passionate drive or good at feelings of success giving self worth gt depression. I still do things. I have a side job, not quite good in it. I study psychology, 5th semestre already, not quite good in it. As already mentioned my cognition turned incredibly bad, I always think Im dumb and unable to follow conversations, intellectual topics and such. Studying and university tasks or contents are very hard for me. I play tennis but rarely, quite good in it. I used to go to the gym, was boring but still quite good for distraction and feelings of success. I produce digital music, quite good in it and makes fun when I have a good day. I would love to play tennis and visit the gym more often but 1. they all contain socializing as there are people, so my social anxiety makes it incredibly hard for me and 2. now there is Corona.",

    "I'm begging someone for support rn. Anyone I was wholeheartedly convinced she was the woman I was going to marry. Eventually, after I had gone to jail, she decided to leave me and fucked 3 of my best friends... at the same time. It was complete betrayal, and thats when I realized I was truly alone. No friends, no family, it really fucked me up. Thats when my anxiety started to peak. The last few years of high school, I was addicted to cough syrup and would go to school tripping every single day. It destroyed my social skills, and fucked up my mind permanently. Eventually, after turning 21, I turned to alcohol. For the last 4 years, Ive drank basically everyday. Im at the point where I just hole up in my room, drinking around 18  20 drinks continuously everyday. Nothing is more terrifying than alcohol withdrawal. Ive gone to the hospital on numerous occasions for it, and every morning and night Im absolutely convinced Ill die of a heart attack. My 2nd gf I met 4 years ago. Finally, shed had it with my addiction and irrational behavior, and she left me. The thought of her being with another man crushes me, and Im at my lowest point. I cant stop drinking, havent showered in weeks. I have alcohol withdrawals constantly, and I cant even rid myself of the pain because when I start to drink again, its constant vomiting. I have nobody, and she was the only one that I had. Id call her at the end of everyday, and atleast I had someone to back me up. Ik its so cliche, but really she was my only hope. Im just really at the end, and just need someone to tell me it gets better. My life has been aweful since birth, and I just cant find hope. If you took the time to read this, I really appreciate it. I hope someone talks to me",
    "I need help with a routine so I have been battling depression since my teen years, but I have a good grip on it most of the time and take precaution. Due to recent events, I can feel my depression knocking at the door. I am actively searching therapy and medication. But I really need advice on a routine for me. I feel like this post is such a cry for help just screaming someone teach me how to be a functioning human lol but like. I just feel like because Im depressed I take so long getting ready in the mornings, I move so slow and have so many things to do. So sometimes I just avoid getting ready and its honestly gross. but ok do you guys workout and then get ready for the day? Or do you get fully ready and then be productive and then just wipe off makeup and go workout then go the rest of the night without makeup? Do you brush your teeth before or after coffee? Is wet hair more acceptable than greasy hair? I want to start wearing minimal make up because when I do take the full two hours to get ready and make breakfast I feel so beautiful. Ladies any recommendation on light face moisturizer or makeup?",
    "I’m not sure if it’s depression, I just see no point in living. This is my first post on Reddit and Im not really sure where else I can talk to. For the last 2 years or so Ive lived every day bored, and I mean bored as in bored of having no friends or people to talk to, bored of constantly feeling like shit and knowing Im causing the ones closest to me pain, bored of spending 40 minutes scared to leave the house because of how bad I look. Ive not seen a point in living for a long time now and people around me ask why Im so down or why I dont talk much and I just see no point, I know none of them care about me or care about the answer so whats the point in replying. Every night I go to bed I literally pray to god, even though I dont believe in him, that I die in my sleep as Im too scared to actually kill myself. I get so easily pissed off and pissed off at the fact I feel like this, I have so much more than most people and what most people could ask for and I just still feel like a constant shit bag always letting down others and as everyone around me says oh you have so much to do etc and youre only 17 none of it matters. I just hate every day as it goes on and theyre just all merging into one big day. I dont remember the last time I was genuinely excited about something or happy for something that I wasnt forcing myself to feel. I just want to be happy, its all I want. What can I do when there seems to be nothing that can make me happier.",

    "Looking for success stories from adults who have been depressed most of their lives Hey. So, Im 26 years old and really struggling at this moment. Ive struggled since I was probably 4 or 5 at the latest, maybe even earlier than that, due to extreme isolationneglect. I first tried to kill myself when I was about 5 or 6 years old. Ive lived a very lonely life riddled with abuse, poverty, extreme trauma, and negligence. Theres not many bright spots. I have PTSD, depressionanxiety, likely ADHD and who knows what else. I recently stopped medicating with marijuana, which I used for over 10 years. Its brought up a lot of these shitty past feelings and reminded me why I needed to escape. Ive been in therapy with several handfuls of different therapists, tried several medications, and I do all of the usual shit like yoga, daily exercise, good sleepdiet etc. but Im still completely miserable no matter how much I try to put a positive spin on things. Ive given myself until Im 30 years old to feel some sense of normalcy or contentment, or else I am going to end my life, because I cant continue on like this. I feel like that should be more than enough time to see if I have a shot at a decent life or not. Has anyone else been this deep in the hole, and managed to get themselves out for more than just short periods at a time? I know life is full of ups and downs, but Im tired of suffering 360365 days out of the year this might even be being generous. Im really hoping someone out there has a similar background and has made a better life for themselves. Id love to hear about it, in face I kind of need it right now. In case it helps you help me to know this, I feel that I still suffer a lot from loneliness I cant own pets due to rent restrictions and I have trouble making friends despite constant efforts, and I have a lot of anxietypessimism around the state of the world, mostly environmentaleconomical. I think these are the big things holding me back, but theres probably more. Cheers, looking forward to hearing some hopefully positive stories.",
    "Soon to be dad and I’m struggling to cope So Ive written posts about this before but heres the basics. My pregnant girlfriend split up with me. She said she dident love me anymore. I lost my temper and said some things I shouldnt have which I admit was my fault. We dident talk or have any contact for 6 weeks I drunk heavily during this time and my depression was unbearable. I eventually reached out and apologised and explained I wanted to be there for the baby. She agrees I meet her for the first time since we broke up and she makes it clear she never wants to get back together and just wants to be friends. So since then Ive cut right back on my drinking intact I dont drink anymore. As the son of a alcoholic looser father I dont want that for my child I want to be a good dad. Anyway every time I talk to her it feels like a kick in the teeth. So I actively avoid messaging her and only respond to her when she messages me cause of all the pain it brings up. The only thing keeping me going is the baby. But its been 10 weeks since we broke up and I still feel just as broken and miserable inside. I dont have any friends I sit on my PlayStation all day just trying to zone out and focus on something other than how miserable I am. I thought that when I stopped drinking I would feel better and to be honest I dont I still feel like shit. I have a therapist whos helpful and a support worker to help me not go back to drinking.

    "I'm losing my mind and need help. I contemplate suicide everyday. I don't see any future anymore, just think I'll kill myself one of these days. I need help. 17 year old male, 18 beginning of July. Ive been struggling with my mental health for all of my life, and it got worse after starting puberty. Ive always been terrible with social groups and interactions. Never managed to make a lot of friends, and those I did never sticked. Had some of your regular trauma from parents and older brother. Ive always felt alone. When I became a teenager I started with the depression. Got very bad episodes, where I would shut down, and fake illness so I could stay home. I missed one month of school once, and on a trip to Italy for school I faked illness for two weeks so I could stay in bed, and could only think about jumping off a bridge. As I got deeper into adolescence not only did my mental health deteriorate, but my ability too. My memory became poor, and my focus was gone, always having mental fog. I couldnt remember words, and speak eloquently. Math ability went to the shitter, always making stupid mistakes that would then seem retarded later. My IQ seemed to have dropped as much as 10 points, since I have periodically been applied tests and only perform worse. Starting high school made me much more suicidal because of this, and the isolation of not knowing anyone, and the people I did know wouldnt even look me in the eyes. I had already gone to a psychologist, and after that a neurologist, and recently a therapist. Got medication, and have been on it since 2017. The doctor has changed my meds more times than I can count, and none of them have helped. She told me that I would probably never be off of meds, but they still dont help me. I have no cure. I feel I have been slowly getting worse, going down my own dark little hole. Ive always been obsessive, but now it feels like its all I am. I feel like Im losing my mind. Everything makes me irritated, or break down.",
    "Girlfriend left me and now I'm terrified my depression/anxiety will overwhelm me Hello, Today my girlfriend decided we will no longer be together. Or I dont even know how to put it. Throughout our relationship I believe my anxiety made me insecure and at times it got to the point where I would tell her that I dont think I want to be in a relationship with her. To me they were always empty words in what Im now thinking was a cry out for help but seeing it through her eyes, why wouldnt she believe me, and why wouldnt this effect her. It would have a terrible effect on me. And about a week ago I said it again, and that was the last straw for her. So here I am, alone. Ive never really had many friends and never reached out to make some because she was my best friend. Ive battled anxiety and depression for a while now but dont know how to cope with what has happened. While I have talked to a psychologist before this girl was the only one who I truly felt free speaking with and has helped me tremendously through the years. My anxiety has a bad effect on my body and Im so scared Im going to throw away my new job that I love, and the great opportunities I have because I just cant bother to get up and go out the door. I dont know what to do. I just want the girl Ive loved for so long.",
    "My mother and I had an unsettling conversation in the midst of my depression, and I don't know how to feel... Okay, so I am teen 14M who is dealing with a lot of struggles. I have had depression for months, and I dont know what to do. I live in a smal part of a big town, which means I dont see many friends often, and Im the only one my age in that part of town. Thats bad from a start, but thats not whats triggering me... I had been dealing with my dumbass psycho ex, not able to see my gf, being bullied and cyberbullied. I have beaten myself until I bled, every day in the past 2 weeks, and I always wonder if life is worth living, and yet I still try to piece things together again. Yesterday, I had figured out that my past was a lot worse than I had originally thought, with reoccurring memories of childhood trauma. We were having a normal conversation about how I was doing at school as usual, but it took a turn quickly back to the worst childhood memories I had, which all I had forgotten until then. I had thought it was always peaceful back then since almost every childhood memory I had before then was happy. I even bring up these positive memories whenever Im down. And these memories came back. Heres what they were one by one in the order they happened The first memory, the only one I couldnt regain my perception on was one from when I was in preschool obviously. The last day I went to preschool, my mother was watching in the preschool because she noticed things werent perfectly fine there. Before it was over, a little girl who was 3 years of age, opened one of the metal doors and accidentally slammed her fingers in the doors. The tips of 3 of that girls fingers were cut off from that door and was bleeding everywhere. The staff was panicking, but they werent doing anything. They didnt call for help. They just stood and watched. The staff, also, were both 17 yearolds watching over 32 preschool kids which was illegal. My mother quickly took me out of that daycare and felt so bad for leaving me there.",
    "Loneliness, sinking down, and... I am extremely depressed now. This depression sinks me to the bottom today. I am so desperate. If someone in the DFW area reads my post, please DM me. While I was scrolling down my contacts, I found that no one I can contact and ask to meet with me tonight. Those who I have trusted and befriended... I could not call them. I thought that they would laugh or scoff at me. When I was a teenager, I had the protection, socalled parents. However, I feel that I am alone in this world. One night, I called one of my sisters and poured out my emotion. Since I trusted her so much, I told her everything. However, she ignored me and said, Hey, bro, I am so busy with my life. And do not complain about your life. Also, my life is so tough! So could you not throw away your emotion to me? I am not your trash bin! Often, I relied on the counseling service. But, I found that Counseling does not help but exacerbate my depression. The problem of professional counseling is... the counselors have their own frame. And also, at this point, I do not have enough money to receive more counseling services. So, I dont ask for any money but emotional support at this point. I feel that my emotion is collapsing and sinking to the bottom of the abyss.",
    "Suicidal Thoughts I think about killing myself every week. Every time I do, I feel like Im inching more and more toward the day Id actually do it, like Im on a train speeding toward a cliff and theres nothing I can do to stop it. I compose the letters Id leave behind bit by bit in my head. Brother, youre the firstborn son our parents shouldve had, and youll do a much better job at it than I have. I love you and Im truly sorry for everything. Sister, I love you too and Im sorry for everything. Dad, I know you only wanted to do good. I know you wanted the best for us. I know you tried. Im sorry I couldnt be the son you wanted to have. And Im sorry for destroying your marriage. Pray for me. As to my mother, I couldnt even begin to think of the words Id leave behind for her. She deserves more. She deserves more than she ever had. I know I shouldnt be feeling this way and thinking like this but Im a burden, a bug in the matrix and they will all be better off without me. I came to a happy family and I ruined everything. I feel irrevocably, irreconcilably lost. I dont fit anywhere, I dont belong with anyone and wherever I take refuge Im eventually discovered to be the anomaly I am. My brain bullies me, my dad lost hope on me and I feel like an injured kid that has fallen into a well and is crying for help. Im aware Im looking for sympathy here and that makes my squirm into myself and want to disappear. Any torch of hope is much appreciated. Thank you for reading.",
    "I’m 23, highly anxious, depressed, raised by a narcissist/alcoholic, and need a job. I have no clue what to do with myself. Until Covid I worked in retailrestaurants my whole life as I am extremely personable, albeit an introvert. Now with covid, I very much so do not trust Americans wholeheartedly, Im getting the vaccine but everything is opening up at 100 no restrictions near me, which just makes no sense to me. Poor behavior amongst people these days, retail workers are the frontline of managing Covid and policies these days, for little pay. Now I dont even want these jobs as Ive not been social for over a year now. I did not go to college as I have learning disabilities. I also have awful fine motor skills, likely due to growing up anxious a lot due to alcohol in the house. Father has NEVER been abusive physically or frankly intentionally abusive, theyve never processed any emotions so theyre a mess. Still live with them and constantly triggered by it. I also am sorta addicted to weed, as I believe I have PTSD at this point so I truly feel its a need not a want at this point which is frustrating. I could go on and on lol, so, help? Im truly getting to the point it feels things just aint gonna work out for me, whole life has been out of my control. I was adopted, controlled by helicopter and anxious parents, now my anxiety runs my life, nothing is in my control or works out for me it seems.

Since been a teenager all her morals have changed she swears is disrespectful tells her friends lies that we are awful parents she scams family and friends for money so she doesnt have to get a job. She rarely calls only if she wants something. She never even contacts he brother or sister. She is addicted to her phone.

    "I want to slit my wrists but I know the consequences. So basically at the beginning of the year I started slitting my wrist because I started feeling overwhelming depression after 2019. My mum saw the marks and told me to stop. At the beginning of quarantine my depression took another increase, and for two days I started slitting my wrist again until my mum saw. She demanded that I tell her what was wrong, and I just told her I feel generally depressed all the reasoning behind it is complicated and plus I dont feel comfortable telling her. She asked me if a boyfriend had broken up with me or something, and that definitely wasnt the reason so I assume if she knows Im depressed shell think that. She then demanded that I dont slit my wrists again, and therefore I know that if I do, Ill get into a bunch of crap I dont wanna be in. I really wanna start doing it again Im a horrible person so I deserve it and hurting myself makes me feel better for some reason. Ive always felt guilt and shame, and self hatred, and I feel like my life has reached the end of the line I feel true happiness has faded, and the realisation has struck, that life is completely worthless and I will die one day, leaving everything behind. All motivation seems gone, and my life has just gone to shit, comparing it to the past. I really want to slit my wrist, but I know my parents would see. So what do I do? How do I cut myself and get away with it? Can I cover it up without raising suspicion? I really want to. I feel desperate, but I know I cant.",
    "Ugly people, how do y'all deal with it? So Im pretty ugly tbh, I would rate myself as a 34, body wise I have a nice body, starting to lose it though because I havent worked out in a couple months, but even though I have a nice body, my face is full of acne scars and Im going bald and Im not even 25 yet. Sometimes I dont even want to go outside because I feel like Im too ugly, but thats honestly only when Im feeling down. The biggest problem for me is finding affection, I understand that Im not attractive, so I dont expect the girl to be that pretty, but honestly I dont get any form of affection, and the little attention I get is from girls who are not even slightly attractive I know talking like this, makes it seem like Im a horrible person, but honestly idk how else to say it. Honestly, my mom is the only person that shows me any kind of affection, and it makes me just want to be at home all the time, even though I have friends, they are not really people who I can depend on. Sometimes I just want to start getting escorts or something to spend my time with, but I know Ill feel even more depressed if I go down that route.",

    "When is it enough? F26 I am a person having my own struggles with depression and anxiety and lately panic attacks. After having read so many stuff online about all these things trying to understand them and unscrew myself, i still feel like im standing at a dead end. Im in the peak years of my life, i should be working on myself. I should be living the life, making friends, having good days and nights. Thats the reason i moved to another country in the end, to make a better life for myself, not drown in self pitty and sorrow. But the lack of motivation and fear of repeating mistakes from the past is paralyzing and thinking leaves me with barely enough energy to get out of bed and drag myself to work. How does this happen, it was never this severe. Thinking about seeking professional help makes me even more anxious because of the language barriere. I cant concentrate at work or even try to be friendly with my coworkers and i know how it looks, i made almost zero friends in a year since im here and i dont like myself as a person or my actions. I am acting completely irrational and i feel like theres no one to talk to. How do you break this toxic circle?",

    "I'm so tired Thats when the topic of school opening came up, there was a virtual and hybrid option, I wanted to stay home and they were dead set on getting me back in. That led to a lot of usually hour long arguments with my mom where we went in complete circles, I was just scared and worried for my familys health, but eventually I was sent in to school. Around this time my Grandma passed away, it came out of nowhere and added to the confusion of it all. Ive always been accepting of death and everything, but it still hurt a lot to go through. I missed her, and I just had no idea what was going on anymore. I also struggled with intrusive thoughts a lot, something that continues even now. They went from anything as random as questioning my gender to recurring thoughts of suicide, I had absolutely no control of them but them just being there constantly drained a lot out of me. School was rough, none of my friends were in person, meeting new people was really hard with no after school stuff, and teachers clearly werent having an easy time adjusting to teaching this way. Motivation was hard again, I tried drawing and going outside as much as possible just so I could do something at least, but I didnt feel better. Being at school was just a constant reminder of what position we were all in, I just missed having a normal uneventful year of school at this point. Eventually cases started rising again and I wanted to switch to virtual school again, so yet again I fought with my parents about it every other day. School was miserable, no one was there anymore, no one I knew and none of the familiar faces I didnt, I just wanted to be with my friends at home at least then I could talk to them in class. My memories are fuzzy here but I remember a really bad spiral. I ran out of therapy appointments, it didnt really help anyways and my therapist never really gave me any methods to feel better instead of just trying to do things more.",
    "I’ve lost track of my life and I don’t know how to get it back RANTREQUESTING SUPPORT OR ADVICE Ive 24F been struggling with depression off and on for the past 6 years. My mood was getting better since I broke up with my exboyfriend a month ago, but recently I feel like Ive lost track of my life completely. The breakup was the fist time I choose my own needs above someone elses and it felt like a step towards freedom. Meanwhile Im kinda dating somebody I have an extremely strong connection with. Weve had a short but intense relationship in the past but lost connection. We started talking again right before I finally decided to breakup with my ex Ive considered it many times but never had the courage to actually do it. I strongly believe that talking to this person made me decide to breakup with my ex. Besides that it really feelsfelt like the universe wanted us to connect again in a romantic way. Weve been dating for the past 2,5 weeks and Ive never been this confused in my life. One day I feel so liberated, loved, happy and absolutely in love with the person Im dating. The next day Im full of guilt, confused about my feelings for my ex and extremely depressed again. Guilt because I feel like Ive done my ex wrong while I know I didnt. Our relationship was not equal and mainly based on me taking care of him financially and emotionally. I feel like I abandoned him and I hate myself for that. Confused because I miss him so much and still feel love for him and the person Im currently dating, both in a romantic way. Depressed because I dont know how to deal with these feelings and because I think I messed up again. I feel like my life is a constant pattern of failure and making bad decisions unconsciously. Im stuck and lost. I keep telling myself that the most important thing is to be happy on your own, that you dont need a significant other to be happy. I know I tend to start difficult and ambiguous relationships in order to avoid other complicated feelings I actually have to deal with like a breakup. Im very aware of my coping but at the same time I feel like I genuinely need to experience if a relationship with the person Im dating will work out or not.",
    "I could use some help figuring out if there‘s a possibility I‘m suffering from depression The thing that makes all this so hard to decipher for me is that Im never certain how I feel. I know it sounds stupid but its the best I can describe it. I have some good days where I just hang out with friends in discord and play minecraft all day but theres always that thought in the back of my mind that I dont deserve this. In contrast to that I also have bad days where I feel like Im on the edge of breaking down and giving up on everything. One of the most common feelings I have is hate towards myself. Now the part that every aRe yOU dePResSed? taKE THiS qUiz! website asks Have I thought of suicide? More or less. Ill be as honest as possible in this part. I have thought about if I would survive the distance from the window to the ground outside. I have thought about if it would hurt very much to stab myself. I was never actually anywhere close to doing it. I have also thought about if Im important to my friends or if theyre just with me out of pity. I have thought about if the world would be any different without me in it. So, I have some suspicions that I COULD be depressed. But I also think its possible that im just imagining things because Im just awful. If anyone made it through this, thank you for your time. If anyone wants to spend their time giving me advice i would be grateful. M",

Challenges I hate that, I envy my friends, always ready to take on new challenges, being the best version of their self and then they reap the rewards of taking the risk, the opposite happens when I face new challenges, panic attack, complaining, whining and thinking negative constantly. My friends are earning near six digits yet me is stuggling to get by on my meager income, most of the time thinking I might get fired on every messed up I did on the office. I always wanna learn to code so I may better my chance of earning more or atleast a self fulling hobby, when theres an opportunity or time to learn I always hesitate on starting maybe because Im scared like a kid who is afraid of math. Coding is painful especially the debugging part but it is very fulfilling once everything run. When I was a kid I love to draw but my parents enrolled me on a engineering course focusing on IT, so there goes my hobby slowly getting forgotten. I envy my friends in college who are quite into technical stuff, I do love tinkering but when it comes to tinkering something about school there goes me, avoiding it or procrastinating on studying. I know a bit of coding stuff but Im not that good on analyzing instruction, algorithm, pseudocode etc. I struggled at school but manage to graduate with not so good grades average, just passing. So theres that my opportunity getting hired is not so good but still manage to get a job Im thankful they still havent fired me at the office, even tho Im the dumbest, cringiest, lowest confidence employee, slow on getting instruction and full of typos on my email and bad at presentationreport I wanna conquer my fear but anxiety is messing up with me. Then depression sets in reminding me Im a failure at everything I do, anxiety letting me think Im hated by everyone and everything would go south.

I posted on an expat subreddit for the country Ive moved to on a different account with a question I had, because I honestly had no idea where else to ask it. I tried so hard to phrase the question in the best, clearest, most polite way possible, because I was worried about being a burden. There were a few people who answered my question and were helpful but it got downvoted a lot, because someone reposted my post on a different subreddit made for making fun of people. And the repost got so many upvotes. It had people in the comments calling me retarded, and a fuckwit and stupid and just generally shitting on me. I wish I never posted anything, Im probably going to regret posting this as well. Im so completely crushed. Ive never been bullied this badly before. I dont trust anyone anymore.

No matter from where you are and which century you got born in, problems such as depression doesnt leave the world, everyone can get depression depending on the situation that they are having. My Iraqi parents went through alot when they were in Iraq, they went through tough wars and time where they dont have food or water. They moved out of the country to Dubai, where I got born and raised in. We all know that depression can cause people to suicide, but my parents had another thoughts.

My dad is an animal guy, so he doesnt mind at all. But my mom has allergy and asthma, so convincing her is pretty hard. Today, I told my mom i had depression, and if adopt a cat it would help me alot to avoid the same senario. Instead of asking why I had depression and what caused it, she decided to say smth rude, which was You getting depression because of school pressure and you wanting a cat is all a girl thing, dont be a girl and man up At that moment I felt that smth pinched my heart and I just wanted to leave the house to somewhere else, she made me feel as if my problem didnt exist and i was faking it just to get a cat, i was soo offended and now im scared that ill get depressed again.

They eventually texted back to express their gratitude but I did not hear from them afterwards... So again, she had her bouts of episode and meltdowns and I had to calm her down every single time. it gets exhausting for me as well. And I always feel that I am trying to fight against absorbing and feeling down from all of these. Recently, she went for a staycay and her mum called me. She was begging me to ask my friend to cancel it to which i have no influence on at all since my friend was really optimistic about this she initially had plans to kill herself during this trip but after meeting another psychologist, she kind of is delayin it. When her mum called me a second time, i was with my friend and my friend was really on the edge. She tried taking my phone away from me to talk to her mother but I stopped her. Her mum SAID thru the phone since i didnt know she is with you and you are still going to allow her to go for the staycay, ALL is on you. YOU SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY IF SMTG HAPPENS TO HER. I DONT CARE but you make sure she is safe. I was quite upset by this but politely ended the call as my friend tried grabbing the phone away from me. Ended up, she called her mum back only to shout and scream at her mum  berating the mum for calling me. Her mum was upset. The mum texted me and blamed me for my friends action. I replied to her saying I was sorry that that happened and that I tried calming my friend but she went hysteria instead. The mum later replied telling me that since my friend does not listen to her as a mother, i should be the one doing the advice and guiding my friend to the so called right path. She said that she leave me to take care of my friend for her. Im speechless guys.. I am so exhausted already but yet this happened??",

    "Wife wants space to fight depression I have made the conscious decision to fight with every strand of my being to save this marriage and I will not be the one that ends it. Things have been fairly positive, we have met up at least once a week for walkscoming over for dinner etc etc. But its all very friendly, but I do say that I love her every now and then. She wants to take things one step at a time and she is open to marriage counselling, if the mental health counselling doesnt work out. I think deep down she still loves me even though she doesnt say it or that she misses me but does slip in the odd soppy nickname here and there. Might be just a habit, I dont know. She still clearly cares about me because the other day she barged into the house after my phone wasnt receiving sending calls or texts and I didnt let her know I was safe at home. She also does other things like picks things off me like the odd scab and blackhead here and there, cut my hair and hugs me in a meaningful manner. I feel like I may be rambling a bit here, I want to feel positive about things but I am really struggling. I am putting a brave face on for her so she has less pressure, but anytime we part ways I sob uncontrollably for hours because i just love her so much and want her to come home. Has anyone else gone through something similar with their spouse? Any tips? Ive been extremely self critical and I can see there are improvements I can make to make the relationship better. Especially now we have more financial freedom. But with lockdown still in force, it makes things 10x more difficult. TLDR My wife wants space to find out what she wants.

I read that the withdrawal takes about a month to go away. I am scared, I am lost. I am in New York and all of the places for help have really long waiting lists.

    "My depressed partner drains me tldr My partner has been depressed and not knowing what to do with his life for a long time. I am the only person he relys on for support and I cant bear it any longer. It starts to severely affect my own life quality and happiness. I 30f met my partner 32m at university eight years ago. He was a very fun, open and active guy with a huge social group. After two years of being friends we started dating. It was around that time that he was done with all his courses and papers and the only thing left for him to finish uni was to write his bachelors thesis. That didnt happen for another four years. Within that time he basically didnt do anything. Didnt write his thesis, didnt get a job. He told me, that he had no clue, what he wants to do with his life and I tried to encourage him to just do some internships to figure that out, but he never did. He is fortunate enough that his parents pay for his expenses always did and still do, so money wouldnt be the problem. He never did any internship. Fast forward six years and the situation is still the same. He did eventually finish his bachelors and started a masters degree but realized that studying just isnt for him. However he still isnt properly searching for jobs or internships or general input that would help him figure out, what he wants to do or be. The thing is, that his self esteem is lower than the mariana trench. He feels like he doenst know anything and is underqualified for basically every job. Hes not. Hes incredibly smart, attentive and detail orientated and has a great passion for social justice but he keeps telling himself that he isnt enough for any job and he doenst dare to apply. I dont know how to help him. All my affirmations seem to not penetrate his mindfog. However, the problem is that Im the only one hes talking to. Because he realized that all his peers moved on he stopped having contact with them because he was embarassed. So here is the thing.",
    "Someone is telling me they are going to kill their self and I don't know what to do. On Facebook, This person began to message me. I do not know who they are in person. They began telling me about how they hate their life. I tried to be empathetic. Then, they began to inform me the date they are going to kill their self. I tried hard to inform this person how people will miss them and that they have a reason to live for their god children. They refused and still told me they are going to do it.

The chatter is all inside my head, and it never stops. ampx200B I feel like sometimes I am already dead on the inside, and Im not really human. Just a shell o what I wanted to be.

Ive had one relationship with a girl, that eventually ended. I loved her but after that I couldnt feel anything for anyone and no, not even her. I just ended up obsessing over her, even if I didnt feel a thing. Really tried after I started to get over her, and even tried with another girl, but even with all that I managed to bosses with her as well, and got called a creep and that I harassed her.

    "I need help While in the bootcamp, we rarely talked, living our separate lives. After I graduated bootcamp I moved to Washington State, to gain some world experience and she did the same thing, but interning in the Caribbean as a marine biology instructor. I started at this time having extremely unhealthy night terrors. I was still madly in love with her, I had a ring in mind from our first relationship and one night was exceedingly bad. The next morning I told myself that I would reach out to her, tell her the truth of what I was feeling. So I did. I told her about how much I missed her, my night terrors, why we separated and my insecurities about how she was feeling at the time. And I told her that I still loved her and either needed her in my life or I had to completely cut her out because my mental health was really bad. These night terrors are demons like no other. I hop no one has to be afraid to sleep because they may experience watching and hearing their ex get railed by guy after guy. It truly is a haunting experience. After I reached out she told me she had missed me, and felt the same. We talked about what things would be different and how we would be able to go on from there. She had 2 months left in her internship before she came back to the states. During this time we talked about the future, where she wanted to work, when we could see each other again, things we could do etc etc... The reason it was difficult is because I landed a job as a software developer in idaho that only pays 52yr. So plane tickets from Kentucky arent the cheapest. I also got us a hotel room and tickets to see one of our favorite bands tame impala. Well. When the day finally came where she returned to the states something happened. She did a complete 180 and told me she no longer wanted a relationship and wanted to be independent to travel the world and teach Marine biology. I was always supportive of this idea but the way she described it to me seemed that instead of a partner, I was more of an obstacle. And she eventually ended the relationship. I was hurt, really really bad.",

    "Husband triggered depression by sitting on bed with daughter So my father and I have had some innapropriate interactions over the years. Based on this and working in a field that is very aware of the high frequency of sexual abuse, I have tried really hard to raise my daughter with some modesty boundries to help protect her from grooming by predators. She is 14. At this age I have discussed this many times with my husband away from our daughter. He often gets what I would describe as vey chummy with her. Sitting very close, to do things, resting his arm on her leg and his voice changes pitch like he is playfully flirting and will even bat his eyes at her. I have repeatedly told him how uncomfortable it makes me and how the same behavior from my dad has really bothered me all these years and how horable it is to put a kid in a position to have to tell her father to give her space. Also it really triggers my depression. But, I would say the behavior has not stopped in any frequency. I am in a very bad bout of depression now. I started crying and tried to go to bed. But, they were on the bed looking at old photos. I walked out and walked back in to non verbaly hint that something was wrong. My husband acknowledged the look, but went back to what he was doing. I said I had to go to bed, it was very late. My hasband took our daughter and left, but I was so upset, I asked our daughter to please go to bed, it was getting pretty late. I did this because I wanted to talk privately with my husband about the issue. He exploded and says I am just poisoning my daughter against him. No concern about my depression or grooming concerns, just pure anger. He said he talked to his friends and everyone thinks I am trying to turn our daughter against him, based on this event.",

    "I don't have anything, no future and just.. yeah. I dont know where to start so I guess I give my life story. My father left me as a baby, and my mother lost custody at some point. Therefore, my grandparents had gain custody of me. For the most part, my early childhood was normal until around a certain age I was molested by an older female family member that had also extended to one of my female neighbour doing the same thing. At the time, I did not understand this or knew anything, but they as did. This didnt impact me at first, I was too young to understand, but as I got older I was lashing out a lot more, mainly to the female gender. At first, I didnt realize this, and Ive never told anyone what happened either. I felt ashamed, scared I get in trouble and no one would believe me. ampx200B As years went on, I grew to be more of an oddball person, an outcast among my peers. I did not get along with the female gender, and I didnt care until I hit puberty. Around this time, Im still super awkward and bully by everyone. I didnt have many friends, maybe 23 and this stayed until high school. Up until this point, never had a girlfriend and didnt know how to approach any girl for it. My selfconfidence is long shot with abandonment issues. Most of my family thinks Im gay and Im still bullied. ampx200B Additionally, to all of this, I have developed depression. As a teenager, I look around and see people hooking up but not this guy. At home, I had several relatives just killing my confidence, saying I was gay saying I would never amount to anything and so on. I also have , and my family stopped getting medication for it. So now, even at school, Im struggling, staying in one spot in subjects Im not a huge fan? Yeah, it was not great, and I ended up skipping a lot. To this day, I cant ever get any medication for it either, but I save that little later.",

    "I need help…. Im really struggling today. My normal coping techniques getting outside, watching a favorite show, etc arent working. Weekends are always tough for me. But its now October and my late Moms birthday is in two weeks. I was her caregiver. She wouldve been 65. Qualifying for Medicare and we couldve gotten so much more help for her paraplegia. And since she was a teacher i.e. state worker she didnt qualify for disability or other help. Thanks for nothing for her 25 years of service huh? Regardless, its bothering me more as this is the year her life wouldve gotten easier and mine and shes not here to enjoy that. I wouldve been helping her with her new paperwork, enjoying the research, etc. Add on to that, I took a new job in April, and while good, its a big change. I then lost my dog which was Moms as well in June so Im now alone. Im single as my caregiving responsibilities didnt give me a lot of dating time or opportunity. Nothing much excites me anymore. My music has fallen to the wayside. I cant enjoy playing a video game. And trying to lose weight for health during all this is just added stress. Ive never been a quitter, pretty ambitious guy. Not anymore. It took a year to get past my Moms death. But now losing our dog is like losing her all over again. Add in pandemic stress on that and there you have it. Ive had some really dark times here as of late. Just need to talk and some nonjudgmental help.",
    "Questions about taking Wellbutrin XL 150 mg, about 72 hours before I start In 48 to 72 hours, I will begin taking Wellbutrin XL 150 mg once a day, which will be my first time taking a pharmaceutical medicine for anxiety and depression, after my twelvestep program sponsor encouraged me to do so, and after my mother  a psychiatric nurse encouraged me to do so. I have a robust support system, and for over seven years, I have regularly engaged in a myriad of modalities to address anxiety, depression, and hopelessness, and a pattern of burnout, including but not limited to cognitive behavioral therapy, two twelvestep programs, different forms of meditation, various mindfulness practices, hatha yoga, bhakti yoga, weightlifting, highintensity interval training, longdistance running, reading books on personal development and introspection, different forms of journaling, a myriad of support groups, numerous supplements, psychedelics, etc. As one of my hatha yoga instructors has stated, I do all the things. I have chosen to take Wellbutrin XL 150 mg for many reasons. It seems to have minimal side effects in most people based on my research and conversations with my psychiatrist and other doctors, it does not lead to some of the side effects that I am most concerned about, like weight gain, and it seems to be a manageable introduction to psychiatric medicine. Moreover, all of the previouslymentioned modalities have changed my life for the better since 2014. Still, a destructive and potentially lifethreatening pattern comes up in my life, time and time again, and my psychiatrist, my mother, and others believe that Wellbutrin XL 150 mg may help.",

    "I can’t feel anything, no matter what I do, I can’t feel anything physically or mentally I am a 17 yo male, who comes from an extremely abusive household, and Ive recently noticed that my feelings are almost non existent. I also cant feel any pain, some might think its a gift but its a fucking curse. Im numb to the core and I just want to be normal again. I havent eaten in 3 days because if I try to I throw up. Ive been getting 4 hours of sleep regularly and cant physically sleep longer than that. My father used to beat me and force me to torture rodents with him. I remember one time he made me drown a possum in a garbage can and hack a squirrels limbs off. By the time I was 8 years old I had already known how to disassemble, clean, and reassemble a .38 caliber pistol. My father was a narcissist, and I was his golden child. If I ever did anything wrong I was told I was making our family look bad. Id get a hell of a beating if I even said anything out of line, and my mother was constantly in and out of hospitals from her accidents. I believe my father is a large part of why I am feeling the way I am recently. I noticed I stopped feeling emotion when I had a stroke last March. I wasnt scared, or worried, I was calm, and didnt even feel anything. Even after I had almost lost my ability to play guitar, I wasnt sad or scared. Ever since then, its just gotten worse and worse. My girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me and all I had to say to her was ok. Honestly it was probably best for her, I dont know if I can feel love anymore, so whats the point of trying. I recently noticed I cant physically feel pain when I was trying to fix the shingles on my roof. I missed with the hammer and smacked my hand right on the thumb, but I didnt feel anything. Just to test my theory, I smacked the back of my hand full force. I heard the crunching of bone, but still felt no pain. I dont know whats wrong with me.",

    "Should I kill myself? I am the most uninteresting person and I feel like I am the only one who puts effort into any of my relationships. But when we broke up, they were there for me. Though I hated myself for opening up to them, showing the weak side of myself, showing my insecurity, and once again depending on others for emotional stability is so unhealthy and unattractive. I cried infront of them, I told them about how I suffered with suicidal thoughts, I told them about my past and what I went through and they listened to me. I am grateful for that but I never should of told them a thing. 2020 happened and I began isolating myself, I attempted suicide once at the start. I tried reaching out to Angela, I didnt want to tell any of them about my issues any more but I wanted to distract myself and have someone to chat to. No response, the lack of effort I put in my friends finally came to haunt me. Once I got over my ex in march 2020, no one wanted to talk to me anymore. We werent able to see eachother at school and I didnt build that relationship where we can just text. We werent able to hangout so the friendships sort of rotted. I thought I was hopeless, friendless, and losing more prospects for the future. I dont have connections to be successful. I have nothing. So I though why not end it. I took a bunch of pills but I just ended up blacking out and puking a bunch. I remember the feeling of blacking out but I could still hear the voice of people freaking out as I was fading. I lost vision and feeling but I could still hear. I thought I was dead. But no I wasnt, I started therapy regularly. I was so hopeless and didnt know how to make friends but I kept pushing through. I tried reaching out a few times and sometimes they said hi back. I ended up hanging out with Angela once restrictions lifted a bit in the summer. But after that we struggled to talk again. My other 2 friends ended up dating and stopped talking to most people becsuse of that.",

    "I'm scared I might be a danger Currently, Im medically diagnosed with moderate to severe depression and anxiety, and my therapist has told me its highly likely Im currently suffering from PTSD. The problem is, I want to hurt people. I hate my family for everything theyve done, how theyve treated eachother, and how angry they are towards eachother. They scare me, and I hate it. I feel angry whenever someone talks down to me, and I want to hurt and kill people when it gets bad. I know its wrong, but I dont know what to do, and how to not feel like this. I cant talk to my family about this because they are the direct problem. I hate them and want them out of my life. I live in a boarding school, in a different country from them, but when I do see them, it always makes me worse. I dont know what to do",
    "Deep depression and struggling marriage Hope this is withing the guidelines and acceptable Is there anyone going through something similar or can relate? Im in a marriage that I have been struggling for years and things just arent getting better. I am 30plus with 2 children under 6 yrs old and been marriedtogether 10ish years. If I get too emotional, I just get left alone till I calm down. Hasnt ever looked into how to help. I am not and never have been suicidal or wasnt to hurt myself or anyone. However, my depression can consume me sometimes and I have a day where I barely move, hah. I never let the kids see me like that, but it gets exhausting. I react emotionally and basically get ignored. If we fight or my spouse is mad at me and I cry, I get ignore. My spouse cries? Especially if its cuz Im mad, I feel like complete crap and try to fix it all day. I also have issues being honest with what I dont like. Like if something passed my internal boundaries, if I think saying something will upset someone I care about, I dont say anything. Theres a lot of other stuff going on as well but these.are not mentioned. So, is there anyone going through anything similar or can relate? Any thoughts, advise? Not sure how to end it",
    "I am really struggling with people touching me Ive been having a pretty rough two or three months. This means even that I feel uncomfortable having my boyfriend touching me. I have talked to him about this twice how Ive been growing distant and disliking anything to do with touching he is a person who loves touch. It seems like even though Ive told him how bad it feels having someone touching me, he keeps doing it and it is starting to suffocate me. He is always asking why I dont touch him and stopping me to hug me or touch me in some way. This is making me quite irritable as well. I am waiting to get help from a doctor and see what I can do about it, but can you guys give me some advice on this? How can I get myself to not feel this way? Ive been forcing myself to take it for a while now and it just gets worse?",
    "I (F16) self harm and I need help I have been fighting depression and dark ideas for 3 years. None of my friends know this, but since I was 10, every time I get angry or sad because of something or someone, I feel the need to hurt myself. I often need to externalize my emotions and I throw them on me to punish me. Mentally I dont really make me feel good but I also bite and hit myself. At every bad event in my life I feel the need to do this because I feel like I deserve it even when I know that its not my fault.

    "Partners psychiatrist invalidates his feelings and even told him to break up with me. My partner was diagnosed with depression as a teen and has been in treatment since. However he has been complaining how his psychiatrist doesnt really care for his feelingsno empathy doesnt let him talk etc. We have been seperated by the border closure since Feb 2020 and obviously this has been so hard on us both. We became stronger as a couple, but mentally exhausted ,appealing for an exemption and being apart from one another. He has been having a hard time these days, with loss of job and being apart, So when he was talking about this to the doctor, the suggestion had been to breakup with me. Clearly my partner is distressed and has not been having a positive experience with her. She also thinks Im with him for visa. I am from a culture where depression is a taboo topic so Im not well informed about it. I have started my research, yet confused and want the best for him. So, is it right for the doctor to do this? Is it normal? Because I feel like its unethical and unprofessional. Every time my partner comes out of it, hes tensed and more unhappy when it should be the opposite. I want to help my partner. I am scared and I dont want anything happening to him and want to make sure I do the best for him. He is the sweetest person and he has never given up, and have always been trying so hard. He deserves the best care possible. Please advice. Also please give me tips on how to support him when the days are bad. Thank you.",
    "Cant get motivated to do anything, even shower Im going through my first very difficult breakup after 12 years of marriage to a man who is my best friend and who knows me and I him better than anyone, hes been my other half for so long, and he was my first relationship ever. I am living with my parents while I try to basically start my life over, on my own, and my depression has almost completely engulfed me. There are a lot of days where I can hardly motivate myself to get dressed, let alone shower or other basic tasks. I try to go outside and at least take a walk but even motivating myself into doing that is like pulling teeth. Ive been thinking of making a couple lists for me to check off each morning so I can at least get a routine down. I need to find a job and start being productive so I start feeling better about myself and my situation.",
    "Nothing feels good 22M. Literally nothing feels good. I spend my day solving tediously difficult problems with little resources and poor instructions. Hours of frustration. Eating is just another chore that doesnt bring any joy, unless I eat bullshitjj foods in which case again it will make me feel even worse than the little pleasure it brought me. Masturbating is basically a desperation attempt for something to feel good but honestly its just lack luster, there is no real desire. And if I watch porn it will feel good, but I dont because porn will make me feel even worse after. There is no emotional support from anyone, no one cares about a young mans feelings. Finishing at the gym makes me feel a little good, but its fucking exhausting and the energy and effort I put into it feels as shitty if not more so than the little dopamine I get after. I think this is where my problems with women come in. I want them badly, because sex with women feels awesome. Having a woman around is validating and feels awesome. Cuddling feels awesome. It feels like a woman is the only thing that can bring good feeling into my life without having an immediate and often worse downside. And I know this is problematic thinking. Everything just feels shit. And everything that feels good will make you pay.",
    "Finally spoke to my parents about my depression. Their reaction wasn't quite what I had thought. I 20M have been living with depression for the better part of a year now. I was always afraid to tell my parents because they worry too much, and I didnt want them neglecting their own health over mine. However, the circumstances over the past few days, added with the COVID19 outbreak and the subsequent quarantine has broken me like no other, and I finally opened up to my parents about my feelings. They told me to stop being a baby and to just snap out of it. What do I do now? I have never felt so lost in my life. And this is coming from a person who hasnt had a proper social interaction in more than a year. Any help would be much appreciated. Thank you.",

So I need some help with my motivation, and basically even though Im able to force myself out of bed and get up, I still cant find the motivationenergy to do stuff brushing my teeth in the morning, doing my work etc. Currently the only way Ive gotten the motivation to do anything is by chugging a can of monster I need 2 cans a day usually and I heard its pretty bad for the body.

    "I don't wanna feel like this anymore and I'm too broke to be depressed. This is my first time telling anyone about this so excuse me as Im rambling. And please dont say anything like Thank you for saying this and taking a big step. That really makes me feel worse about myself. Honestly Im getting really sick of feeling sad and angry all the time and when Im sad I couldnt stop crying and I couldnt control my tears which is pretty bad in Singapore where Im living where general people will isolate you when you show any signs of mental health issues. And I couldnt make any friends here because of my nationality and all the prejudice I get just by being myself has been repeating itself in my mind every day. Not only that but also workplace bullying has led me to be even closed off and led me to not be able to leave the house because I felt as soon as I step out of house people will judge and isolate me which make me feels like there is no point of going out anymore. I know iTzzZ NooO BiGG DeALzzZ, all the teenage girls hv this once in their lives. From the two psychiatrists Ive visited and Im 26F but I really wish I could move pass all these experiences and how it makes me feel all the time but I couldnt manage to find a therapist who I can trust and is empathetic. And I couldnt afford it regularly since Im couldnt force myself to work for the past 8 months. I hv tried getting help from public services here but the experiences was truly horrible and it has made my condition even worse. Ive been reading books hoping I could find an answer but that doesnt really work and it couldnt calm me down. I really need help to get out of this cause I dont wanna keep spiral into this again and again. Thanks in advance!",

And picking the right surgeon. But also cant breathe which has declined the quality of my life. Feel stuck in catch 22 hell. Revision surgery again is worst nightmare for HSP, highly anxious, depressionprone, peoplepleaser and controlfreak type of person.

    "Please Help: Spontaneous Suicide Attempts - 25 y/o Female My wife 25 year old female whom Ive been with for 8 years, recently attempted taking her own life for the third time. I was lucky enough to notice something was up, and prevent the act. When she isnt in a depressed state, she is smiley, friendly and she even manages to excel as a grad student at a top school. She has been battling with bouts of severe depression and suicidal ideation for her entire life. These depressive episodes never seem to correspond to events, but come on spontaneously. I think its also worth noting that her biological aunt committed suicide when she was in her 30s and it was also unexpected and didnt seem to be related to any specific occurance. The first time my wife attempted suicide was in college. A friend called 911 and she was briefly evaluated at the ER and then released I think she lied about her real feelings. A few years later, she suddenly told me one day that she felt she needed to be admitted immediately for her own safety, and I drove her to the hospital where she voluntarily was admitted for about a week, and was finally set up with a psychiatrist. This is where things got a little bit better for awhile the psychiatrist prescribed some medications that really seemed to help, a lot. She seemed to get down less frequently, and she said that her depression was more mild and less frequent. She also said that the voice that tells her to harm herself was far less common. Her medications have been adjusted a bit over the course of a couple years Ive included the current medication regimen below, but unfortunately things are still far from alright. While her depressive episodes seem to be less common, she still has occasional, spontaneous serious suicidal ideation. Recently, she made an attempt in the middle of the afternoon that I was able to stop, and by that night she was smiley, laughing and back to her normal self. This latest attempt has made me realize that we are not out of the woods, and she needs more aggressiveserious care if she is going to survive. I asked her if she was fully honest with her psychiatrist about her suicide attempts and her ideation, and she admitted that she has downplayed it.",
    "Getting suicidal again So Ive tried to kill my self twice now and I swore myself to never try it again but now all of a sudden I have these thought again, everywhere i go i think damn i could jump right there, I could buy meds there and die slowly. Im happy for most of the time, or at least I can be happy but Im actually depressed deep inside and I dont know why. A long time I coped these feelings with drugs and alcohol but stopped because i knew it wasnt good. I just dont want it to get worse again because dying is the only thing I can think of right now",
    "At my wits end.... literally. I’ve lost all hope, I’m lost in my own head. So numb, tired, and ready to leave already. Its been roughly a year, I recently moved out of my parents house around this time last year. And its all gone to shit... I guess I rushed into adulthood faster then I should. Was promised a job from my mother in law. That only lasted 3 weeks. Ive been bouncing from warehouse to warehouse job for the last year. I feel disconnected from my own life. Worthless... like I dont belong. My relationship with my SO is rough. Theres days where its the ideal relationship, and days where I feel like Im the only one loving and actually trying. My relationship with my own family is little to none. I dont have the courage to say whats really going on. Idk I would rather people not care about me. Not worry or pressure me about whats going on. But Im at the end of my road and my last options are dark. I cant keep a job, cant keep a place, cant hold a conversation with family and friends. Im so numb and hollow. I cry randomly throughout the day, suicidal scenarios play out in my head all throughout the day. What if I wasnt around? People wouldnt have to worry. I wouldnt have to live a life I feel like I dont deserve. Ive contemplated actually doing it numerous times. Just cant choose on how and where as in stuck babysitting majority of the days. I feel like Im rambling all over the place but its how I am at this point. I have no structure in life. My schedule consists of doing everything for everyone else and then sleep. I feel useless and more importantly worthless.",
    "Felt like I just should die, even if I don't want to. Hello guys, It must be like three days that Im registered on Reddit sorry if I say something weird or wrong, english isnt my first language, you can correct me if there is a mistake and you feel like it, thats not a problem I hope and I was trying to give an advice to people like just an advice that I believed was good to follow if a person was in a bad situation with someone with wrong intentions someday. My point was only to help, and I never said in the comment in question that Ive got all the knowledge in the world and that my advice was an order or whatever. But yet, somebody just told me that I should not have said what I said the advice because in her case which was a very bad one, like a situation I hope nobody would live, even if I know that everyday people unfortunately experience it and I had too, but I never said that in my comment or in reply to her because I didnt have to and whatever and I felt really attacked by her. Because she made me really feel like a bad person, as if I was even coupable of what would have happen to her in the past, and she told that BECAUSE she did not do what I was giving as an advice, she lived. But if she did what I have said, she would have been dead, and she made me feel really guilty about it. The point is, that I was just trying to help and she didnt have to talk to me like that. I didnt knew where to post what I am posting right now, because for the record, Ive been depressed for more than ten years and I experienced like, almost one time a year one time could be hours, days, weeks or months of me feeling like I really should kill myself. And Im even in one of this episode for a few weeks and everyday I try to help at least one person a day. Not to feel better about myself, but because I want to help as many people as I can and I know that it could help.",
    "I've been alone for so long I think I'm losing communication skills I felt like I resembled a corpse because of how dead inside I really started to become, and even became more and more obsessed with death and wanting to be dead. Now that Ive been shy and lonely for so long when I actually try to talk to people I have a hard time forming the appropriate sentence to match what the person had said to me. Or I might form the sentence awkwardly making my point much harder to come across to them. I feel like I have to stop and really put together a sentence in my head before I can say it or else itll just not make any sense when the person Im talking to finally hears my response. Or Ill hesitate while talking and then itll mess up the flow of what I was talking about and I cant piece back together the sentence I was trying to say. Ive slowly became more and more self aware at how many times Ive had to just completely scrape a sentence midway through because of this hesitation while trying to speak, people probably think Im crazy by now. I have nothing interesting to tell people either so when Im at work and the person whos talking to me shares a story about them that happened recently I feel like Im not given back to the conversation because I have no story at all other than depressing stories to share in the conversation, so 910 times Im simply forced to only comment about their story instead of sharing my own stories. Otherwise I dont talk at all, not unless someone else starts up a conversation with me. I kinda dont even like talking to people anymore because it just feels like its getting really difficult to make a conversion work when Im a part of it. Only being able to reply to their experiences instead of giving them insight on my own personal experiences. I also have a extremely difficult time looking people in their eyes for more than a second, maintaining eye contact just feels really uncomfortable. I feel so much pressure from other people too, like if I drop something I instantly feel like everyone is watching me as I pick it back up. Or when I was in school literally just standing up to turn my paper in made me feel like people would judge me for my appearance or how I walked or whatever.",

My supposed best friend has barely spoken to me in a few months. I just feel so lonely and desperate for friends. If I even had a job I could try making friends that way but its so, so difficult to get one. Theres no clubs or activities in this town other than the gym, and even then, with Covid, you have to understandably and rightly stay distant from everyone.

My boyfriend refuses to live anywhere that isnt urban especially somewhere as rural and uncultured as my home, and theres no cities within a 4 hour distance from my hometown, which wouldnt help at all. Idk what to do, I cant imagine my life without my boyfriend, but I cant imagine living like this without my family near me for much long either. Am I pathetic for being so close to my family and not having the strength to put effort into building a life separate from them?

    "My girlfriend (22f) no longer can find enjoyment in things that we always loved doing Me and my girlfriend are huge music fans and a big part of our relationship is going to gigs. We used to go to a gig almost every week and it was always really good bonding time. She has depression  anxiety but she was pretty comfortable in gig enviroments as long as she has some personal space. For a couple of months she has seemed more awkward less excited when going to gigs. We went to a show last night of a band she really loves, and she seemed uninterested  unhappy throughout the show. On the way home she admitted to me she doesnt feel any excitement for going to any shows at the moment she doesnt know why and is sad  frustrated as it was one of her favourite things. She says she feels panicky and stressed to just be there. Its hard to understand what couldve triggered this big change and i dont know what i can do to help her. Its hard to know how to make her happy if she doesnt seem to get enjoyment out of anything. She says im the only thing keeping her going which is really hard to hear and feels like a lot of responsibility.

    "Are my feelings valid if I don't cut, or harm myself? I feel like this is a hard topic for me to approach, but I would like to express some things Ive been feeling. Before we start, I would like you to know this is going to be very long, and explaining things that happened in my life, and what I am feeling at this moment. Thank you, all. Truly, Im not sure if I am depressed, but at this moment Im not willing to seek out help, outside of virtually. I hope you all understand that. But I am sad, that much for sure. I cannot express really in words what I feel, other than the fact than waking up is seeming to be a struggle at this point, always feeling overcome with such a gloomy feeling, where if anyone pushed me Id be constantly on the brink of tears. The entirety of being constantly upset, trying to cry, trying to find a way to let out the emotions which you didnt even know you were feeling, but being so empty, you cant even muster tears. I believe I started feeling these feelings around a year ago, after getting out of an abusive relationship. I became so dependent on one person, that I thought I couldnt cope without them. I made excuses for everything they did in my head, and always ran back to them. When they blamed me for their suicide attempts, because I didnt show them enough affection whilst they were hospitalised, though I do not know if she was truly hospitalised, or if it was another facade, I broke. I sent over 100 messages a day, as I knew this would happen if I would not, but she didnt want me to feel happy, despite anything. Not even in the simplest of things to brighten my spirits per say. Anyhow, I had to discard my friends, she had complete control over whom I talked to, and whom I wanted to be friends with. And she forced me to choose between her and them once again. I picked her. It may be irrational to some people why I would do it, but when someone starts convincing you how much you need and rely on them, with all the things youd planned together, with what you said, the words they, and you, said. Its so hard to turn away.",
    "Skipped school to kill myself, didn't go through with it, what now? Please help me, anyone. Hopefully this all makes sense, confused and tired right now, and Im going to not go through and reread anything like I usually do as I know I would probably just end up deleting this post, so hopefully this isnt too confusing. Itll also be long probably, sorry for the long read, but I need to at least get down all of what happened. Just need some advicesupport, or whatever please, Im not really sure what I need, like I said, Im not in the best state of mind currently. ampx200B Ive skipped school maybe 56 times this year when things were too much, as school is one of my biggest stressors and I dont even see the point sometimes, just to get a mental break. Ive never done much on those days other than lie around, or maybe play some video games if I felt like it. These were the worst days for me, constant suicidal thoughts since my parents and brotherssister wouldnt be home, either at school or work. These are the days that I kept toying with the idea, feeling safe in a weird way, I know that I could kill myself if I needed to. I havent skipped for about a month or so, but all throughout yesterday I was thinking as I get closer and closer to graduation, theres a time limit of sorts on when Im actually going to go through with it, as it gets closer and closer I feel more pressure that I have to do it, because I feel like I need to kill myself before I graduate high school, Im not sure why. Today I woke up at 630, and as soon as I got up I was already battling with the idea of whether or not to go to school, and this thought stayed with me throughout breakfast, throughout my shower. I told my brother, who I normally walk to school with, that my alarm woke me up late and that hed better walk to school ahead of me if he didnt want to be late, so he left. I literally did nothing for the next 30 minutes to an hour, literally felt nothing, just thinking about what I was going to do.",

Now Im around 130, which I know is still nothing, and I dont think Im fat or anything like that, but Id never in my life gained weight, and suddenly I was 10 lbs heavier in a matter of a few months. All of this paragraph started around the same time. Today I was talking to a friend of mine over the phone and for some reason he just asked me are you depressed? Which left me thinking, yet my college classes distracted me for enough time. Today at dinner my mom finally lashed out over my lack of hygiene, its then that I realized I havent showered in months, nearly a year of sometimes washing my hair or just standing under the water every once in a while. I showered and it dawned on me that I, probably have depression. The mere realization made me cry more than Ive cried in years. I read all about seek help and tell your parents about it but Im kind of ashamed to admit it. Theyve given everything to provide for me and my sister, and Ive got all the ingredients for what Id assume is a normal and functioning life. It feels like I have no right to be feeling like this when theres people who have it much worse than me. Im posting it here because I need anonymous support. Im not yet ready to admit it out loud,but I think Im depressed. P. S If this is long, boring, or just hard to read please forgive me, Im not even sure if Im thinking straight and I just wrote down everything as fresh off my head as I could.",
    "35M in dire need of support/advice Hi everyone. It is my last resort posting on here but I just dont know what else to do? Ive been struggling to keep things together the last few days. Today I just broke down as I couldnt keep things together no more. First of all Im a mature normal person other then my mental health problems. I am on meds and see my doctor regularly. Just today I had a breakdown. Id rather not contact emergency or go to the hospital as Ive been there before an they hold me from going outside. I have payments to make and cannot afford to be held in hospital as this will screw things up even more. I live in a small town out in the country. Tonight I decided to go out for a walk, I end up in the ditch just watching the stars is where I am now. I am feeling empty, I cant help it but fall into tears, I just dont know what to do. Im also feeling alittls suicidal but not the biggest risk just yet. Just looking for advice or someone I could chat with? Feel free to pm me. Thanks.",
    "I lost all of my friends and live in complete isolation. I want to change... It would be helpful to hear stories of people overcoming this situation! I had two really bad hypomanic episodes. I did some insane things that Im shameful of. Since my hypomanic episodes, I pushed away everyone and stayed disconnected for years. I couldnt face them after what I had done. Through that process, Ive lost everyone. Has anybody been here? Im lost as to how to make new friends. I basically dont have a personality anymore... I feel uninteresting as hell. Not to mention, Im out of practice. I dont really know how to spark up a conversation anymore.",
    "Which antidepressant worked for you? Hi all, Ive been actively fighting my depression for years, since I realize it was there. Ive been taking Lexapro for a couple years now. Seems to take the edge off the worst of it but like today I woke up really depressed, ie dont want to live anymore, life feels meaningless and just endless pain and disappointment, I feel like I serve everyone around me and no one really cares about me. Im not suicidal...well lets be real, I am because of the depression but Ive decided not to remove myself from life... Thatll happen whether I like it or not and itll always be an option but since its so permanent Id prefer to see if I can fix my brain and be delusionaly happy like normal people. So what worked for people? Appreciate it before I try the permanent option. Thanks all!",
    "I am lost after pretending to be badass for 2 years Hello, I am college student and my life isnt best if I can say that, I was bullied at elementary school, my parents was alcoholics, from my 13 years I have a problem with drugs and alcohol, at year 2018 I had a pretty good relationship but I was pretty melancholic and she left me, so I had half year depression full of crying, wanting to kill myself and drinking booze and eating pills, after that one day I was magically blessed or so and I dont had depression anymore, I was new me, but as I am older I realise I was just hiding my emotions and now it just spiked to the point I am literally lost, I dont have much friends I am crying I dont have a energy for my school tasks, I am working at Mcdonald which is hard and I dont have time for nothing, I think I am ugly, my teeth are broken and I am at a point I dont know if I can help myself, everything I want is someone to talk to and hug when I am broken so I can fix myself, but I struggle with making new friends because everyone thinks I am junkie badass without emotions, I dont really know why I am posting this here, maybe I am hoping for a miracle? I dont know, but if you have some opinion or something I would like to hear that. Sorry for my English and if you are struggling, know that you are not alone, hope everyone gets better, love u all.",
    "It’s over My friendship with a boy I love has seemingly finally come to an end. I lack the strength to get over him and its been months. Im too low and tired. I honestly dont think Ill ever see him again and it kills me. I dont know how my life could ever get better at this point. Alone for 4 years. Too shy to even use social media to make friends. Lost my new job due to another lockdown. I dont imagine Ill ever get over him. Every day it seems less likely Ill live to see 25. Im 24 now and my birthday is in spring. The only reason I am alive is because I dont want to upset my mother or brother Sometimes when I cross the street I dont look for cars because at least then theyd see it as an accident and not blame themselves I know thats wrong, I am just so so low and alone in this life I just wish he cared again",
    "I suffer from persistent depression and my GF wants to leave me. Last night she told me she did not see a future for us in that way. My sombreness, some of my anxiety fueled behaviour and display of a victim mentality hurt her and have crossed certain boundaries. She meant to tell me this before, even left some breadcrumbs via text. I only noticed her pulling away, losing interest or giving me the silent treatment. I could have guessed this was on her mind but maybe I was to scared to have a talk. I feel sad that she has been dealing with this for a while and how difficult that must have been. She told me that shed given me the benefit of the doubt a couple of weeks ago but never mentioned this to me like so. I do feel her way of going about this, her communication could have been better. But then again this must have been difficult and she told me that it felt like abandoning me. I am so caught up in my current mental state that I have trouble going about things. Like litterarly doing anything some days or going somewhere on time is hard, and I hate that! Dealing with my thoughts, anxiety and all that other crap made lose myself my self worth and the man I wanted to be. But ive crossed her boundaries and I completely understand why she did not want this situation anymore. She told me she still loves me and does not want to give up on me. She recognises this is my situation and that I am not the guy she fell in love with right now. She needs some time to find herself and I need to get a grip on my situation.. I want to improve my communication and our communication. I want to manage my outbursts better. I want to manage my anxiety better. I want to regain my self confidence and self worth. I want to stop this victim mentality, I hate it! I want to regain trust and to reconnect. I could really use some advice and would love to have your input or experiences. TLDR Dealing with a bad depression episode that changed us and my relationship. She can not take things anymore and wants out, how can I improve things?",
    "Scared to take medication Im 31M scared to take medication because of possible sideeffects. I know it might affect me sexually, and with a gf, Im scared that failing in bed will just make me feel even worse. I know therapy is an alternative, but it costs too much. Ill be able to afford it in September when I start working fulltime, but its a long way away. Ive tried everything and Im close to losing it. If I never had a mother, Id consider ending it all, so I want to get help now, which is why Im considering meds. I have been diagnosed with depression a while back so I know its not just a phase that has lasted for over 10 years, but Im also considering getting my test levels checked as well as Im getting older.",
    "I'm so tired I remember the next day where during all of class I lied in bed, not saying a word to the friends I usually talk to all day, it just all felt so hopeless. That night I remember asking my mom to look into therapy again then went upstairs and lied on the floor of my room for a half hour crying and trying to vent out what I was feeling, but everytime I talked about it I was too scared to fully explain to my friends, leaving it coming off as a student wanting to be lazy rather than sheer hopelessness and a severe lack of any will to keep living they it really was. I took the AP exam yesterday on my birthday, it was fine enough but left me wondering why I even did that, why did I go through all that stress and mental fatigue to look kind of good for colleges? I was tired, tired and done with dealing with this. So here I am a year later, lying in bed with no will or motivation to do anything else. Behind on my school work, and vastly unprepared for an SAT coming up in a few days, just wondering when will it be better. I dont want any of this anymore, I just want to sleep, Im so tired of everything, Ive been burnt out for months with no end in sight, why wont I feel better? I have a test for my drivers license coming up next week too, which cause me to again spiral and type all this, when does it end? Will I ever be just content with life? Im tired of it all, why wont it get better? When will it end? Is there even a way to cope anymore?",

My mom and dad were both Jordans, they were never married.

    "Student nurse with severe depression bout - how can I help? My fiancee is a student nurse after a career change and is currently in her second year. She had setbacks due to COVID and a broken wrist which still requires a reset operation that she is putting off because of training. Her last placement was absolute hell and she had deliberately obstructive staff rather than anyone who would sign off her competencies.

Ive been in a horrendous depressive episode for the last 18 months over my live Ive been depressed all but 6 years, but it comes and goes in waves steadily its been getting worse and worse, becoming suicidal, secluding myself, and all the other lovely things that go with it. I want to die, I dont want to be here anymore, and before you suggest medication, Ive been on every medication for depression also multiple for anxiety and a couple antipsychotic meds too. Counselling has never worked for me, I stopped doing illicit drugs years ago stopped smoking, stopped drinking, tried exercise and diets. Yet, I still have suicidal thoughts and feelings everyday, all day, and night. I wake up sad that I have woken up. I go to sleep hoping that I have stroke or heart attack that kills me in my sleep. Ive planned my suicide so many times and in so many different ways, I have attempted suicide a few times in the past. Now to the crux of my problem, I want to die, but Im scared of actually being dead. Any thoughts or suggestions will be welcome. Thanks.",

I work a rotating roster and my body clock is everywhere, so I dont really have a routine which makes taking my meds at the correct time very difficult. Sometimes Ill have a fleeting moment that Ive forgotten to take them, but my brain quickly dismisses it as if its not important. I dont really know how to explain it.

    "Depressed firefighter ends things My 30 f ex boyfriend 34 ended things from depression at the beginning of the shut down from covid. He told me he didnt love me anymore almost 3 weeks ago. I dont know if this is how he really feels or if its the depression closing him off to feeling anything. I havent spoken to him since he told me. But I go back and read older messages leading up to the break up and I see him telling me hes struggling with the depression but he tells me how happy I make him and how much he loves me and I keep him afloat.

Has anyone experienced this before from my position or even from his that could give me some insight of how their stories progressed with their loved ones as the depression lastedor while you or they got help? I believe in my heart he does love me and the depression suppressed those feelings. You dont just have those feelings disappear from a happy relationship without some type of issue going on. Ive been dying to reach out to him but I was the one that said I needed to heal, but with the riots going on and him being a firefighter and his mother telling me he said the therapist is getting him to open up I want to reach out so bad. Can yall share your stories and give me any insight on his possible feelings or what people did in my own personal shoes?

    "I’m sick of everything, my life is just meant to be miserable. Its a long post, but I will appreciate any feedback from anyone who decides to read it! My struggle with depression started around 20172018. Im currently 18yo. Sometimes Im more stable than the other day, there are the times that Im capable of controlling how I response to big waves of emotions. But its never totally gone, it likes to come back and my behavior is often caused by some unhealed memories or habits from my lowest times. I get embarrassed when I get emotionally involved into a conversation, I hate the thought of making my mental health an excuse, but sometimes I just feel like I just ran a marathon, I lay down and I cant help but cry because of such a failure my life is and how weak I am. I have an abusive father, my family and I tried everything to solve problems and help him change but he wont listen to anyone. Our family is pretty much divided to responsible men my oldest brother and my father and women that should do everything around the house so everyone else, especially my father, can live comfortably. I have five siblings. Since Im the oldest girl Im expected to be the major housekeeper except my mom. Im also the one with the most sense of being fair and respectful towards what I have and whats given to me, thats why I rarely skip my responsibilities or deny any request or help. I feel overwhelmed about the amount of stuff I need to do, not to mention the way my parents treat me when something is not done perfectly. I graduated high school with average results, Im neither the smartest nor the dumbest person on earth. I dont have any specific abilities nor passions to pick a solid university major that would make me happy and open a career path that would let me sustain myself. Now that I can apply to college, my score is slightly beyond the minimum. I picked a major about Korea, the country and the language, its something I got interested in, I am studying Korean for a while. But when I realized how much points you have to have to get accepted I lost any excitement that I had, I barely meet the requirements, most people have tens of points more. I dont stand out in any way. I was never liked at school.",

    "21 male, in post-relationship, feeling awful. Hello friends, Ive been thinking recently I need to talk about whats going on. I feel like my family members have heard enough of it and they dont really give me the answers or ease that I need. I loved a girl, and she loved me. She had always been dealing with mental health issues. She acted in ways she expected Id want to facilitate the relationship. In more blunt words, she had sex with me because she knew I wanted it even though it wasnt enjoyable for her. When the issue became clear, and the distance between us bolstered, I became restless. It seemed to me she had stopped loving me. I begged her to get help for the issues, but they were so deeply connected to her life that she was hurt that I would suggest the she could overcome them. We eventually broke up. I dont think either of us stopped loving the other. She hates me now, thinks Im some kind of asshole liferuiner. All I ever wanted was for her to be happy. It was trauma and sadness preventing her from being happy, and no matter how hard I tried, I could not help her. That was months ago now. I started to distance myself from it all. But I still have dreams of holding her and telling her I miss her. Yesterday, it came back with a vengeance. I cried and pained, looked at her social media, seeing directed passiveaggressive posts. It was really painful. I shouldnt have done it. So I need support. Should I just be pushing through this and moving on? Some part of me wants to fix it and love her again, but I know that wouldnt be good probably. And I know that if I was back with her, I wouldnt feel the love that I am searching for. It just hurts. I dont know how to feel. I just wish I could forget. Any support and advice would be amazing. Just to know that somebody out there recognizes Im not the bad guy, I wanted her to be happy. But my own needs became my care, and I stopped supporting a person I love because of sex.",
    "I've given up trying to change because all I do feel less and less bad for myself when I fail Im an 18 year old male. Ive been able to do nothing but reject any help I get or fail trying to get myself back on track. Nothing really motivates me, other than distractions so Im not reminded that I wont be able to keep myself alive in the real world. Any support I receive now is all I rely on, and I have no reason to be lazy and unwilling to do anything about myself. Yet whenever I try, I always wind back to the start. I surround myself with positive people, but all I manage to do is shower them with support instead of myself. Ill admit, its because I know theyll use that support to succeed, unlike me. I used to be afraid that Id always be like this, but now its just a reality Ive accepted, and its made me bitter and unintentionally hostile towards those who know more about me than the carefree mask I put on. I like to think that when I get I job money will motivate me. It wont. Ill just be stuck in my own world and just accept the fact that Ive been fired after a week. Ive tried before. Its done nothing. Its a problem that affects all aspects of me. All of them. And it makes me feel like less of a person when I see others get back up from worse. When other people lash out at me for being defiant and wasting their support, or not being of any use or having any real reason to be kept around, I just sit there and take it with a blank face. They tell me things I already know, then try to lighten it by them just being angry in the moment, or just trying to get me to wake up. I know what they say is true, and I can tell that they hope to God that I come to my senses and start improving myself. Ive been this way as long as I can remember and nothing good has happened. Ive only become more numb to the situation and more accepting of my failure. I used to care. Alot.",

Currently, Im working on my next video which will be about Depression and I could use the help of this Communitysubreddit. My background allows me to understand the science and psychology of depression but, luckily, I never have suffered from it myself though I experienced it secondhand when my mum got a major depressive episode a few years back. So I want to add to the video by infusing it with personal stories and experiences of real people who have suffered or are suffering from depression. I have 2 questions 1. What would be the single most important thing the public gets wrong about Depression. What do people who never had any experience with it dont get? 2. If anyone wants to share a story or personal experience with depression that I could incorporate in the next video anonymously without username if desired I would be honored.

    "Mental health issues Okay so Im a 17 yr old girl on her menstrual cycle and prescribed 20ml of an antidepressantantianxiety medication called fluoxitine and I have questions for people who are in a similar situation. Is it normal to feel so depressed and irritable, so much so that I cant even be around people without being afraid Id saydo something not in line with my regular personality and while constantly experiencing mood swings and almost intrusivelike suicidal thoughts without the urge to go through with it, kind of just like oh I should just die then in response to a negative thought I feel like Im going crazy, would the medicine normally prevent stuff like this? I cant tell if this is genuinely a problem or if its a combination of maybe teenage hormonesmenstrual hormones. I dont go back to see my therapist for another two weeks Im just so out of ideas on what is wrong with me or what I should to stop feeling like this. Its been like this for two days straight",
    "How to help boyfriend with depression who won’t open up to me My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 2 years. We both have had our struggles with depression. Recently I see he has been feeling down once again. He doesnt want to go to a therapist because  he knows whats wrong, he just doesnt have the motivation to do anything about it. in his exact words I dont want to go to therapy because I see therapy as guidance method for improvement. I dont feel like I need guidance, my problem is one of will and circumstance, I dont doubt that I could benefit from it, but right now I see it as going out of my way to do something I dont prioritize Even though weve been together a while, he still does not feel comfortable opening up to me about how he is feeling. Ive asked him ways that I can help him feel better, or support him and he says that talking about it wont make him feel better. Is there anything I can do to help him? I hate seeing him be down like this and be unable to help him. Ive also tried giving him space and left him alone for a bit. Am I being selfish for trying to help him? Are there other things I should try to help him feel better? Any words of wisdom or advice would be greatly appreciated",
    "My friend is suffering from severe depression and I want to help her but I'm not sure how I 17m moved to Houston from Toronto last January and I have kept in contact with one of my friends in Toronto 17f who is clearly struggling with her mental health. We stay in contact over snapchat and shes opened up to me a few times and Ive tried to be as supportive as possible. The last snap I got from her she said something about how shes not sure she can make it through the next couple weeks. Ive never experienced any mental health struggles as severe as what she is going through so I dont think Im in a great place to give advice. Ive tried to just listen to her and be supportive so far but it doesnt seem to be helping her much. The physical distance between us makes it even harder for me to see how shes doing as I dont get to see her at school on an everyday basis like I used to. What I can I do to best help her without being pushy? And are there any resources that I couldshould reccomend to her? Any and all help is greatly appreciated.",

    "I am suffering Wanna start by saying its okay im okay one time the police showed up when i posted in a suicide forum. I AM FINE My life is leading a very interesting and difficult path I doubt I will ever get married or meet anyone I miss my old life and freshmen college days of having friends and being a pretty girl. I dont understand my exisistence I thought I was trans for a time and went on testosterone and it deepened my voice and I am not the pretty bubbly, bouncy girl that was once popular and well liked. Men dont like me I have an entirely diffferent group of friends and sometimes yearn for the old one and my thoughts run away with me at night. I never had dysphoria I just hated my period and thats why I went on hormones. I am on birth control now to keep it stopped but I just struggle with life, humans, and wondering why I exist. Idk what to do after college I am petrified of life and I will most likely never be loved I just struggle with being 21 and progressing high school sucked I was in a homeschoolprivate school Duggar type of environment and every day was torture. But it was easier. I had not been on hormones yet. I was innocent. I was a pretty girl. I was well liked. Boys liked me. Its gone now. All gone.",
    "I don't know what to do at this point other than end it. Nothing has helped so far. I have no personality or sense of self, either. I live with an overlying sense of guilt that I am at fault and that I deserve to be hurt, or worse. I have no hobbies and no interests, and never have. I do not enjoy anything I do in the slightest. To cope with not feeling anything, I have kinda reckless sex, hurt myself, and binge drink. I also occasionally smoke weed. The way my mom has treated me has ended up with me being diagnosed with borderline personality disorder BPD. After a hospitalization at 15, I was diagnosed with adolescent borderline personality disorder, so I have had it for a while now. Several therapists said I showed all traits by the age of 13 but couldnt diagnose me because of my young age. Anyways, moving on. So firstly, Im living with completely untreated BPD. The nearest specialist is an hour and a half away, and I have really bad insurance. My disability checks were taken away when I turned 18 last year, and my mom gets mad at me when I try to call to ask to fix this. My life is a living hell. I feel nothing at all, but at the same time, I feel everything at once. There is a void that I cant fill no matter how hard I try and Im in agony. Suicide is always on my mind, every hour of every day. I hurt myself often and binge drink to deal with the stress, or occasionally have reckless unsafe sex or smoke pot. When I was first brought to therapy, my therapist and psychiatrist had evaluated me for autism spectrum disorder and ADHD, and tried to refer me to a specialist. My mom screamed in his face that her perfect child could never be autistic. I have never been evaluated again, but have talked to my school counselor. She says Im most likely living with untreated ADHD or autism spectrum disorder, but most MOST likely both at once. My brother, who is emotionally and intellectually disabled, has both of these. So does my dad. Its in my genetics.",

    "I don't feel original anymore. When I was in high school a few years back, I was one of the highest competitors in my school. I joined the high school band in freshman year and by senior year I became one of the best in my section. My academics were always straight and I exercised daily. Senior year I enlisted in the military and now I believe it was one of my worst decisions in life. Before I went to boot camp I was motivated, a patriot and believed that the elite joined the military. In senior year I never applied for any scholarships and I was offered one but turned it down because I already signed the papers. I thought I set myself up for success. Now I believe I was dead wrong for joining. The only benefit I see so far after a year and a half of service is that Im trying to set myself up financially before I get out and hopefully attend college. It sounds like a plan but I feel no happiness from what I do at all. I convinced myself theres no honor in it anymore, its just another job. I dont exercise by myself anymore. I feel like Im not progressing anywhere in life being in service. Im just a body and if I wasnt here doing what Im doing, thered just be somebody else doing the exact same. Im replaceable. Thats the mindset the military gave me. I look forward to going back home in 6 months for vacation and thats the only thing Ive been looking forward to since Ive been stationed. After that, the only thing I have my eyes on are getting out of service, going home, being closer to my family again. Theres nothing here that satisfies me and I hate it. I feel like Ive tried everything to be happy here but it seems impossible. I wish somebody could help.",

    "I need ideas.... I know most of you are going to say that I need to volunteer, and while that is a good idea and was doing that briefly in the past before they got rid of me because they needed to use me more than I could offer, I am currently recovering from a series of 3 surgeries, and am not really at a point where I can feel comfortable leaving the house and volunteering like that  if I could even find something youd be surprised how hard it was for me to find something in the first place. Having said that, I do agree that I need to get out of the house, my big qualms with that are that 1 most of the time I need to kill is during the day  when most, contributing members of society who arent drains on the economy like I believe myself to be, are at work, and I have a severe lack of interests. Im interested in sports and watching t.v. and movies and surfing the internet like I said....and thats about it. I dont read I find reading to be somewhat difficult and as a result, a chore, I hate listening to music due to my shitty taste in music as all the bandsgenres I liked growing up have all died out and my tastes never matured, I cant cook to save my life.....like its so bad Im afraid Im going to seriously hurt myself burnset myself on fire, cut a finger off, etc., Ive got like 3 friends and a fourth I see once in a blue moon I ever see on any sort of regular basis two of which are married, but are often busy with work and married life, theyre new house, and are about to have a baby, etc. I wish I had more, but I made only 1 friend in college that I stayed in touch with, and the other two are a HIGH SCHOOL friend and his wife. I guess I just never really learned HOW to make friends and it doesnt help that Ive developed crippling social anxiety when it comes to new social situations or environments. Its gotten so bad and Im so isolated due to my myriad of circumstances, that I have gotten into the habit of trying to make online friends via things like Reddit, but that only does but so much for socialization and killing time.",
    "Feeling Lost I have Anxiety, PTSD, Bipolar Depression, Pulmonary Embolism, Obesity, and Mobility issues, and I am only 35Mliving in the Seattle Area. My selfconfidence and selfesteem have been depleted. I believe in God, I am Christan, but I dont have a home church because I dont have money for the buses. Its hard for me to go to medical appointments because I am just tired of the frequency, and if there is bad news, its only me and my shoulders. I dont have anyone to share the burden with. I have a giant hole inside of me, and I cant fix it. This past week or so, I have had this sense of feeling lost, and I have been sleeping almost all day and up most of the night. I am homeless, jobless, and I am also semidisabled. I use a fourwheel walker to help me get around long distances and a cane around the apartment. I have been staying with friends since I lost everything in a fire in February 2016. Because of my weight and health issues, homeless shelters wont take me because I am a highrisk liability. I sleep on the living room floor at my friends apartment, and their adult boys love to be up all night and play video games, so I dont get the best sleep. Eye masks and earplugs dont help me. I cant sleep in a chair that I have because I toss and turn. They dont give me the respect that I need so I can sleep and do stuff like hold down a job. I have lost several jobs because of my unstable living situation. I have no savings, no family to ask for help or stay with. One good thing that is going good for the most part is I am going to college online for a Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity and Networking, and I have one year left of schooling for the degree.

    "Will it ever go away? (Self Harm/ suidical thoughts-- Trigger warning!) Will it ever go away? I thought that I beat this sht, but what happened last night said otherwise. I have suffering from depression for a whole year! It started last year, 2 semesters ago, with it being compounded with ADHD led to an emotional devastation. It had gotten so bad that I would self harm everynight using an absurdly sharp keys to scratch my upper right arm I am a lefty and one night I decided to cut myself three times using scissors. During that semester I would often write I wrote like Da vinci to make it harder for others to read! things about the emotional pain and that I wanted to die. After the semester was over my mom pressured me to get help. I was put on meds. After awhile and an additional medication I felt better, though took awhile to feel better. Fastforward to today, well last night. When I just bursted into tear and cried myself to sleep, and lately I been having passive suicidal thoughts and I sometimes wish that one night that I will go to sleep and not wake up. In addition, to ADHD and depression I also got GAD and I had a panic attack today YAYYAYAYAYYAY!!.

I dont eat much, cause my family is going through a very though situation so theres not much to eat. Im in college and I get stuff to do all the time. Ive been a very good student so far, but lately, Ive barely had the energy to check on my assignments... I feel terrible for not putting much effort anymore, because this might be probably the only way I can help my family in the future. I cant sit on my desk and get things done bc my arms feel heavy and my head empty. I thought that maybe getting a new job would help me getting my life together and distract me from everything that happens at home, so I applied for part time tele marketing jobs, but dont receive any call backs. My teaching job is very unstable so I decided to step back because it was taking more than it was giving me... I feel the constant need to cry and just curl up in my chair and stay there forever.

    "How can I (28f) help my Mum (56f) who is depressed and considering suicide. Grandmas health has been worsening and Grandma is resisting the idea of going into a care home. Although Mum isnt dealing with Grandmas care anymore she is still stressed about it. She believes she is getting bullied at work claims to be getting coldshouldered and that people are hiding her belongings. She has worked there for about 10 years without incident before now and I have not seen any other evidence for this aside from her word which I do not consider trustworthy in her current state. I have tried to help her by Convincing her to begin antidepressants again which she is refusing to do, she will get fat again. To at least see a therapist she is refusing to as it doesnt work, also the only counselor in town is one of her cousins who she has been fighting with see above, I asked if she would consider travelling to see someone in another town or even zoom sessions with someone but she still steadfastly refused. I did ensure that she has helpline numbers easily accessible saved in her mobile, on the fridge and beside all the landlines in the house. Encouraging her to reach out to her friends and have a coffee or meal together she refuses to ask because she believes they will reject her invite, a why bother mentality. She also refuses to go out when they do invite her to things because she doesnt feel like it. Actively making plans with her which she has always bailed on despite apparent excitement beforehand. I have been in contact with several of her close friends and explained my concerns which they have shared and asked if they can make special effort to explicitly include her when getting together which I know they have as we have been in ongoing contact but she still has not been engaging. Taking all her calls and trying to gently help her see that some of her present mindsets are distorted when she calls I want her to recognise that she needs help so hopefully she will be open to trying something. Offering to pay dues for any clubs or organisations she would like to try as she claims she can not afford them. Offering suggestions of free community events she can attend. I also offered to attend with her if she would like she took this offer as an insult that she needed supervision.",

So my problem begins maybe three years back. Out of nowhere Im randomly sad about myself for no reason in particular. I brushed it off as regular old sadness and have no other thought. Then a couple months later I notice its happening more and more frequently. I thought it could genuinely have been depression, but I was convinced into brushing it off as teen angst. Over the next year it stayed the same, random bouts of sadness and lack of motivation for a day or two at the time. Fast forward to now and Ive started being sad nearly daily. I can sometimes go a week and rarely close to a month without experiencing severely as I have, but like I said thats it sometimes. I have suicidal thoughts so often theyve stopped bothering me. I quite often cry at night and have recently started drinking when this happens. I sometimes think I want to die but I know there are people who care. I have a loving family and great friends. I just cant get what I want out of life and I dont want to live a long unfulfilled life. Dont get me wrong, Id much rather be happy and live for as long as possible, but part of me wants to give up. Im not asking for professional diagnosis, but would you say this is regular sadness or am I verging on depression? Thanks, anon",

    "The Story of This Year I cried everyday, I never left my room, I avoided everything and everyone. There was parties in my house and I just laid in my room and cried while the world went by. It may sound ridiculous but I havent had a great life and the smallest things get to me. After the month, I kinda got over the overdose and went about my days. Life started getting a bit better again, there were more smiles and laughter. One of my house mates during the time we lived together was terrible with money. He gets paid at 1230am every Sunday and goes out every Saturday night so usually he spends all his pay as soon as it comes in on drinks. Because of this, my room mates and I had to cover his rent and food throughout the week. This lasted for a few months. Things started getting worse with the guy, he gets very angry and started masking his problems with drugs specifically weed. He would go out everyday and get really high so he didnt have to deal with his problems, my room mates and I were getting very broke trying to support him and it got to the point we couldnt anymore. He never paid us back after countless promises and he never did anything around the house. One night we got into a massive fight and I kicked him out, we stayed friends and we spoke all the time and we learnt it was better this way. We became closer not living together because we didnt have the tension and added stress. Im sorry this story jumps a lot, theres so much content that I cant really focus I didnt realise till after I kicked him out how much I spent time with him. My other two room mates were sleeping together since the start and they would spend 60 of their time in bed. Because of this, the room mate I kicked out and I got really close because we only had each other. After kicking him out I was very lonely. I dont deal well with being alone and I constantly need company so I feel okay. The male room mate out of the 2 that were sleeping together ended up finding another girl he liked and he spent a lot of time with her which left me and the girl to get very close.",

She was unemployed for a few months while she searched for something else and I was the only wageearner during that period. My car broke down, we lost our storage unit, I struggled to make rent, etc. Shes working again and making more money doing something thats better for her health and Im so happy for her.

    "Dae have a therapist that does this? Shes registered and a doctor so Im inclined to give her the benefit of the doubt, but honestly shes not been helpful at all. I want an outside perspective so that I can know if its on me or her. She talks just like a distracted friend instead of a therapist. 13 word responses. For example, I told her I was frustrated and felt lost about something, and she just said understand. Her solutions are things I could come up with on my own and basically boil down to her just saying no every time I bring up a harmful coping mechanism. I already know whats wrong with me and my life but not how to fix it! And she believes that I should talk the most in therapy but I dont feel heard when all she does is....listen? If that makes sense? I dunno.... Ive just been spiralling into a worse and worse place mentally and depending on her and getting this seems to be hurting more than helping. But then I have no idea what therapy is supposed to be like. Is it supposed to be really hard before it gets any better?",
    "I want to learn to appreciate the positive gay inclusion and acceptance, and stop letting homophobia and gay exclusion and alienation burden me I am a feminine gay guy. So, not only am I guy, but I like being feminine too in my appearance and behavior. And especially online, I keep on and on and on coming across SO many people against homosexuality, andor people against men being allowed to be feminine. ampx200B And what I have been using since I was a kid to try to help make me feel better is feelgood escapism in the forms of movies and shows. But as an adult, I cant even use that, since the type of movies and shows Im interested in keeps excluding homosexuals and feminine guys. And even when they dont, the representation is poorly handled. ampx200B I love fantasy, I love science fiction, I love superhero stuff, I love animated stuff. Literally only example of a feminine male character Ive seen depicted in a good proper way is in the Youtubeexclusive animated show Hazbin Hotel. And, when it comes to a homosexual male romance where you get to see the two males fall in love, share their first kiss, become a couple, and stay a couple without either one of them dying at any point? To my knowledge, it doesnt exist within these genres. ampx200B But I try very hard to stay positive, and appreciate what I DO have as opposed to what I dont. I got that Hazbin Hotel character Angel Dust. And I got an openly gay male character in the ParaNorman movie, and in Avengers Endgame. So, good step in the right direction I suppose. ampx200B And furthermore, people ARE getting more gaysupportive, and more people are encouraging gay inclusion. So rationally, I should know better. But I keep feeling so sad and depressed and tired of life, feeling like there is no escapism properly working for me whenever I feel down. And I just dont know how to deal with it.",
    "Boyfriend broke up with me a week after I got a shocking diagnosis, says my mood was too bad lately hi, frankly Im here to hear some motivational words. Ive been suffering from depression since I was a child, this was diagnosed by a psychiatrist. Ive been feeling better for a while. However, after I got with my boyfriend it definitely got better. Now last week I got the shocking diagnosis, that I might not be able to get pregnant naturally because of an undetected infection that I had at some point and Im going to surgery in a month due to chronic pain as consequence of this infection. Ive been really depressed, angry and frustrated lately. I just think that this could have been detected sooner, as Ive had pain in my lower abdomen for a while. On top of this, Im really stressed from university because I have to do a lot of homework and also work. My boyfriend of 2 12 months just broke up with me because he said that Ive been in a bad mood and he feels affected by this. I cant believe that he would just leave me at a time like this. Hes shown 0 empathy for my situation and always said I should stop feeling grumpy. I mean honestly. I moved out of my student housing room during the weekend to go live at my dads place during this difficult time and discovered that there is mold in my room now. I just feel like I cant catch a break and wonder how I can deal with this. Im so shocked because he always told me he loves me more than I him and that he really adores me. And now this. I mean its good that I know this now after such a short time rather than later. No one can use a partner that wont be there for them during difficult times. Im just having a hard time grasping this situation. I feel even worse now that he told me his reason for breaking up was that my mood had been too bad lately. I am afraid that I will be back to my major depression due to the course of these events. Im probably gonna phone some therapists soon so that I can deal with this situation better, as I fear that I might selfharm.",

Im sorry I dont have enough Karma, I just never have enough gumption to post and I migrate accounts often for feeling like Ive messed up. These past few weeks have been tough. Ive been bottling it all in and Im just so tired. Ive noticed signs of depression through an increase in sensitivity, time spent crying which went from nothing to suddenly tearing up at night.. Ive noticed myself being unable to clean my room or find energy to go work out, and I either sleep too long and feel guilty or spend all night awake exhausted but unable to sleep. Im so tired. I cant do anything, I cant even hang around my friends because it feels like they hate me or Im not good enough. I either try to starve myself to feel the pain of hunger or overeat to get rid of the pain. I have no one to talk to. I feel guilty and Im not diagnosed so Im wondering if Im just faking it, but Im too scared to bring it up to my doctor because last time she brushed it aside. I cant talk to my parents because one is mad at me and the other thinks Im dramatic. I dont know what I want, if anything can someone just please tell me itll be ok?",

Ive never had any real friends, never been in a relationship, im not close with any family members, and the only texts I receive are from my parents, which usually just keep mocking me for not having a girlfriend and asking when im finally going to go on my first date. When I was in high school I was addicted to pills, and I also developed an eating disorder, and nearly died twice. I remember spending time in mental hospitals, spending time in intensive care, etc., and the only person who even came to visit was my mother, who came once after an overdose, and she just said she was disappointed in me and grilled me about why I did what I did. In the past 3 months Ive lost 3 friends, one to suicide, one to a drug overdose, and one to cancer. I feel like im going to explode, and I dont know what to do, and I dont have anyone to turn to. I need advice on how to move forward, and how to get out of this situation, please. I dont know how much longer I can go on like this anymore.",

Both of us have depression amp anxiety symptoms flaring up, and she has chronic pain. Weve been very isolated to our room. Its already been cluttered and disorganized by her move 1 year ago, and since we have very little energy, its more and more cluttered, including boxes of takeout. Its state affects us very much and though weve tried again and again to gain motivation and energy to at least do small things, we havent been able to do much. We talked a few times about reaching out for someone to clean and reorganize our room. I also know a few skilltrading groups where I could ask for help, and offer some kind of compensation. I also thought of asking friends for help, but Im scared of imposing. We dont have that much money either, but honestly we havent been able to do much for a while now and I just need help to take a step forward. I just feel like Im being very lazy doing so.

I make music and thats cool, but I never go out, never want to do fun things with my partner, never want to do much of anything besides play video games and watch youtube while mindlessly scrolling.

    "Letting my boyfriend commit suicide. Please help. When I think about him being dead I get so many instrusive thoughts about him not being okay if there is an afterlife  that hes lonely, scared, or in more pain that he was here. As illogical as it may be, I think about how he might be scared, experiencing regret, or in pain in his last moments  I think about how that will lie with him forever and hell never get to know that he is finally okay. I know it probably sounds extremely dumb. He says hes not scared of death, and that helps me slightly. Im in so much pain now, and Im scared of how much pain is to come. I think about the moment I find out that hes dead and how Ill just want to scream at the top of my lungs. Ive been suicidal myself for years now and I think this is what will push me over the edge. Im scared of that. I love him. Hes my best friend, and I wanted to spend my life with him. Hes lying in the other room right now, and I dont know how to manage when the day comes where I can no longer go and lie next to him and give him a cuddle. Im terrified if forgetting him. Im trying to make mental notes of his features, and smells, and little things he does. Unfortunately, derealization has made my memory very poor. Were long distance, and have had very little time together in person. Im from the US and hes from the UK. I dont think Ill be able to attend his funeral because I wont be able to afford to travel, and covid might not allow it anyway. Im not sure Ill ever be able to step foot in the UK again. About him Hes mid 30s. Hes been on disability his entire adult life. Being dependent on the government for money and housing is one reason he feels hopeless. He believes hes locked out of ever getting a decent job now and doesnt think hed be able to cope with one anyway. He doesnt like his living situation. Hes very pessimistic and misanthropic. He thinks he may be in the autism spectrum.",

Its only been a year since I was diagnosed with epilepsy and I think I seriously underestimated how much it was going to hurt my already not excellent mental health.

As things increase in stress, Im getting closer to a huge episode and its freaking me out. I dont know what to do with myself.

    "Girlfriend started taking antidepressants and pushing me away Hi 24 Mmy gf of 4 years 22F has  I believe been struggling with various degrees of depression for a very llong time probably since before i met her but she only recently 1 week started to get some medical help. She just got worse. She rarely talks to me and when she does it is short answers. Most of our conversations are about her telling me how shitty she feels, sick, or seeinghearing stuff because of the meds or how she just wants to sleep all day. I decided to give her some space but today I really felt like calling her to check up on her and in the first 30 seconds of the call she started acting like an asshole to me and i got pissed. I now feel shitty about it because i know she is struggling but at the same time I wont be treated like a carpet. Its important to know we live close by but Ive been out of the country for almost 2 months now so we havent seen each other in a while  I should return in a few weeks. I dont know how to help her.

    "Forcing yourself to do things you normally love during depression Im in the midst of a 5 week bout with depression, which for me has nothing to do with sadness. Rather, depression for me is a horrifying head fog that disconnects me from all emotions, interests and appetites. All I can feel is the fear and anxiety of being in this state of mind. If you suffer from this flavor of depression, or any flavor, do you force yourself to do the things your normally love even though you cant connect with that feeling of enjoyment? For me, doing this and not getting the reward makes it all worse, but I also dont wanna wait around to feel better to do these things, If that makes any sense. What do you do in this situation?

Previously Ive tried to kill myself in 8th grade, I never really tried after but I feel urges too still. Me and my dad had bad falling outs, three times, in almost the same year. I almost lost my mom and my brother because I was always angry and upset with the rage I let control me. Ive lost all but few friends now that Im desperately holding on too, but I just dont know if I can continue to deal with this pain because no matter how man counselors or therapists Ive seen it alway just seems to never get better.

I started a new medication yesterday, Fluoxetine in liquid form to be consumed orally after breakfast, i was drawing as usual but suddenly i got memories of stressful moments of my life, which made me incredibly angry, i reached the desire of screaming and punching stuff, havent break anything thankfully. After 5 practice sketches i decided to call it out for the day, now im in the bed eating junk food out of depression. These things happened before, but this happened in such a unusual way, it normally happens after my ASSHOLE dad pisses me off.

To sum it up Ive been dealing with health issues the last year that have made it to where Im in bed most of the day, and worse of all at home with my family more than ever. Ive been working with doctors to help find a solution to my health issues, but tests have been unhelpful, and my next appointment to see a specialist isnt until January 2022. I cant begin to explain how close I am to ending it. I hope I can find some helpful advice, but there is literally no resource in the world where I can get the medicalmental help I need. I have no friendsfamily to go to, and there isnt much more I can take of this. I literally physically cant do anything to escape this other than suicide. All advice so far is to hold on and let my mental get worse and worse, while my physical health doesnt get any better. Please someone say something different that will actually help.

I have been dealing with anxiety for around 3 years now, and have been experiencing depressive symptoms for around a month. I dont want it to sound like Im complaining  but I just feel exhausted. Im tired of always trying to be better, to improve and hoping that things will change. I had seen different psychologists over those 3 years, and although one had worked really well for me  the rest felt like I was just talking about my problems without actually coming up with a solution. Honestly, it feels a little bit surreal for me to even be writing a post  because Ive tended to lurk reddit for so long and just read things. I know people say that things will get better, and yes  there is COVIDlockdown. I just become so angry with myself that Im not improving at the rate that I really want to be.

I just fell worthless, helpless, dumb, ugly, all the worst things, but I cant explain why. I feel like my life is pointless and I dont know what could give me a point. Now I start to think that Im just losing my money on therapy, because all I do is crying infront of woman that asks me questions I cant answer. Should I keep going? What should I do?

So, with that in mind, heres whats I need help with About a month ago, I tried talking to my dad about my cuts. I went to him and showed him my recent scars and he asked what they were. I told him they were cuts with a razor blade and he didnt ask me why but instead started screaming at me about me not studying and that I cut myself because of Youtube As it had rotten my brain. He told me that he would have listened to me and helped if I had gotten good grades Like, above 95 but since I havent gotten good grades I have like a 7580 overall, he doesnt give a fuck. I couldnt even tell him about what was bothering me. The first thing I said was insecurities, and he said I dont know the first thing about being insecure. Then I said anxiety and he went on and on about how I have no anxiety and its all just due to Youtube. This went on and on and I just stopped speaking. Like half an hour in, he told me that I should just take a knife and slice my wrists so I can die once and for all and how it would be great and he wouldnt give a shit This was pretty descriptive. He told me exactly where to cut and how much time it would take me to die. Also, to slice them in the bathroom sink so the bedroom doesnt get dirty After like 1.52 weeks after this convo, he came into my room and told me that he got irritated because he couldnt understand what caused me to do it and he had cried later that night. Now I dont know if I should believe him or not.",
    "I ( 26 female ) have decided to take care of my severely depressed younger brother (20m ) by letting him move in with me last week and need some tips. Not exactly suicidal in that he does not intent to kill himself but he is fed up of living so could very well do something dangerous if this continues . I have been pestering my brother to move out of my parents for the longest time. He finally did last week and came to live with me. I congratulated him for taking the right steps. I told him he always has a place with me. And this is why I still took him in despite having reservations as I am not exactly where I want to be in my life financially either but I am doing better than him and better than before so I felt like its worth a shot  and still do  . He has never worked a single job because of his mental illness and because of my parents hostility. This past year I have focused a lot on healing from my own health issues had two surgeries and heart issues but I feel better than ever before and also getting over a breakup which is hard for someone like.me who tends to get reactive depression as a result of difficult life events . Im doing well at work, was recruited by my manager to follow into her foot septs and applied to a program at McGill university that my employer would pay for the purpose of developping my career at the hospital I work for. I work in admin and might work in management following this management succession program  if they accept me because even though I was recruited still waiting for acceptance letter .

    "I feel depressed but feel like even more of a loser for feeling depressed. I have a stable job now, albeit not something i wanted to do nor do i enjoy. Everything good ive ever had in life including that job, and basically all other jobs ive had is pretty much because of my dad and my last name. All of my friends who started off with so much less and dealt with more pressing issues in life went on to do so much more. I feel pretty much hopeless in finding something that i really want to do or because im not like them. Im definitely not the smart one or the good looking one or the outgoingfunny one. Im the only one whose never really had a girlfriend. Im pretty much just the rich one who at the time was a pity friend of a few guys i knew my entire life and grew up with but a lot of the people I came across in both high school and college never really liked me, not because i was an ass im relatively quiet, but because i never fit into a lot of those circles because of this or that yet because my childhood friends were friends with those guys, i was kind of just a fringe guy to them and still am now that im home. Sometimes i think i put myself in the wrong groups of people in life because i didnt have the social skills to find my own. This whole idea of me not being good at anything worthwhile has really carried into my early adult life. Its to a point now where im afraid of failure more than anything. Im afraid of a lot. Ive been feeling depressed off and on since about July on this go around. I get discouraged probably way too easily. I also feel like a disappointment. Im afraid of telling people that im depressed or that i have struggled with depression in the past. It would disappoint my parents because theyve given me so much. It makes me feel pathetic that im depressed because of everything i was born into. Sometimes i would fight the notion that what i was feeling was actually depression given my situation, but that was always redirected to me just being soft or a pussy in my mind that made me feel even worse.

    "Goal in life: not to feel suicidal Im a pretty solitary person. I rarely talk to anyone on or off this internet. I think Im happy with this. Ive tried the normal life for a couple years and have reverted back to my introverted, solitary ways regardless. Ive rarely felt happy or enjoy many things. Most of the time Im fairly blah. Im perfectly fine with this and I usually am pretty bored unless Im working on class work university engineering student so I am not bored often lol. I find most things boring, even video games most of the time which Im sad about bc I loved games growing up. ampx200B All of this, Im fine with but one thing. Thats feeling like I dont want to live anymore. It happens occasionally when Im stressed out or extremely frustrated. Its pretty much always bc of all of the schoolwork I have to do or an upcoming exam. My life is completely consumed by schoolwork which would be fine if I were comfortable in it, but Im constantly behind or dont understand stuff. So that just frustrates me more. The last time I wanted to die was about an hour ago. I was frustrated at having spent my 13th hour non consecutive on a homework assignment. I wasted two hours of my life sulking and looking up various ways to kill myself. Finally found one that doesnt make me scared. Its the one where you put a bag over your head but pass out from innocuous gasses like helium. ampx200B So what are some ways youve found to counteract these random depressions.

I live in a 3rd world country, so therapy here aint an option if youre not insanely rich, which Im not.

But they bitch about how the other one suck, what they do bad, how inconsiderate and ridiculous they are, etc. My dad does this more often. Also, I feel like my dad has become incredibly lazy. Hes 60, retired but is in perfect physical shape, in general. I know there are things that he shouldnt do anymore, but he literally wont eat anything during the day if no one else is there to cook. ANYTHING. He wont tidy up, he wont even move from his char if he doesnt have to. Im a college student. I got a ton of papers and things to study lately, since its my second year and I dont always have the time to do things. My mom works until noon and comes back to continue to work. Shes a teacher.

    "Could you read me? Hi everyone. Im 18. I just entered Reddit,and I dont know how to start but I just need to talk about this because I simply cant talk to anyone around me. The text that Im about to write is going to be very long so I think many of you will not read. Doesnt matter, I just cant take this to myself anymore. ampx200B Some of the things I will describe might disturb some people. I dont even know if Im allowed to post this. But here it goes ampx200B Im a male, 18 years old going to 19 next month and I have been diagnosed with depression for the last three years. At first, I didnt know really what was the reason for my depression thats why I always recommend people who dont have a actual reason to be depressed to go to therapy and take a deep look into your life. You might find something that was really hidden in your subconsciousness. ampx200B Well, thats what I did. ampx200B I am going to tell the story of my life. For some reason, writing it helps me to process my thoughts. And yes, I want people to read it because Im just terrible expressing myself in real life, and I just want people to know, but I dont have the courage to tell it in person. ampx200B Okay. So I was born in Brazil one of the reasons that Im writing in English its because Im the only one in the family who speaks a little bit of English. So Im sorry if theres some bad English here. The city that I was born is really violent, which is the reason why my mother wasnt very pleased with the idea of me going to play with other kids in the neighborhood. My father, worked his ass off during the week, but was an alcoholic, and once even tried to kill my mother. Nowadays, hes fine and theyre still together. But those days were tough. So, since I was a child I was really close and sometimes, hyper protected to my momand the only other child company that I had was my brother, who is 3 years older than me.",
    "I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts for as long as I can remember and it's only getting harder to reason against harming myself. I never had a catalyst or anything for my depression or suicidal ideations. Its just been present for a very long time. Ive gone through prescribed regimens of medication, seen counselors, stayed active and healthy, made friends very easily, and just overall tried to keep myself out there and try or experience new things to see if I could find that calling in life for myself over my life. Things have generally gone very well for me in life other than the numerous times I let my suicidal thoughts get the best of me and I either let shit fall apart or an attempt on my own life puts me down a notch. This has been something thats just always been present and feels very dominating as a part of who I am. It used to scare me and I used to want to feel better than this, but I just feel completely indifferent and empty to it and everything else in life now. I dont have the energy to pretend Im a normal person or talk to people, I dont experience any emotions, all of my old hobbies and such feel like a chore, and I cant envision wanting anything in the future. This depersonalization side of my suicidal ideations has been going on for a couple years now and more than ever I just cant find any reason or desire to stay alive. Ive been miserable for as long as I can remember and I know its not right, but, at this point I dont know any other mindset other then feeling this way. I know how to be a decent human being, I do good at work and such, Ive developed very close relationships in platonic and romantic senses before, but nothing makes it feel worth the effort at all. Im at my wits end and I got rope today and Im so afraid of how much itll hurt but I want this to be over with so bad and I just dont know what to do.",
    "what would you guys do? 27M from São Paulo, Brazil. I live with my mom, 53, and dad 88. Since 2012 hes diagnosed with Parkinsons and dementia. I struggle with depression since I was 15. mentally, Im always judging and blaming me for not having a job, not have become a doctor, rich, so I could pay caregivers for him, and hire someone for helping my mom at home. Ive graduated in History. But where I live in currently theres no job for teachers not to mention historian. I could tell all my story, but Im not looking for apologies. Im just desperate I dont want, Im not mentally able to take care of him. Im furious, frustrated and really angry to confront him sick. I fear to do him some harm if I get completely tired of things he is not blamed for not being able to eat, go to bathroom and walk for himself. Im seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist. But the meds are doing no good yet. What would you guys do? If you really feel unable to get out of bed. If all you wanted was to sleep and dont wake up ever again. To put some noise cancelling headphones in order not to even listen to his voice shouting all the time for help or moaning due to his illness? Please could someone help me? Send some piece of advice?

    "Almost 25 and I want to give up, what to do?? long story short, I feel like I wasnt raised with a chance to successful in life. I grew up being very neglected, experienced all forms of abuse, and ended up leaving home at 16. I have struggled to finish school and have never managed to complete anything after highschool. I still struggle with PTSD and mental health issues. Ive managed to get sober almost 1 year and half sober however lost almost all my friends cause I dont want to go out to bars or clubs anymore, so it kinda alienates me from my peers. Ive been trying to make new friends but its kind of hard especially with covid. Im a bit over halfway through a degree. I am uncertain if I even want to do it though.. I want to give up. I feel jealous of a lot of people my age who are doing so much better than me in life but I also notice a lot of these people have supportive family emotionally and financially so I think it is unreasonable I compare myself to people who have not faced the same challenges. I know I need to accept that this is where I am in life, but it so hard to stop hating myself so deeply. I feel so ashamed for achieving nothing in life and just being a broken mess at 25. I want to end it all but I know part of me also has some hope that it could be better. But I just cant handle the shame.",
    "I’m gross and I’m letting everyone down So Ill just start with my job. I work at a restaurant. I really do love my work most of the time. And my coworkers and I get along and customers love me. But I have already been written up before for being late and today I overslept more on that later and was gonna show up 2 hours late to my shift when my boss told me not to even bother coming. I dont know whats wrong with me and my sleeping. Im always so tired. Ive gotten my bloodwork done and everything was great there, so I dont know whats wrong with me. I can easily sleep the whole day. I usually sleep around 12 hours a night and it never feels enough. The worst part is getting out of bed. Im also a really gross person. It takes so much effort for me to do dishes, shower, do laundry, heck, even brush my teeth. I am gross. Im getting so many cavities. I cant even walk in my apartment without stepping on things. My parents say that cleaning it is the least I could do for them and I cant even do that! I cant even take care of myself! Im probably going to lose my job! Everything requires so much effort and even when I just start with one thing I get so exhausted from it. Im such a dysfunctional human. I get an email from school Im in culinary school the other day saying that Im very close to reaching my limit of hours missed and that if I miss a few more, I wont be getting a diploma. I always do this. I used to be such a good student. Such a good daughter. And for years Ive just descended into this nasty incapable mess. I dont know how to get out.

    "Help with meals I have trouble eating. Hardly anything tastes decent enough to eat. Im a picky eater in general and when Im depressed I cant even make chocolate a favorite palettable. Often I starve just because food is so unappetizing. But I have to eat, especially at work because I become emotional and cry in front of clients. To complicate matters, I just dont have much energy to expend in making a complex meal or the know how to do it. Any recommendations for something I can take to eat at work? I have done sandwiches, ramen, and shakes, but the sandwiches get boring, ramen tastes bland, and the shakes arent filling enough if they taste decent at all.",
    "I feel like a waste and I don't know what to do. Where do I begin? I guess to start, I recently got engaged to the love of my life back in June youll see why this is important in a second. I am also in a very demanding work industry, in education. Special Education to be more specific. I love working with kids and it can be very rewarding, however, its the most taxing job. My fiancé is a very supportive person while also keeping me realistic. My dream is to stream and I used to and it was fairly successful, to my surprise, when I started. I gained a lot of followers, viewers, and even a few donations even though thats not why I started to do it. My stream was focused on just having fun doing hobby and trying to shine light on mental health. My 1 passion in life is to help others. And I have tried to find careers that revolve around that, but to much dismay. So my stream was to offer advice when asked, listen, and just talk. Talking helps. Even talking about random things. Anyways, she supported me while I did this during the summer. I knew it bugged her that she had to go to work every day and I got to stay home and fulfill a passion of mine. I am drowning at work and it has completely taken over my life. I find no joy in my old hobbies. Watching sports, playing video games, hanging with friends, etc. This past week my fiancé told me that I remind her of a hermit. I hate going out, hanging with friends, all that. I hate having fun is what she told me. Frankly, I realized this before she had told me. Furthermore, I am faced with the decision of resigning from my job and chasing my dream. The repercussions of this is that there wont be stable income coming from me, my fiancé doesnt make enough right now to support us both and we talked about it. We were looking to buy a house in the next year, as well. I feel like Im a waste though. Do I just nut up and suffer just to achieve the goal of getting a house?",

    "Do you fall out of love when you're depressed? Please. Anyone. My boyfriend and I had been together for 7 months. He first mentioned he was struggling in January with depression and needed to figure it out but had never felt that way before. We were still happy and talking all the time but I could feel him distancing himself still but he wasnt emotionally just physically. Then coronavirus hit... I saw him right before he went back to work in the beginning of it all, he had taken a vacation for 3 weeks when it was starting. After that last time I saw him, it wasnt for another week and a half until I saw him again and he was totally different. He was irritable, quiet, just NOT himself at all. During the time I didnt see him he hadnt seen his children either and it broke him. He broke up with me a week later when I saw he had basically broken down and mentioned he should get some help because he was different and suffering horribly. He said he needed to get better and it wouldnt be fair to me to wait. 2 weeks after ending things I asked if he still loved me and he said he didnt. He cut off all emotion from me. This whole time Id been trying to help him, was supportive, gave him sites to read up on it, got him to tell his mother, and also got him to reach out to a therapist through the fire department. My question is...did the depression make him stop loving me? Did he actually stop loving me or is it masked by his depression? Will he come back? Im drowning in despair and want the man of my dreams back. What do I do? Each time Ive seen him since that last day before he ended things he has been shutting off more and more...and eventually wouldnt see me anymore. Please someone help. I dont know what to do anymore for him. Or even know if he really just doesnt love me.",

    "I'm sick of how everybody treats me and the way my life is going I am 16 years old and I live with my entire family. Every day I am screamed at for not automatically going to cut wood or do the dishes and other chores. I am called lazy by my parents and my younger brother. I started to play video games because as a child I was never allowed any type of electronic and I was extremely curious. Because of how my family treated me I started playing more and more video games and it became the one thing that I actually felt motivated to do. I began lying to my parents about what I was doing and when my school gave me a MacBook with special programs in it because I have ADDI played video games on that. I became addicted and still am. My parent filmed me on a camera and now all my homework must be done in front of a camera. I am just sick of how everything in my life is falling apart. My parents made a contract for me to sign about the rules of the house. I signed it. There are special things like, finish all homework get 30 mins of screen time. There are also stupid rules like at lunch no tv, only homework. My parents want me to do exercise but I am already 6ft1 and 150 pounds. They scream at me when I want to use my 30 mins of screen time after I have done my homework. On weekends I sleep for 14 hours and I just feel like I am in a constant cycle of screaming and pain.

    "I could use some help ;D Its not what you know. But who you know. Been ghosted after my 3rd interview. What makes it worse, is knowing who was hired the industry is very connected online. Said other person had less experience and a worse degree than I. I must really suck at interviews or lack enthusiasm. All feedback I get is, you were great, but we went with someone else or you lacked enthusiasm when I smiled and did my best to be interested during the entire interview. The gaming industry is very altrustic. Ive been stuck as a permatemp for a 1 year 7 months. I have a first degree and a lot of experience. Employers still dont see my value and I dont know what else to do. Ive turned to alchohol to numb the pain, and its gotten to the point I dont care if im fired and lose my job. Im greatful for the opportunity, but im stuck, not learning anything new and I have been rejected from multiple opportunities at the company im currently at. I constantly aim yo better myself by asking for more experience, but im ignored. Then why am I kept and renewed contracts? Make it make sense. At this point, from my already nonexistent selfesteem, ive concluded im unlikable, too honest and its not what I know, but who I dont know. Alchohol is literally my best friend.

    "I'm so tired This years been shit, I just cant deal with it anymore. Ive tried so hard to be strong and do everything i could to feel better but its just gotten too much. Last year during summer I felt awful, no other way to describe it. Originally I thought it was from the quarantining, not seeing my friends, having to see the really state of the world that time was a very cold realization to a lot of problems in my country that just left me confused, sad and annoyed, but the more I looked for answers the more confusing it got. I just wouldnt feel better, Id sleep all day, not have the motivation to do anything I used to like, it was awful. Seeing friends and being around them apparently covered up a lot of what Ive been feeling. I spoke to a therapist towards the end of summer and it was pretty obvious I had an actual form of depression. In retrospect its probably been there for a while. A few years ago I remember random bouts of feeling miserable despite everything in my life seemingly going well, along with it hitting like a truck when things went poorly. Last year I remember not really doing anything I enjoyed, even basic things like turning on a game felt monumental, let along sitting down and drawing something, so for months on end I just didnt. Talking to a friend also made me realize just how far back it went, I dont really remember it at all but he told me about a time in seventh grade where I told him I was depressed. So here I am almost a year after its been diagnosed, a complete mess. Back to the end of summer, throughout the entire thing i fought with my family a lot, they didnt exactly care for the whole deadly virus thing and kept taking us out to see people. It was really confusing for me, it seemed so simple just wear a mask and stay home for a while to keep other people safe, but here I was arguing with my parents about how we shouldnt be going out. Thats when the topic of school opening came up, there was a virtual and hybrid option, I wanted to stay home and they were dead set on getting me back in.",

In the past Ive fell into pretty bad bouts of depression and in the process for some time I couldnt even bring myself to brush my teeth or shower. That was a while ago, not recently. Since then Ive been much healthier and Ive built a solid morning routine where as soon as I get up I shower and brush my teeth. But I keep struggling to build a bedtime routine as normally I just go straight to bed and crash out, sometimes even in my clothes, without brushing my teeth. Any advice?",
    "Advice coming off meds Hi, just wanting some advice. Over the past year I developed pretty significant anxiety and depression, and after a while, my friends at uni noticed and advised that I seek professional help. I was then prescribed antidepressants sertraline, which Ive been taking for the past few months. Things overall improved over the summer, but about a week ago I decided to stop taking them, as I dont feel very comfortable being reliant on medication, and I feel like my life is at a significantly better point now. I recognise that this was probably the wrong call, and if things get worse again I will get back on them. However, since coming off them, Ive been experiencing almost constant headaches and dizziness, to the point where I am sometimes unable to walk, meaning its difficult leaving the house, or meeting up with anybody, as I feel like I cant maintain the required amount of energy. This means my lifestyle has reverted to what it was like at the worst points of the last year, being unable to go outside, and feeling unable to talk to anybody on any medium. Does anybody know how long these effects last or if theyre normal?",
    "I think my boyfriend left me due to his depression and I need some help to understand and deal with this situation. Were officially broken up... but were not just friends. I explained my thoughts on this matter to him and he told me that he didnt think it through and maybe was overhasty to break up and admitted his actual reason for breaking up were his thoughts going in circles, so he just ended things to stop this  although it seems that this didnt improve anything for him. He said he doesnt know what his feelings for me are but he doesnt want to lose me and a lot of other things none of which sounded like things you tell a friend. I dont know what to do. I want to give him time but as far as I know, hes doing nothing to improve his situation and I cant take this much longer. I know that most people  especially in the relationship subreddits...  probably would just tell me to put an end to this and forget him. To confirm that Im not totally delusional for thinking that we might get back together, Ive talked to some friends... and surprisingly, no one told me to just give up and that theyre confused, too, and also think that his behavior isnt that of just a friend. And now, Im still here because Ive seen that he really cares about me and feels more for me than for a friend. I have the feeling that the actual reason for the breakup and whats standing between us arent not enough feelings or arguments or any other stuff... but his depression. Many people tend to cut people out of their lives too easily and I dont just want to leave this awesome person behind because hes going through a hard time. tldr Boyfriend has depression and broke up with me but still treats me more like his girlfriend than just a friend. His reasons didnt sound like they have much to do with me but more with his depression. Doesnt know what he feels for me but doesnt want to lose me and wanted time to think and work on his problems  but isnt really doing anything. I have the feeling he wants to be with me but his depression prevent him from doing so. Im so confused and dont know what to think or how to help him.",
    "jumbled mess/rant? (story + requesting advice idk) I want to see a doctor to get it clear if I have mild depression or something else. However I find it difficult to do so because I dont know how much it would cost as Im not financially stable and the culture and country I live in does not see depression well. I overthink everything. I think thats a main reason why I selfdeprecate. Because of that my selfesteem has dropped over the years that I feel I cant do anything good. I am rethinking my choice of study whether it was a good decision. I dont think I am fit to become a childcare teacher. I understand that the principal and mentor are trying to help my future but negative thoughts just keep entering my mind. I should probably go study something different in university... its hard to imagine teaching children anymore. Ive cut down on using instagram because I know it wont do me any good seeing how others live their lives. Sometimes it just triggers my overthinking whenever I see their posts. Ive been told I think too much, that I think for awhile before I reply when this person just wants to hear my honest answer. I think it kind of frustratessaddens her because she wants me to vocalise my thoughts and feelings instead of bottling up, but I still do. She says shes a call or text away but it is so difficult to contact her first because I dont want to bother her with my problems. Well I guess Ill just share these.

    "I can feel happy some days and other days I want to die. Hello, Ive 22F struggled with my mental health since I was young, I was bullied when I was a kid and developed social anxiety because of it. Then I became depressed in my teenage years, but got better when I was 20. Ive never been good at interacting with people, due to my anxiety I find it really hard to talk spontaneously to people, but at the same time I can get defensive over anything, like I feel people are attacking me or trying to make fun of me but in reality theyre just joking around. A lot of people dont like me because of that, I seem really mean but Im not, I wish I could be friends with people like a normal person but I just cant. Lately Ive been having good days and bad days, but exaggerated. When Im having a good day I feel amazing, Im productive and do a lot of things. But in my bad days I feel way too bad, I was clean from self harm for 4 years and I did it again like a week ago. When I feel bad I also cant stop thinking I want to die, I feel like no one will ever like me, Ill never get a job because I run away from good opportunities because of my anxiety. I just want to disappear but I dont want to kill myself because I dont want my family to suffer.

    "Im scared i will never have friends again I have had major depression and anxiety my entire life, but i stopped seeing a counselor years ago. In 2016 i had friends that i would hang out with that were also my coworkers. We drifted apart and its my fault. After getting a different job i had a lot of coworkers and some would ask to hangout with me, but i always refused. Something changed in me where i began to completely self isolate and push away anyone who tried to come close to me. Im an introvert, so i keep trying to convince myself that i dont want friends. But the truth is im scared of never having friends again. I realized that truly the only close friends i have in my life are my boyfriend that i live with, my mom, and my boss. Im grateful for them, but i feel self conscious because i dont have any other friends my age. I deleted all my social media because seeing my old friends hangout together hurts, as well as seeing posts of people with their friend groups. I waste too much time comparing myself to others. But now i feel 10 times more lonely without social media. How do i get out of this? I am too scared to reach out to old friends. Is it normal to have no friends?

    "How do I get to the point of WANTING to get better? TLDR  Depressed for probably 10 years. Heavy sucidal thoughts for about 5. Is there any chance of getting better if I dont even want to, or seeing the point of it? Alright, gonna keep this as short as possible, since Im tired of giving my life story and also I hate myself for whining about this and not pulling myself up. On the surface and in reality, my life is great. I got a job, I got a girl, I got an apartment. I got a dog. Im healthy. I believe Im quite intelligent although it feels like depression has made me very much more stupider and I forget things all the time. I got it all. I can act all extroverted and social if the situation demands it. I come from a broken home with divorces, drugalcoholverbal and physical abuse. But I still consider my childhood to have been good. I had friends, I had fun. I just dont want to live. I see no point in me continuing doing so other than to not mess up the lives of my friends and family or mostly my gf and my grandma, dont care too much about the others. I have a very detailed and thought out plan of how I would end my life, with small chances of failure. I know its not the right thing to do, but it would just feel sooo good not to feel like a useless piece of shit who cares about no one. Who sees no future or no reason in moving on. Who gets hung up on all his failures and shortcomings. Tried several different antidepressants in increasing doses over the course of 3 years. Only gave me side effects o I quit out of spite. Seen numerous doctors, psychiatrists and therapists. Only felt mocked and not taken seriously so I quit out of spite. Been admitted to the psychiatric ward sry, google translate, a good place to get depressed by the way, but I talked my way out of there after a week. Ive tried quitting my job. Quitting my band. Quitting my girlfriend. Exercising. Eating heathier.",

Im in therapy, on meds, I exercise, I work, but no matter what I do, the depression always comes back. What else can I do? How can I live the rest of my life like this?",
    "puberty? attention? depression? hello i am a teen who is going through puberty right now which is why i dont know if Im even depressed or what, if i am, then am i just seeking attention? everytime i think to myself that i might have depression, it just hits me that this is just puberty, im just seeking attention and whatnot, i feel really unhappy, i started wanting to eat less, wary of my weight i am very selfconscious and I cant sleep without using my phone to sleep, i feel like im such a failure to my parents who are trying to raise me with their best, i always tried my best to be a good child to them, not doing what they didnt want, but i felt like i suddenly changed, i didnt want to be a good kid anymore, following all the rules and having to hide whats not good within me, i just wanted to be who i am without trying to hide it from them like its such a crime, but I cant because im too afraid, i want to be honest with them and relieve this feeling off my chest but I cant, i always think theyll probably think that im just wanting attention, I dont want to be ashamed, i dont like the feeling of embarrassment, i just want to be alone, away from everything but i want to talk at the same time, its just that i always rethink it, when i think of talking with someone, my mind just rethinks everything and i eventually end up not talking with someone, so i wanted to talk here, with more responsible people than me I could also be probably just too self conscious, I dont know, im doubting myself with everything i think which could be the reason, making me not come up with an answer, Ive also been feeling empty for a very long time, i could laugh and be happy at times but it doesnt feel right, like theres something missing, i dont have any traumas that i can remember to be a source, im an introvert who dislikes social interaction and is comfortable isolated, i have thanatophobia which I dont remember having a trauma of either but i suddenly get panic attacks as if im being choked and my brain just goes blank, which i havent told my parents about either but i had a panic attack before in front of them which probably just seemed like i was just feeling unwell or something to them i think, i only remember it vaguely which is why i dont really remember what happened but I do remember them being passive about it ?, considering everything was completely normal and i dont remember them asking me why i acted like that, and right now as im typing, i feel like im making my parents look shitty even if theyre not and i know they dont deserve it and im just rambling stupidly like this but i felt like i just had to open up everything i hadnt told them since i developed bottling up my feelings instead of talking im probably better gone, but i dont want to leave my parents am i depressed or just over reacting?",
    "Can depression cause a bad memory? When I was a young teenager I was diagnosed with depression and an anxiety disorder. My entire teenage years were dedicated to getting better and school  friends were not my priority. I still had friends, but I didnt see them as much as most people see their friends. I went to a clinic to treat my suicidal thoughts and anxiety, so I missed out on a year of school. I finally got better when I was 18, but now I am in my twenties and Im realising that I barely have any memories from that time. I do have some clear memories, but most are related to my depression, but I can almost never remember any fun stories my friends bring up, that I was apparently involved in. Its 67 years of a weird blur. I keep seeing people posting pictures of themselves as teenagers, and talking about how crazy that time was and how much fun they had in high school. Their first job, their first boyfriend, their first drink. I am glad I got to the point where I am doing a lot better. But I do feel like a I missed out on a huge part of childhood, and dont have great social skills because of it. I was wondering if its normal to have a vague memory of such a huge chunk of your life, and if depression could be to blame? English isnt my native language, sorry for any mistakes",
    "Things just keep getting worse On the background check it says I was sentenced to jail  I wasnt, but might even been for failure to pay the fines. There may be warrants out for my arrest for failure to pay the fines, I dont know. They still havent told me what additional information they need, but I dont really think it could be anything but that. I feel like my mistakes and being poor the past few years are going to prevent me from ever getting a job and making things better. Ive made mistakes, Ive paid for them, Ive learned from them. But I just havent been able to pay the fines. Even if they decide to give me the job, I have doubts theyll have me start next Monday since people will be off for Thanksgiving. So I wouldnt even start working til Dec. and wouldnt get a paycheck until Dec. 15. And this job is remote and I cant work from home once the power is cut off. I dont have anybody I can ask for any type of help. And Im really feeling pretty hopeless right now. Its literally taken me years to get this 1 job offer and its looking like it isnt going to happen. I just dont see how things can get better when it looks like things are definitely going to get worse. I could use the public WiFi somewhere like the library, but I dont know how I could do that while being on Zoom calls for most of the day. Even with a headset Id still be bothering others when Im talking. If youve got a better idea of what I could do for a few weeks, please let me know. I would LOVE to have a good job, get caught up on rent and utility bills, pay my fines and get on with having a life. Im just so frustrated and discouraged and depressed right now.",

I know what I want to do and what I need to do. I even made a list which usually helps and here I am on the couch. Tv isnt even on but I just dont have it in me to get up. I just recently had a bought of depression mine comes and goes and its here right now. I hate myself for feeling lazy but I feel like the only way out of this is medication and Ive always been strictly against medication. I need help I dont know what to do and I just lost my insurance due to my bf getting another job and they wouldnt let me get on it. I have the link to try to get insurance through the state but I just sit here. Depression hasnt hit me this hard in a long time. I need major help.",
    "An I a horrible person for groping two people when I was 12? I’m now 15 The guilt and self hatred has been a burden since I came to the realisation of my toxicity when I was around late thirteen years old. I cant forgive myself, and although Im not afraid of people finding out, I hate myself so much and find it hard to live with myself. Though I definitely do not want to kill myself, Ive been having suicidal thoughts recently because Im such a toxic horrible person. I admit to myself that my actions were horrible but I still feel like my life has been completely ruined because of those actions. Am I a sex offender? I cant live with myself, I dont know what to do. I want to talk to someone like a professional but I dont know how I can. I live a complete facade all my friends think Im an awesome person but obviously they dont know that I am a vile and selfish possible sex offender. If people found out Im sure theyd hate me. I just dont know what to do. Im sorry for rambling on.",
    "I REALLY need help Im 24F. Im sorry if my english its bad, i speak spanish. Ive always been a little sad, i mean, nothing to worry, i think, because i felt happy sometimes and used to enjoy things. Ive always been too obsessed about the way i look, i think in a pathological level, avoided meetings because a felt ugly, dont eat or eating way too much, etc, so thats why i think this situation feels particularly hard. About a two months ago i thought i had a cavity in my tooth i dont know the word in english for caries. I stopped smoking. I went to the dentist, it wasnt that, she cleaned my teeth, but i was feeling like my four frontal teeth are moving, she said they dont move but i feel it. She said i have bruxism so maybe its that, but i literally cant eat because i feel that movement and it driving me nuts. I used to wear braces when i was a teenager, now days i need them again, and i cant look at the mirror. I want to go back in time. Im crying all day, i dont eat, i constantly think about killing myself because thats just my life, everything goes the worst way it can go since always. I dont have money to go to therapy, i tried to talk to people but they dont take me serious and say i should stop bother them. My boyfriend really tried to make me feel better but nothing worked and i knew he felt frustrated and i think angry because of the way i talk, so i started to act like everything is ok. Today my mom said i was skinny and i felt like crying because i know it is because i feel so terrible. I used to love my teeth, they were the only thing i liked about myself, i used to love smiling, now Im crying all day, feeling stressed, thinkin about killing myself. If Im alive today its just because I dont want to make my boyfriend sad and I dont want to leave my dog without me because he would miss me and nobody would take care of him or love him like i do. Please help me. I dont know what to do and i have no one to talk about.",

    "Is it just me, or when depressed, is it better to make yourself sad than to be numb? Bit of backstory here. So Ive been Depressed for six months, just that slow train that you cant hop off of. So it always starts with Numbness, and because every time I feel happy, I can still feel the numbness underneath, I dont trust it. So I listen to sad songs, and my triggers, so that I can feel anything besides numbness. Does anyone else do this? Or am I just crazy?",
    "How does therapy start? Hello fellow redditors! I have been suffering from depression and suicidal thoughts since I was a teenager. I have often theorized if therapy could help but actually going there was always out of question for a variety of reasons. I have read what therapy is supposed to give you no cure, but a more endurable existence? but never how one goes about the whole thing. How do you choose a therapist? Do you just walk in and just start talking about all the bad things? I have never confided in anyone so it just seems more than obscure to just walk in and tell a stranger that I want to kill myself because there is no purpose to it all anyways... I appreciate any feedback!",

    "Anyone else get upset with the way people compare your problems with there's like it's just that easy to get over it? Honestly one of the things Ive never really known how to deal with is having my problems under minded. Either in a it wasnt like that way like Im being over dramatic or in a so what we all go through shit type of way. And Im sure that sounds selfish to hear as we all go through stuff and dont get it twisted Im not saying Ive gone through more. Its just like I wish the people in my life would take action and show me that they care instead of bringing up there experiences. Because that doesnt work with me, I guess its kind of selfish but I just wish I could get a hug, or a damn bro or a hey lemme show you something type thing and go on a long walk or something yah know? This whole comparison thing to me just comes off in uncaring fashion. Like since you got over it I should to, its just not that easy for me so dont make it out like it is you know?",
    "I just want to stop existing Im terrified of death and not knowing what comes after it, but I dont see life as something precious or valuable. All I see is suffering and endless hopelessness. I am losing interest in everything and I can feel myself slipping away. Its been like this for so long I dont know what happiness feels like and I spend my days drifting in a mixture of self loathing and numbness. Im so tired and find sleep to be my only escape. School on top of my struggling really exhausts me mentally and physically. Im scared to die, but falling asleep for a really long time just sounds so nice. Even then though, Id have to wake up and face the cruel reality that there really isnt anything to be happy about. And it hurts because I cant escape it. No matter how many nights I spend trying to cry the pain away its still there. I have no motivation to really change my life either though, I physically cant force myself no matter how much I want to, to do anything productive. I dont know how much longer I can do this, does anybody know what to do? Im overflowed with these feelings and I cant help but feel the only way to get some release besides sleep is to harm myself, even if I know its not going to help in the end. Im just done and I cant keep up with school or my relationships anymore. I need some advice on what to do",
    "I feel constantly lonely and as though I’m hated by everyone Ive been feeling this way since I started year 7 and it has been constantly eating at me. I always have a persistent feeling that my friends arent actually there because they like me but rather because they feel bad for me or pity me. I havent ever gotten properly close to girls in fear they will hurt me which is a fear that derived from my past experiences with my stepmum and my real mum. And even if people assure me they care and are there for me, I always feel like they secretly hate me and theyre planning to hurt me or theyre talking about me behind my back. I usually just sit on my bed and cry about these problems and have been having many thoughts that the world would be better without me. I managed to tell my dad I felt worthless but his response was thats normal at your age and youll feel better soon, just speak to people but I cant bring myself to speak to people out of fear of them hating me or me inconveniencing them. Im really unsure of what I can do, and I feel lost, and all these feelings and emotions have only strengthened since lockdown started as I havent spoken to people much and have been alone all the time. And a experience that only strengthened this feeling of loneliness was last night when I was in a call with my friends but they ignored me every time I spoke and I think they forgot I was even there. Im sorry if this is kinda weird or sounds like a rant or if it doesnt make sense, Im just trying to type it up but my head is being weird and my thoughts are fuzzy and I just feel so tired",
    "I got into rpg commu to escape reality but It made my depression got worse. Im 22 years old who currently struggling with film thesis in my senior year. My thesiss topic is hard and its stressing me out. And I found this community where you draw a character and roleplaying with others character in some sort of setting like MMORPG. So I decided to use it to escape from some stress from my works. But it turned worsen. I have no friends there and its like everyone is knowing each other. I know the fact that I didnt active much because of my works and Im kind of confident in my drawing and painting skill Im parttime freelance artist. But nobody played with me or make their character talk to mine. I got anxious so I tried to please everyone by praising their characters in introduction posts or asking for our interactions of our own chars. Some didnt reply my message. In the last 5 days, I got sleepy entire day, lost an appetite, I only ate a small meal or snack once in a day and insomnia. I felt left out. So I brought my account to follow their public account with feeling that If I befriend with them maybe theyll be interact with me ? Some of them turned out fine. But theres one who seemed to hate me because stupid me had bad choice of words when complimented their char. At first, they didnt know Im the owner of that char, they seemed happy enough but once they knew the truth, they seemed off and didnt talk to me since. I know its stupid to give a damn about mimicking world where those members came from wherever in the world. But its so stressing when you feel like talking to a brick and everyone treats you like an air. Please say something, I really need support",
    "No matter what I think I feel like I can't stop myself from suicide Ive spent so much time thinking about killing myself, even had dreams where I have put a gun to my head and pulled the trigger. Just every time Im thinking I drift towards thoughts of suicide. I just dont see the purpose in anything at all. Every time I try to think myself out of it I just fall back into thoughts of suicide again. Like the finishing thought behind all my thoughts is suicide and nothing else matters. I just feel like unless I kill myself Ill just be here waiting to kill myself until I finally do it. At this point Im not even sad anymore, Im just THAT tired of being alive. I have nothing to gain from continuing to live, Id rather just be at eternal peace after death over each day being wasted time after time after time again. I dont know what to do. Love is the only thing that I could imagine that could pull me away from these thoughts but then theres nobody who loves me, or understands me or wants to spend each day together. So Im just left lonely and at that Id rather have been dead.",

    "My breakup is killing me That was a week ago, the same day she broke up with me in fact, its kind of the reason why we got into the fight responsible for our breakup. After that, I trained every day, thinking itd help me lose weight. But in fact, while I lost 1.5kg within a week, almost half of that was apparently muscle mass. I found out about that yesterday. Now I dont even want to train anymore. In the last few weeks, I found myself repeatedly contemplating passive suicide, as in, it wouldnt be so bad if I drove recklessly and that killed me some day, wouldnt it? Now, I feel like I actually want to die. She had issues, and sometimes those issues really annoyed the hell out of me. But who doesnt have those? I feel stupid for losing her and I feel like I wont ever be able to forgive myself. I was ready to marry this girl, but I lost her, due to my own stupidity. I wont ever find another woman like her again, I know that for certain, and I hate myself for it. I would do anything to get back with her, but she has made it clear that shes not interested in me anymore. Now I know that she will go on tons of tinder dates, kiss other guys, have sex with other guys, maybe in our shared bed and its killing me inside. Is it jealousy? Purely hormonal? I hope it is because if this feeling goes on, I think Im actually going to try something. Im not in therapy, I know I should be, but my depression is making it hard to actually get a therapist. Not to mention that usually youll have to wait a few months until theres a vacant spot. Please help me",

Taking meds for mental problems isnt normal form them. Eventually I had enough of their trash talk and gave it up. I regret it since then my symptoms are getting worse and worse.

Opposite shifts, gruelingly long hours and weeks, and extreme pandemic depression. I have been a neat freak since I got out on my own, and he was always a little messy, but could clean up after himself. I was to the point where I was considering ending my life. We hate our jobs, but we cant do anything that pays better right now, we make okay money. We both work 12 hours a day. Our house is in disarray. I lived with a hoarder for years, and it didnt ever feel this bad. Dirty dishes, halffull pizza boxes, trash, our bedroom floor is basically just water bottles at this point. We are both trying to turn it around. Its so overwhelming. If we could get it clean, we could keep up with it. Its just the two of us, and were half dead from work every single day. We get to see each other one day a week. I wish I could just hire someone to help us, but its too messy. I couldnt imagine hiring someone and letting them see how bad our home is.

I did everything i could to rack up as much debt as possible. Started ignoring all my friends and parts of my family whom i used to be really close with. I stopped taking care of my rented apartment and myself. So basically Im living in a web of lies. All of this was basically to make it easier to kll myself. But i now realized i cant do it because it would destroy my mother, brother and sisters.. i know they love me and would do anything for me to make me feel better. But its easier to lie and say everything is fine and avoid talking about feelings. So now Im stuck...

    "I just someone to hold me. I don’t know anymore. Its been a month since my partner of 10 years left me out of no where on my birthday. Just had their bags packed and said Im leaving. I have no closure and still dont even know what happened. She was physically and emotionally abusive to me but never told anyone about it on account of how emasculating it feels. I dont know how you tell people your female partner punches you at home during arguments. She begged me to go to therapy for years and started to with covid, I worked so hard to become a better person and mentally healthy and she hated that version of me. Now Im a waste of life in their 30s with no reason to live. She took all my friends with her and I just dont have anyone anymore. I drove cross country to be with family to try to sort myself out, but was quickly reminded why I dont spend much time with my family as its only made my mental health worse. I was happier alone with my dog in my car with no where to go or anything. Ive stopped taking my medication and have been drinking heavily, which I hadnt done for a year really. I took my last Ativan today and its been the only thing keeping me from going off the deep end. I doubt my psychiatrist will prescribe more so it just seems like the end to me. I think for some people suicide is their lifes purpose and I feel like I am finally becoming content with that. But I cant even talk like this openly with my therapist or psychiatrist out of fear of just being committed. I know my self and know I will just lie to get out of there too and will only drive me further to killing myself. I just dont understand why people I thought loved me want to hurt me so badly. I guess I just have bad karma and have done something to deserve this so I feel like nature is just telling me its time to die. I dont expect any one to respond or even read this.

    "I don't know what to do I just graduated from high school recently and I thought that would help with all my anxiety but Im just sitting in my room feeling lifeless. I dont sleep or eat regularly, and I barely know the time. The past 5 years have been really difficult for me, and Ive only had 2 people to talk to, one being a school counsellor. I think they just prolonged whatever I have but nothing really helps. I stopped having constant suicidal thoughts since 3 months ago, but it was so sudden and I just feel this lethargic tiredness always lurking. I dont know if its residual or its because everythings physically taking a toll on me. Even when everything I thought was giving me stress was over, nothing changed. And I have been trying to go out and meet my friends. Ive been out of my house more these days than most of my life combined. I thought whatever I was feeling might have been situational but I dont think it is. Ive tried swallowing pills a bunch of times and hurting myself and nothing happened, so I took that as a sign to try to be more healthy, but its not really working. I felt completely fine and then a few weeks ago I took 24 colored pills and thought maybe something would happen, and I just ended up with nausea and a stomach ache. Thats not normal, is it? I even took cough syrup with it. I dont get how nothing can happen, and I really dont get why Im still doing these things when Im not under stress which is usually the only reason I would hurt myself when it all started. I cant meet a paid professional because my parents wouldnt ever believe me. Theyre not bad people but theyre ignorant and misguided, and that mental illnesses only exist for people with real trauma. Theyd say I was lying or faking it. And believe me, Ive tried approaching the topic with them. I had 2 panic attacks in front of them and they still wouldnt let me meet a mental health counsellor even when we went to the hospital and the doctor recommended it. Whats wrong with me?

I have no real experience with depression but i know i cant heal it for her and that she has no control over it. However i dont love her less for that. I just want to be there for her and comfort her the best i can. Sadly therapy is not available for her at the moment. So im trying to gather as much information as i can to be there for her. I know everyone has a different experience with depression and everyone needs different things when they are down. However i would like to ask you to share your experience what helps you and what you like other people or specifically your partner to do to be helpful. Thanks a lot.",
    "Afternoon Anxiety and Depression For the past couple of months I have had really bad anxiety and depression at night. I have been dealing with both for years now, almost I think since middle school, Im 27 now. However, since August of last year, when I had my first and only anxiety attack, I was out with my friends and my anxiety got so bad that I had force them to call me an uber so I could just go home and sleep it off. I told myself and my parents that if I didnt feel better in the morning, I was going to the hospital. I never felt that bad in my life and I have been worried about it happening again. There are a lot of stressful things going on in my life right now, somethings that I think maybe life changing, but I cant be sure until the time comes and it might be sooner then later. I can elaborate if you guys want, but its a long story. I feel fine in the morning, I feel great in the morning. Im very positive and eager to get things done. It hits me around 3 or 4 pm. Something will trigger it that will cause me to think negative thoughts and it will affect me the rest of the night, but if I had that same thought at like 9 am, I would shrug it off and think, something like It not happening now, so dont worry about it. It has ruined a lot of things for me. Going out with friends is now dreadful. I used to look forward to hanging out with people, but now I would rather stay at home. My sleep schedule is going to bed as early as possible because I cant stand the anxiety. It even stops me from doing chores, I drop everything and want to sleep. It seems like ever since I had the anxiety attack, this has been happening every night. Am I subconsciously worrying about having another panic attack? What can I do to help ease my thoughts. I would love to go out with my friends again without feeling this way. I am seeing a Psychologist and taking meds at the moment. Insurance sucks, so a therapist would cost me 70 and I dont have the money for it and money is probably my biggest anxiety factor.",
    "Am I a sociopath...? This is a throwaway account. So, I have been struggling with depression for quite some time now, and I am very very concerned that I may be beginning to show sociopathic tendencies. I have a friend, who, for anonymities sake, shall remain nameless. He is my best friend, and has been for a long time. But lately, I have noticed that I feel almost like I want to know everything he does and when he does it, and he is part of a group that I recently left, and is, in fact,in a leadership position there. I left for several accumulative reasons, but one of them was because since he was in a leadership position, we where not able to converse at the group. It was hard for both of us, but we tried to follow the rules. After I left, I started having trouble with the nights that the meetings where taking place, like it was hard for me to accept the he was still there and I wasnt. Im also noticing that when we have something planned and he backs out because of, for example, work, I find that I am way more bothered by that than I should be. So, am I a sociopath, and what can I do to stop these tendencies? Thanks in advance. Tim not my real name, of course",
    "It's not getting better.. Please listen and dont downvote me. Ive been facing severe depression and anxiety for about 8 years now. Needless to say, its been dreadful. I finally sought professional help in the form of psychiatrist. Turns out his meds made things worse. Then after some years, I thankfully found a good psych who did make a difference. The difference is this I became more functioning. Thats it. The inner turmoil is still very much there. Ive been to multiple therapists Mind you, were talking about the most well renowned and expensive therapists in my region but it just made no positive change at all. We went at lengths to discuss and dissect me and my life and my behaviors and my emotions. All this analysis increased my overthinking to the point that now my mind constantly thinks and is aware of each and everything. Like hey you did this because of xyz feeling. Its painfully exhausting. Its like a constant 247 commentary in my mind, which was fueled by the therapy. After each therapy session, I felt ashamed, guilty, and worthless. So much negativity about me. Reinforcing the idea that there is something gravely wrong with me. Never did I feel validated at therapy. Never was I told what I can do to feel better. It was like talking to a mirror. Just reflecting back what I said. Which quite frankly, I dont need to hear as my mind has been chattering all those things for years now. I am very lost, confused, hurt and hopeless now. I cannot find any solution. What can I do..",
    "I miss enjoying my hobbies For a while now, Ive had very low energy and motivation to do things I used to love. Reading, drawing, painting, playing the piano... I just dont have interest in engaging in my hobbies anymore. But I want to be able to enjoy them again! Ive tried scheduling time to do some of these things each week, but it has just made me dread doing them even more, as if they were more chores. Im interested to hear what techniques and skills worked for you to be able to enjoy life again.",

    "Does it ever get better? I hope with all my heart that life gets better. That I am escape the isolation and depression, but I just lack sufficient evidence. I want to believe you can change your life, but are there really any success stories? Can someone truly comeback from the brink? I cant withstand the sexless loneliness, isolation, intimacy deprived existence I live. Im in school and I know what I want to do but its a very, very slim margin I make it. Im couch surfing and scrounging by. Nothing looks good right now. Sometimes I feel like the universe is punishing me, like some kind of evil synchronicity, it just keeps showing me things I cant have or baiting me into positive change only to take it all away, just to twist the knife. Does it ever get better?",
    "I have always been the \"supportive\" and \"strong\" friend, but now I'm losing it... All my life Ive tried to do the right thing. I usually give counsel to my closest friends without asking for something in return. I am the strong, the one who never gets sad or has emotional issues. Nevertheless, I am losing it. I am tired of being strong I am tired of appearing happy all the time I do it for them, not because I am in the good mood all the time. My family does not know it either, but I have to go on with my life for they need me. I am tired of loving everybody without receiving a portion of that love. I learned to love my loneliness, but now it feels like I need someone, but finding a partner who wants something serious is extremely hard and I am not a Greek god, to be honest. I do not like dependency, however, Id love to have someone to talk to besides my friends. I lost my best friend last year since I fell in love with her dont do it, worst idea ever. Does anybody feel this way? Does anyone go through the same thing?",
    "Stuck between moving forward and killing myself Some background information My GF of almost 3 years broke up with me over half a year ago and ever since I have been severely depressed. It wasnt a bad breakup, just a sad one. Shortly after the breakup, I noticed I wasnt dealing with it well at all. I couldnt do anything but cry and wishing she would come back. I went to a psychologist and he diagnosed me with Major Depressive Disorder MDD. I still had friendly contact with my ex, but I was just hoping she would come back. After an emotional call, she told me to take a few months for myself. And so I did, but I just got worse. I couldnt do anything. I stopped working, studying, playing sports, everything, because I had no energy or motivation for it. I almost got admitted to a psych ward, but it was still my choice to do stay there or not. I chose to not do it as I had a bad feeling about it. October of last year, I contacted her again and we met for the first time in months. It was supposed to just be friendly, but talking about the relationship was inevitable. She said to me she would never take me back. She wasnt angry, but just serious and honest. It broke me even more. The next day I sent her a goodbye text and was close to killing myself. She called just in time and we had a good talk. Though a few weeks later, when things look better and we actually had made plans to meet up as friends, I got a panic attack and sent her emotional texts. She sent me a long one back and then blocked me. I then attempted suicide again, this time getting hospitalized. I have not directly spoken to her since. It was either via other people or letters. Last December I sent her a suicide letter, but I quickly regretted it. My brother sent her a message for me, apologizing to her and telling her Im okay. Then for Christmas, I sent her a simple card, but never got a response nor did I expect one to be honest.",
    "I am very lonely and my house mate bangs his girlfriend every day behind my wall. I am 39, trying to cope with my depression. It was triggered by being alone for 2 years, after 9 year long relationship. I am frustrated as fuck and my hose mate fucks his sexy girlfriend every day in the next room. I am dying inside. I am well built, smart, have passions and interesting job but still cant make any connections with women. But I would be able to live with that, maybe even fix it, but now I am locked with two horny people in one house and I want to blow my brains out. metaphorically speaking so far. Headphones help a bit, but its not only about noises as you guys might guess. I cant stand their happiness, it just reminds me of what I am missing out on. I cant be happy for them, and it only makes me think worse about myself. They are looking for a new place but it might take months. Same for me if I want to move out. I am scared of loneliness. I need some sex but it dose not work for me with prostitutes. I tried Tinder and other stuff, no real results and I am loosing hope with every day passing. I mean I am now talking to a bunch of strangers on the internet to flush some of my frustration away and get advice. I started therapy but it is too early to say if it helps. I dont want to be swallowed by this demon but it is chewing on me for some time now. Maybe you guys can help me out... Ill try anything to get better.",

I have literally no motivation and dont wanna leave my bed but I feel like I have too. I fucking hate the fact that no one takes me seriously or tells me youre fine just because Im 14. Ive been diagnosed with severe recurring depression and moderate anxiety, and yet I feel like its just considered a fucking joke. My life is tearing me in half and so many time I just wish I could find something to do ore motivate me to do something. Honest to god I felt like I feel for a girl really hard and it seemed like things were going well but it seems like she lost interest but still leads me in acting like she wants something to happen but nothing ever does, I have to maintain every conversation and It just weighs me down.

I just wanna lay in bed with music blasting in my ears so I can forget the world exists. I barely get any hours of sleep anymore, I dont like talking to my parents about anything regarding this because they have no idea how to treat it, and they know my Reddit so Im honestly scared to post this because I dont want them to worry about me because it makes it worse. I just want people to listen to me, I dont want your advice unless I ask for it and just I dont know, I wish everything would just slow down, I wish I could have a best friend, I wish I could find just someone to be there constantly, where we can have fun all the time and just enjoy talking. Im really close to giving up and feel like Im to open with shit.

    "Someone to talk to My lifes going downhill rn and I do not have a single person to talk to, I cant cry or anything, pretty numb all of it. I just feel like I could burst any moment, I know its my fault that I dont have anyone to talk to but it hurts a lot knowing that Im pretty much alone at this point, I might not even make it. Only thing keeping me alive was a quick extreme manic episode where i was going insane. Now I just feel empty inside, my brain thinks its good this way and justifies all the things that are happening. Constant intrusive thoughts in my head and I feel like Im on a bad drug trip. This isnt really important, I just feel like venting a little bit. I might just force myself back into an extremely overly happy mindset and just distract myself as much as possible. Basically what Im trying to ask how does one cope with being alone? How do you deal with feelings when you cant talk about any of it?

Been to a couple therapists over the years but never really had any successfound one he could connect to. The few meds he tried made him worse. He holds it together pretty well most times. But when he drops he pushes everyone away, yells, and gets very defeatist it hurts. I often find myself saying and doing the wrong things and making it worse. I have the kids go to their room and be quiet. Sometimes I get mad at his behavior until it sinks in what his brain is doing. I apologize but it doesnt take the pain away. I dont know how to help him. I suggest therapy but he poo poos me. Hes getting worse and Im worried. Advice welcomed.",

    "Breaking up gave me depression.. and I want to speak my mind.. please be nice. I did not think I would end up this way. Drowning in selfpity in my room creating a post on Reddit because I cant express how I feel to anyone. Im just hoping this venting post could make me feel slightly better. Im not looking for pity, I just needed to speak out my mind. It was a 4year relationship, I broke up December 2019, Its been months. Ive done all I can, move to a new country, try a new sport, meet new people, and many more. I cant say that things did not get better in time, because it did. Time heals all. It helped me move on and lose most of my feelings for her, but it left a pretty nasty scar on me. So if time heals, whats the problem?? I dont wanna be a whiny prick, because we all go through breakups, and my situation is certainly not harder than anyones situation in this world. I just need a place where I can speak out my mind and not be judged. I dated a girl that I idolized, I see her for the angel that shes not. I was blinded by my feelings, and I see that now. Dont get me wrong, she was wonderful, loving, caring, and it just didnt work out. Around August 2019, we moved from our hometown to different countries for University We started an LDR. After our 4th year of dating, she started changing. Id like to believe that it was the people that she surrounded herself within University because I have never seen her act this way. When November 2019 came, she started doing something that ruined me. She would go out drinking and kept it from me, she also started ghosting me for days. I was not used to being ghosted because, throughout our 4 years of dating, she has never done that. And really, being ghosted by her ruined me so much. I started getting panic attacks. Initially, It was once every two weeks, then it became once a week, then it became 23 times a week. Eventually, she broke it off in December 2019.",
    "All the careers I want are way too hard to get into I26m have been struggling with depression since I started university. I got my MA in poli sci in 2019 and my mental health took a downward turn for the worse since. Ive just been unemployed and struggling with suicidal thoughts since then. I feel like this in large part because all the careers I truly want to get into are basically too competitive for me to get into. I would specially like to be a high school teacher, physician, police officer or work in the civil service but I live in Ontario and all those jobs are way too competitive to get into. I havent really tried because I dont think Ill even get an interview. It sucks because I need to get a decent job to move forward in life but I dont want to keep living if Ill never get a career I actually want. Im changing antidepressants and seeing a really good therapist but I dont think I can change anymore. I suffered so much in and after university just to be little further ahead. What should I do?

    "High functioning depression Hi everyone, Ive been lurking in depression subreddits for a while but I finally decided to post. I have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and clinical depression. I was diagnosed when I was 17 but since I started university my depression has become more high functioning, and there have been times when people do not believe me when I open up about my depression. Even when I talked about my PTSD from a sexual assault and a mentally abusive relationship, some people did not believe me. I shower two times a day every day, I finish all my assignments a week ahead of time and I make sure I get near perfect grades on everything, I work 56 days a week, Im a clean freak who has to do laundry and dishes every single day or else I panic. My anxiety disorder screams at me to get these things done or else my anxiety will eat me alive. Ive had people who tell me my depression isnt real because their depression had them unable to leave their bed. When I talked about my struggles with suicidal thoughts I was skirted to the side and seen as a liar, while someone else was praised for their struggles because they were unable to continue going to college due to their depression. I felt like screaming that depression is not a contest. It ruins lives and there is no one size fits all depression. I just need support that my struggles are valid.",
    "I'm not clincally depressed (hasn't be confirmed) but.. I honestly feel like I should die and Im a mistake, before you suggest it, I told my mom. She tried to be supportive but I feel no better, its gone on for long. Since I was 57. Im honestly sick of faking being happy, I dont know what more to do. Why I wouldnt kill myself Im afraid of death, and even if I wasnt, theres nothing I could use. Im probably too young anyways, thats probably why my mom shrugged it off. Why I want to kill myself First off, I have trouble getting to sleep, I hardly wake up in the night, its just hard for me to get asleep. My mom has taken notice of that too. Over tired she calls it. Also, Im super lonely, I have no friends, the only place I have friends is on the internet, but theyre not on much, and when they are, IM the one giving support. I get they have problems too, but I gave up so long ago. Im also so scared of so many things. Falling into the sky, on a wallthe ceiling, that is a big problem for me when I look up in the sky or look up when Im lying down. It just scares me, it doesnt affect my sleeping, but other ascepts. Failure. Nobody likes failure right? Its worse for me. Im scared of failure because I feel if I fail then nobody would like me, they would ignore me more, I would be more alone. I know its not true, I just cant escape that fear. Sorry if this is too long, Ive just been holding this in so long.",
    "Just need to talk to anyone So I have been a part of this subreddit for idk how long, but never posted anything because I felt like my problems are not important. But now I want to post something. I actually have typed this post out several times this week but always ended up deleting it. I dont want to be a burden to anyone. Im gonna start with what happened today. This story has nothing bad happening but it caused me mental pain. Im typing this out because the four hours I spent with my fiancé has been the longest I have felt happy this week and I just need to talk to anyone right now. Me and my fiancé went to the gym this morning. He had to pick me up due to we both still with our parents and havent told anyone about our engagement we want to surprise them and are waiting to by financial set. We went to the gym worked out for an hour or two then we went out to do some errands. I was bringing my resume to places applied to and my fiancé was my ride. After that he got on the freeway and we were just driving and making jokes. I was telling him a funny story about a quest I did in a game Im playing. Then I got a phone call from my mom. She wanted to know where I was and when Im going to be back. Now I know this is seems like a red flag but she only asked because she had to get a new work uniform and my other siblings were going with her and no will be home. That doesnt seem bad but my moms stepdad lives with us and he is unable to much he can walk and stuff but has a hard time remembering things. So someone has to be home with him. I said ok and we started to head back. This when I noticed that my fiancé was upset. I asked whats wrong, it turns out that he had a surprise for me. He was taking to a sushi place that he promised to take a while back. He also had plans for the whole day for us but wanted to surprise me with it. I started feeling like I ruined the whole day. His plans and the way he described it made it sound like today was gonna be the most perfect dateday.",

It all started last year when I got laid off from my job at Disney due to covid, and the transition to online school. Ever since March of last year Ive been in my room all alone, my family worries and its so rare I leave my room sometimes they think I went out to eat.

    "I think I'm severely depressed and I don't know how to fix it. First things first I created this account because I dont feel comfortable using my regular one, and this is the first post Im making with it, but Ive been a Redditor for the better part of a decade. Please dont hold my desire to remain anonymous against me. Thank you. Now that thats out of the way, heres why Im posting Im a 45yearold guy and only now have realized that Im just sitting around waiting to die. Most people wouldnt know that by looking at me though, because on the surface Im a happy, friendly, outgoing person, but on the inside I just feel empty and hopeless. I cant sleep, Ive overeaten to the point of morbid obesity, I have no friends, my relationship with my wife feels distant, I dont get out and go anywhere, I dont exercise, I have no career ambitions even though I have a steady job, and I just generally have given up on everything and I feel like Im just going through the motions. Its been like that for years. I lost my dad in the 90s, my mom died 12 years ago, my fatherinlaw died a year after that, my brother has stopped speaking with me, I broke my leg a few years ago and it never healed back as well as I wish it had, I hurt all of the time, and my quality of life has plummeted. I know I need to seek help, but I dont know how to go about it without feeling like a failure. The idea of medication repulses me, and opening myself up to a total stranger seems like a nonstarter, so I dont know what I should do. As a result, Ive done nothing, and my health is only getting worse. If anyone has ever been in shoes like mine, how did you fix the problem? What did you do to change? How can I even get motivated to seek help and support when I cant even motivate myself to exercise, eat healthy, or talk about stuff like this with my wife? I just feel like Im surrounded by dead ends and all I can do is fake it until death finally solves my problems for me.",

    "Am I to blame for my boyfriends depression? Me and my boyfriend have a really good relationship most of the time. We want the same things and are usually very in sync, until we have a minor disagreement. To me they are mainly about trivial things like chores, but they always escalate because of how we both act. I get frustrated and either get angry and shout or really upset and cry. He just leaves, actually packs up his bags and leaves home. This happened again yesterday and he left. He came to pack his stuff today and after begging him he eventually opened up to me. He said he feels like a shadow of himself with work, friends, family and that he feels so much better away from me. He said some nasty things yesterday but this was really what he thought, and it really hurt me. Ive been doing some research and think he is depressed, I managed to get him to agree to get help today and said i would give him space for a couple of weeks while hes basically said hes seeing if hes better without me.

    "Trying to figure out \"why\"? Im 23, male, born and raised in a middle class family in a first world country. No serious traumas Im aware of, only thing I can think of is not having an emotionally available father. Thats about all I have to complain about. Family history  both my parents and lots of cousins are on depression medication. I was on it for around a year until I tapered off. I grew up with no reason to be depressed but from around age 1213 to now 10 years I have been getting more depressed, anxiety and anhedonia. What went wrong in my brain during my developmental years? Is this purely hereditary? Was I destined to be depressed due to some predisposition from my parents genetics? Its so frustrating I want to give up. Ive tried medication, therapy, meditation, excercise, CBT. Im overwhelmed",
    "I wish I had someone to talk to that understands what im going thru Im 17 and ive been extremely depressed the last couple of months and am just completely lost and with no idea what to do. I used to have goals, aspirations and things to work towards but everything has just faded and over this summer holidays ive just felt completely disconnected to everything. Ive had depression for 6 years now and have been able to temporarily solve my problems but it would always come back worse, and i have no idea what has caused it this time, especially considering ive been on summer holidays which by a landslide my favourite part of the year. Im starting year 12 tommorow and am scared that not only because of all this im going to fail and waste my opportunities, but the extra load of 68 hours of school a day is just going to completely destroy me on top everything else happening.

    "I don’t want to be dead, but I don’t want to face the future either. Its not that my future is hopeless. I could be successful, I could live comfortably, if I invested my fucking soul into medical school like it seems I might. But when I think about the next few years of my life, I dont want to handle it. I dont want to live through it. I dont really want anything from my future. When it gets like this, I would rather have nothing. I cant see the value in any of the struggle and the pain and suffering. They say that you can still enjoy life even if it is a struggle, but I cant see that happening. I cant see a payoff to all of it. Especially if it keeps going like it has been.

    "Is it possible to survive a breakup having drepression? Ive been struggling with anxiety and depression for the past two years. I became a jerk because of it and my ex left me 6 months ago but she wasnt sure. We havent seen each other in person since then it was a long distance relationship, so that was expected. I tried to become a better person, I started therapy and meds Lexapro 2 weeks ago. But two days ago she sent me an email telling me she doesnt love me anymore, that shes happy without me as a partner. She also told me to stop sending her messages until I move on, that our relationship is over, but she would like to be friends some day. She sounded so condescending and harsh, she also had depression and anxiety, but she started getting better before leaving me. My hope is gone, she forgot about me so quickly now that shes not depressed when a year ago she told me she could love me forever... I doesnt matter anymore. She sees me as a problem in her past. Im so hurt and so desperate rn... Im stuck with her memories and its all my fault. 6 months like this. I dont deserve anyone. Im so tired of this feelings, I cant enjoy life anymore and Im sure my friends are tired of me being sad. I dont deserve them either. I want to kill myself or make it stop. Did you survive this?",
    "Anyone here have reverse seasonal affective disorder - i.e.: summer depression? If so, could use some advice It took me months to recover Bc I couldnt find any type of add on medication that I could tolerate that helped. During these spells I literally feel as if Im drugged  I am searching for words, I have no energy. I feel as if Im literally impaired or like I have taken a sedative. I understand it must sound dramatic, but Ive not been able to find anything medication wise that is able to help. I had a gene site test and Ive tried the meds listed in my green bucket and the side effects were so intense I couldnt continue on them, not to mention theyre not covered by our insurance so we paid over 1500.00 last summer on meds that didnt work. I find it difficult to find other people who have this and especially difficult to convey to my prescribing Dr. what Im going through. Additionally, I dont understand why it just happened so recently and without much warning like cause and effect. I have had depression most of my adult life and have been able to manage it with medication and lifestyle changes, but this summer thing is a different animal. Now its June and Im hoping that I can do some prevention as I feel like Ive exhausted meds. options. I have an appointment with my provider this week and I need to be as pro active as I can now in case I have this experience again. I just dont know what to ask for at this point, nor what to even do  or if I even have to do anything. Maybe it wont happen  I mean anything is possible, but I feel like I need to at least try to be prepared. Anyone have experience with this and any tips? I am thinking of preparing myself for a ketamine infusion or something this year. I just cannot imagine going through it again Bc it lasted so long this past summer well into the fall and I got to the point of being so low it was scary. A Dr I see occasionally suggested planning a vacation during the time when I usually feel this come on  sounds good, but also  could be a train wreck. Anyway  anything would be helpful.

    "My mom said I'm faking depression Hey everyone, Ive never posted here but I hope youre all well. I really need some advice if you have any. I go to one of the top universities in North America and am currently in my 5th year. These past 2 years have had me feeling really low and Ive been thinking about seeing a therapist because I may have depression. I feel very demotivated and tired even though my work load is insane and I cant afford to slack. Often times I feel very worthless, a burden, and a waste of space. I also binge eat which makes those feelings worse. The eating has gotten a LOT better but it still had its moments. Anyway, Ive been wanting to sew a therapist but I need insurance which had been kind of holding me back. My dads insurance covers the whole family I live at home, for cultural reasons but he and my mom would be able to see who uses it. After a year, the feelings got worse and I made the decision, after much deliberation, to tell my mom that I would like to see a therapist and that I would like to use the insurance. She said okay and j started looking but most were fully booked or not taking new patients. Today, we were discussing my sisters divorce. Her ex had depression and was one of the reasons they got a divorce. My mom says that anyone who has depression shouldnt get married, and that it applies to me. She said that she thinks Im faking it for attention because its not visible to her. She said if I do think I have it, I should forget about finding love or getting married. I interpreted her words to mean that people it depression are unworthy of love and that I would ruin someones life like my sisters ex ruined hers. I dont know, the feelings are kind of intense right now and I dont want to cry but theres a lump in my throat and I just want to sleep but I have a huge midterm tomorrow and I have to see her later and my sister is of no help Sorry for the rant",

Ive been all my life thinking I had a great future ahead as I was a betterthanaverage student, my parents let me choose the career I wanted even if it was an economic riskIm majoring in arts, went through college very competently, got good grades but I also was inadvertently sabotaging myself. Ive been suffering from depression and anxiety since I was a teenager, my parents were told I might have a mental disorder such as an anxiety disorder or BPD. I went to a psychiatrist for a whole year but dropped out since I wasnt feeling any different and decided to instead focus on school. But being honest I never truly made an effort in school. Many professors told me I was talented but I was always so afraid to prove them wrong so I did no major projects. I kept avoiding major job opportunities since I thought those werent for me and I wasnt the right guy for them. My professional life had a shine of light at the beginning of 2020 as one of my projects was being financed, then the pandemic hit putting everything on hiatus, got no job of course, and had to go back to my parents. One year later everythings worse. Still jobless, still with my parents, procrastinating, hitting bottom every couple months, with 3 suicide attempts already, and just shitty thoughts every passing hour. My parents are sick of me even if they dont say it out loud. Im sick of myself. Im a fucking parasite too scared to do anything to change that. To move back to my apartment and find a job. To see how accomplished my friends are and seeing what theyve done in the past year and me thinking good for you mate, I just tried killing myself more than once haha. Im too ashamed. Im too old now. I see people being successful at 24 and Im 29 now and its too fucking late, still living off my parents is so humiliating. I cant shake away that feeling and Im so afraid one of these days that feeling turns unbearable and just end me without thinking it twice. Im done.",
    "Depression or just “messed up” Hi, Ever since I was 17 15 years ago my life has been crap. I had a long term boyfriend who treated me like crap for 12 years, lied to me, stole from me and was emotionally abusive to me. I had a child with him and finished with him 3 years ago. I then met someone, he was ok in the beginning but then he started purposely saying things to hurt me like saying Id be the worst person in the world to have a kid with, how hed never marry me, and also call me a fat ct Im not actually fat he apologised for all of that saying he only said it because he wanted to hurt me. but recently, hes started lying to me and then wed get in to a fight and hed say Im mentally sick and that Im really messed up and obviously have loads of insecurities. For the past 7 years Ive felt SO low! My mood changes so quickly, i get moody quite often, I am constantly doubting myself and after the recent lies from my current partner Ive come to realise I cant trust him or believe a word he says anymore. Ive also been having bad thoughts not so much suicidal, more that I think it would be so much easier for people if I just died In my head Ive put in place what would happen to my child if I did die. Am I depressed or just messed up from my past? Im so stubborn I dont want to talk to a doctor in fear they would laugh in my face and say Im just a waste of time. I dont want to speak to family in fear that they would pity me. I dont want to speak to friends because Id feel embarrassed. I cant talk to work because its such a stressful job theyd only worry that I may end up taking time off work! I dont know what to do anymore.",

Only the buprenorphine is on a script, the others were prescribed but cutoff about 4 years ago, since then Ive been using the darknet for the diazepam and pregabalin. It is proper medication sourced from spain, with leaflets everything I even sent some samples to Energy Control and they came back fine, 100 what it says on the box. Right now, my GP, my drugworker, my psych are all aware of this me buying illegally from the darknet and giving zero shits but I mentioned Im feeling suicidal to my drugworker pretty much as always, and a CRISIS team was told about it. They called and setup an appointment that I went to today. My worries are that in the past, ambulancepolice teams have turned up to my house and take all my illegal diazpregabs I have no illwill towards the cops, they have to. But it forces me through a 72hour withdrawal until I can place another order and see the psych team who just ask Are you suicidal?, are you going to kill youself today? No? Okay you can go.

    "Complete recovery after depression is a realistic expectation? I also got fired right before Christmas for sleeping too much at work and doing almost nothing because of my depression, but I wasnt even mad about it. I mean, I cried because crying was like my main occupation along with sleeping and because I knew thats what Im supposed to do when I get fired but I didnt really feel much about that event. In January I went in a trip to New York with one of my best friends and I enjoyed every moment of it! Then I came home and started looking for a new job. I was so relaxed and carefree and I was becoming my old self again. In February I started a new job and shortly after that I stopped my antidepressants treatment. But I feel like this journey of becoming my old self again is never going to be complete. Sometimes I get close to what I used to be before this whole thing but I cant sustain that, like the oldhappyme is visiting sometimes but she doesnt wanna stay. Even though things go great for me now great new job, great old friends, new healthy romantic relationship I am mostly anxious and scared. I cant be genuinely happy with the good things I have in my life, because the fear of losing them and going straight back into depression is overwhelming. I heard things like youll never go back to what you used to be before depression, depression leaves a scar youll have to live with your entire life, depression is a part of growing up, you just cant go back. I am starting to believe these things and its sad. Are they true? I have no chance to going back to my old self?",

    "Specific activities to ease loneliness and depression while living alone in the time of COVID? I 23F have been living alone since ending a 4year emotionally abusive relationship in October 2019. I loved my new independence, then quarantine hit. I went through another horrific breakup in March  he broke up with me in a truly cruel way the day before the shelterinplace order hit. My best friends have all moved 100s of miles away to be with their parents during quarantine. After 82 days of basically solitary confinement, I started hanging out safely with acquaintances in June and I visit my parents almost every weekend. Im trying dating apps, but the constant ghosting, mixed signals, and not getting matches is really bringing me down. I have had depression, anxiety, and OCD for 10 years but in quarantine its the worst Ive ever felt. I am an attractive woman, but no one wants to date me and everyone Ive ever dated has either been emotionally abusive or lied to me to get to my body. When I do meet someone who expresses interest, they inevitably ghost me. I just got a prescription for Zoloft because my Citalopram is clearly not working anymore. I am hoping to feel better on Zoloft, but I dont have much hope. A medication will not give me friends, or make men interested in me, or open up all my favorite places that have closed due to the pandemic. Because my depression stems from my unfortunate life circumstances, I am seeking advice on specific things I can do to pass the time and take my mind off of how sht my life is right now. Especially how I can meet other people and hopefully make friends. When everything that I love to do is closed, what can I do to make myself feel happy?

It fed into my already negative thoughts.... and I relapsed. Everything just spiralled down. I feel so ashamed I even showed him my depressed moment, telling him how negative I felt about myself and everything around me.

    "I feel depressed but feel like even more of a loser for feeling depressed. Sympathy always makes me feel guilty, really no matter what its about. Its been a cycle ive dealt with for years now and i dont know that its even boiling over into anything harmful to me on the outside but im tired of it bringing me down. Part of why its hard to talk about is because i can only imagine the eye rolls when hearing about some rich kid complain that hes struggling when people are probably in 10x worse situations than me. I get it. But I figured reddit is anonymous so if people think im a loser then who cares. I think if i told most people what im going through they would just say im an overworrier and overthinking, but at this point im tired of life just sucking. Im tired of relative failure my whole life. And like i said im tired of only being so good at putting negative thoughts about myself in the backburner and not allowing them back into my usual frame of mind. They just never fail to come back and haunt me. The only way i can continue push forward is to find some self worth. I dont even know why i came to this sub. I just thought about it and felt like it was an opportunity to let out some emotions that ive been holding for a long time now. Maybe as an opportunity to learn more about it because of my long reluctancy to ever face my depression head on and always dance around it and pretend to not let it affect me unless im in an environment where its safe to do so, which is just by myself. Thanks to anyone with any kind of insight, positive or negative. Ive tried to always be a realist with myself despite my issues in conjuring up some sense of self worth.",

    "I ( 26 female ) have decided to take care of my severely depressed younger brother (20m ) by letting him move in with me last week and need some tips. Moreover, I dont want his depression to trigger me and I dont want his negativity  not shaming him he is just very depressed and sick and needs help but his depression makes him so negative about everything  to bring me down, I want to keep pushing for a better life for myself and my brother without the negativty bringing me down as I worked so hard to get to a somewhat surface level healthy mindset  I say this because I.myself can get easily triggered and spiral if things feel to overwhelming especially when it comes to my family  ... It worries me because everything he says is a cognitive distortion and in life, as we know, you become the people you hang out with the most.. 4 . I want him.to become more resilient, I am not expecting a cure but I want him to be processing in the right direction not the other way around. 5. I also respect that he has a serious disease that needs medical attention and specialized  tailored followups. I want to be a good example to him... one that is different from my parents.. He has become like them . Negative about everything on top of having severe psychomotor retardation and lack of appetite  hence why I am am getting him to the doctor tomorrow . 6. He has been on antidepressants before but it wasnt good. He had more appetite but still didnt leave his room. Meds are not unknown to him. I believe tomorrow the doctors help will give us the best choices for him. 7. He is aware he is sick and even agrees he needs meds, we.watched a 50 min video by Dr. Sapolsky yesterday regarding how depression affects the brain and he realized just how affective depression is to the hypocampus etc... My brother knows he has congirive distortions most of the time. How do I keep him motivated to stay on track and improve slowly slowly day by day ?",
    "Heavy Shame From Drunken Past Starting around 2015, I tried to fix my depression with alcohol. Stupid, I know. Im sober and I think quite a lovely person now, but I cant stop remembering back then, and feeling this all consuming shame that makes me want to die. First instance, I was nervous aboutat a social gathering. I drank too much and dont remember everything, but I think I spoke to a poor, nice guy about Shakespeare and my dream of being a writer and god knows what for ages, and then I was just obnoxious. Not my shy self anymore. Talked loud. Tried to high five somebody who left me hanging because, well, you couldnt blame them. Just awful cringy. I did a semi burp, I think, which alerted my friends, who got me into the bathroom, and then I remember being half asleep in a chair, with that lovely guy trying to reassure me that I would be getting home soon. My mum eventually came and got me. I threw up in a bin outside, and was spouting Yeats poetry whilst stumbling with my mum and my friend holding me up. I cant stop remembering, and feeling this suicidal, heavy shame. Then, 2017, I met my boyfriend. Gorgeous human being. For maybe three out of the four years weve been together, Ive been a sporadic drunk. Drinking at home. Getting drunk. Crying my eyes out. Or angrily breaking up with him, selfsabotaging. Hes had to take the locks off all the doors so I dont do something stupid and he cant get in. One night, I even blanked out. I dont drink like that anymore, but I cannot stop thinking about how horrible it wouldve all been for him. I was so needy, horrible, greedy, drunk, and delusional. And no matter how much I apologise and try to make up for it, I still feel rotten. He keeps telling me to forget about it, not linger in that place, and that hes forgiven me, but how can he?",
    "Depressed Partner (quarantine) Hi! F29 M29 My partner of 2 years asked me for space on Thursday after his therapist appointment. He said he didnt want to make any rushed decision breakup until he had a more clear view of things. We had just moved in together in January and now he isnt sure if he was ready. He has been struggling with being stuck at home, no sports on tv, and me nagging him to get out of the house with me for walks or just even eating in our patio. I had no background or knew how to deal with depression so I cried and made him feel responsible for what he was feeling. He said he was confused and didnt know if the quarantine or our relationship where the real cause of his depression. I left but didnt even hug him. I made some research and felt so gulty of not being compassionate to him and went back on Friday to beg him to trust me. He said he still needed time but that everything I had said helped him. I stayed away but reading everything I could, joined TalkSpace which has helped me a lot and felt very connected with people going through the same thing. I slowly realized his illness made him so unworthy of love that he felt that me being out of his life would help him. I kept on sending text of encourganmet once a day and have food, essentials deliveries to the house the quarantine does not help. Today I came over in the morning and let our dog out and fed her. He was still in bed, I came in the room hugged him and reassured I would always be here. He had a drainedsad look on his face but hugged me back. I said I LOVE YOU and he could bearly get the words out. I then left..... I just need some help knowing things will pass. Ive done evrything I can and all left its to wait.

I was a social work student but I dropped out because it was emotionally draining. And across a lot of different areas of my life I need to cope with things. I feel defeated and ashamed of myself. I feel like I dream too big and cant attain those dreams. I feel pain from society and how people treat me and each other. Im sick and tired of the hate we all do to each other. We are all in pain for different reasons in life. I feel like its pain for seeing how the world is and wishing that these conversations would start to get visibly better. I scroll Reddit because of how amazingfunnybeautiful things can be. I think Im too weighed down from seeing so much pain. I got divorced a year ago and all of my friends and I lost touch. My ex was a good person most of the time but he did some pretty abusive stuff too. And so Im dealing with grief of people no longer being in my life that I liked having around but that I had to say goodbye to in a way so that my life could try to get better. I want the grief to heal. I want my self worth to heal back. Im tired emotionally and I know Ill get back on my feet. Theres so many reasons to feel sad about anything or everything. But what do you do next once you know that? Knowing theres endless reasons for things to be bad or to be good. I feel drained like its some sort of mental gravity not sure how to describe it but almost like Ive been working myself too hard. Things will get better but I need to figure out how to heal myself inside.",

    "What can be done to help my friend? Im friends with a Finnish woman. We dont live in the same country. According to her, her depression stems from being bullied back in school and being unhappy about her weight. She hates herself intensely and has a hard time trusting anyone. Sometimes I encourage her to do things that could improve her life, like working out or looking for a job, but she tells me that it is impossible to feel motivated to do it due to depression. Shes also made many attempts to kill herself. Every few weeks, she gets into a suicidal state again. And the part that makes it the hardest to help her is that, she has tried therapy many times and it didnt work. Then I suggested looking for treatment in neighboring countries, but she says its pointless because it is the same everywhere. I dont know what else I can encourage her to do. Im out of ideas.",
    "Low functioning depression Hi reddit. The title of this post is quite ironical as Ive spent the last 10 minutes making a new account just so I could post this anonymously, have had to get out of bed for it and have finally dedicated myself to doing at least something today. Nonetheless, I see this situation as a minor bright spot in my current life and desperately need advice regardless. I am a senior highschooler from a lowincome family in Europe. Ever since I was 13 or 14 years old Ive been struggling with some kind of selfdiagnosed I never went to therapy for many reasons depression andor anxiety. The causes of such problems have changed throughout the years, but they were mostly linked with social anxiety, unhealthy amount of selfimposed academic stress and god knows what else. My first two years of high school were marked by drenching amounts of anxiety regarding new acquaintances, extremely low self esteem, low functioning due to stress and frequent suicidal thoughts and wishes. Over time, my social anxiety went away, with it most of my problems, and for the last year I havent felt as close as bad as I did before. I thought my depression finally disappeared, and that Ive changed as a person. Now, I know I was wrong. At the moment I am experiencing a great deal of stress caused by university planning. Like previously mentioned, I live in a lowdeveloped European country in a lowmiddle class family. My biggest chance to do something with my life is to go to university abroad, as universities in my country are pretty much shit. Ive dedicated all of my elementary and high school education to university planning, constantly striving for good grades, many extracurriculars and additional tests. And now, when the time has finally come to apply for universities and write my damn personal essays and send them, I blocked. I cannot make myself to sit and write the essays, as I am a huge perfectionist and am probably scared to start writing as I fear they wont end up good. The more time passes, the more stressed I am, the harder it is to focus, and it all ends up being a great, vicious circle.",

I know I should qualify for financial help, but I have no idea how to go about it or which programs to pursue. Im scraping by, deep in student loan amp hospital debt that I cant afford to pay because I can barely make rent, trying to save up for a supercheap, used, under 1,000 car so I can get a better job I currently work retail part time and take painting amp illustration commissions part time, but Im exhausted even working the few hours that I do thanks, brain. Ive been struggling with depression amp anxiety since my freshman year of college 2015, culminating in a suicide attempt amp an involuntary stay in a mental hospital a little over two years ago. I cant afford counseling, and I cant get medication without a car. Its been a while since Ive been on meds. Not sure I would be able to afford it if I could reach it. I was raised in a cultlike Christian conservative homeschooling home, so until college I was very isolated from modern culture, common sense, and a normal view of the world.

    "I’m starting to have a harder time functioning Hey, Im a 19 yo male 20 on Easter. Thought that would be a fun thing to throw in and Ive been living with depression since I was 9 or 10. Its just progressed as Ive gone on. Ive always been an extremely self loathing person and the negative thoughts just come up more frequently. It just happens out of nowhere. Doesnt matter what Im doing, itll just sucker punch me. My mood gets really dark at the snap of a finger. But now its getting harder to actually cope with it and function as a human being. I think its been this way for about a year now. I used to be able to escape it if I was doing something active. Like with friends or whatever. But now it doesnt matter. Itll just fuck me up whenever. Sometimes it can get to the point where Ill have difficulty remembering things or having a conversation, I dont know how to formulate sentences, and it just becomes allconsuming. I dont understand it. My thoughts in this state range from craving substances to escape, thoughts about how nobody likes me and I dont matter to anyone, and sometimes thoughts that I need to hang myself. I want to have a good life but I dont want to live it as me. Im way too hard on myself. I know I have a charismatic personality that some people enjoy, and I can acknowledge some of my strengths when Im more level headed, but more and more I just regress to what I described earlier where my mind just tries to take me down.",

    "I'm 16 and I'm a mess sorry in advance for bad grammar I dont remember when it started. It was weird, realizing how much I stopped enjoying most things. My favorite video games werent as exciting anymore. I wasnt as interested in anime and Manga anymore, I didnt feel like consuming it either. My days became boring, each one beginning with the envy of enjoying something that I used to love and each of them ending with this overwhelming feeling of regret. I was more angry, I ranted with myself a lot about stupid things, I was crying more, most of the time because of stupid things albeit that started a chain of thoughts leading to more serious issues and regrets. And mostly, I was so tired man, and it just gets worse and worse. Its to a point where it feels crippling, like I cant do anything anymore that requires a minimum of effort. I dont understand. Lots of times, I wasnt even sure if I really had something. Maybe Im just too lazy? Maybe Im just tired? Is it really depression? But why? Why would I have these thoughts, when others are having a it so much worse than me? I dont understand. I feel so overwhelmed by myself. Sometimes I want to confess to someone, to tell them everything I have on my mind, but now I just feel like there is so much that I dont even know where to begin. Nowadays, I cant even make the effort of talking to my friends. Im scared that Ill lose them. Im scared Im not being a good enough friend, Im scared Im isolating from them and they will just go, Im scared that Im not enjoy their presence enough and I know I will regret just lie everything else. I know I can make them laugh and smile but I feel like I cant even do that properly anymore, like Im slowly losing this ability, I feel like Im not as interesting as I used to be, or as I could be, I feel like Im not as funny, and I feel so much more things that I cant even begin to list.

Ive been in therapy and different treatments for so long, and it just always comes back to me wanting to stop existing. There have been days where I think it could get better, but that stops pretty quickly. Ever since middle school Ive been thinking about ending it. Its only until recently that Ive made a true plan and stuff. I feel like a complete asshole because I have a great life, my parents love me, yada yada, and yet I still feel this way. Im still so tired and lonely and I feel like a complete fuckup. Honestly, its not even that I want to commit suicide, I just dont want to exist anymore.

    "I’m tired of pushing forward. Hello all. This is my first time trying to reach out for help and doing so with friends and family feels shameful because I am my familys rock and support system. Its never been the other way around and the few times I asked for some help from my wife its always ended badly. I am 27 Male with a wife who is 28 and a son who is 3. When I met my wife I was already depressed, though never clinically diagnosed. All the signs were there though. Always tired, no motivation, indulging in vices just to feel something. I had no purpose and in all honesty I never ended it because it would be more trouble than it was worth. My mother and sister would be hurt and financially strained from my sudden death so I just lived day in and day out trying to not to sink too low. They were my excuse to live. After meeting my wife things because brighter. My family definitely noticed an improvement in my attitude and I started taking care of my self more. For a while we only hung out, nothing official yet so I wanted to put my best self forward in hopes of building a relationship with this amazing woman. A year later we married and she got pregnant. It was my sons birth that pushed me to go back to school and get a better job. Simply put my finances would not be able to sustain a decent life style. Ive noticed though that slowly over the years Ive started to fall back into the same depressed state of mind. I am unbelievably tired all the time, I have started buying more alcohol than normal and spending more and more time playing online games in hopes of getting some moments or happiness in a day of glum. My wife has noticed and started complaining that Im changing for the worse. I can see it but I just cant seem to do anything about it. I have moments of motivation where I will be good for a couple days but then revert back. Recently I had a bad episode where I just started drinking and wallowing in self pity. My son was already asleep so he wasnt exposed to it. When my wife came home she seemed concerned but didnt really know how to react.",
    "How to deal with the cyclical triad of draining symptoms Over the past months my depression has progressively become more disruptive. Im now to the point where Im stuck in a cycle of anxiety during the day, insomnia at night, and anhedonia all throughout the day. Its definitely affected my work as I know and feel Im not as efficient and poignant as I used to be, and I fear that Ill lose my job due to lackluster work. Outside of increasing my SSRI dose with my doc, how can I overcome this if I cant find therapy right now due to pandemic? Much of my depression I feel comes from loneliness. Im a man in my late 20s and Ive never had a true best friend or romantic partner. I hoped this year would be that year because I found a job in a city I wanted to live, and it felt like a chance at renewed life. I accepted before the shutdown, and started after restrictions were in place, so Ive spent the entire year alone in a new city as all social avenues were cut off. I almost have no socialization with coworkers either due to working remotely. I tried online dating, but that made things worse as I didnt match with anyone and sent me on a selfdoubting downward spiral.

I have no idea what I want to do with my life. I feel lost. And thats only half of my issue. I just want to be hugged, I want someone to cuddle and talk with, but nobodys there. I want to feel like I matter to someone other than my family, I want to share my life with someone. But I cant do that. Not at this age. Im just so mad about it, I feel like crying and giving up on all of it, but I know that would only make it worse. Im just tired of the waiting. I wish time would move faster.

Other things like academic aspects, going deeper into a topic, studying neuro science or pharmacology esp. neuroscience was a love of mine, I spent a lot of time with it and it was the reason for me starting the bachelor in psychology is almost impossible for me because depression makes me dumb, disabled and very restricted in thinking or making. Im sorry for the long text. Thanks to everyone who read until here. What are your thoughts? Do you have experience with this and somehow managed to improve the situation and feelings? Do you have ideas for projects or hobbies I could try to get into and maybe find a passion in to kill my feelings of emptiness, negative thoughts and self worth issues? I would be happy about any idea, anything, thats somehow manageable even when being depressed and socially anxious. Something I can hold onto, improve in and get feelings of success and self worth or skill. Something that distracts me from negative thoughts and psychological pain of depression. Have a nice day, I wish you the best! lt3",
    "My mother and I had an unsettling conversation in the midst of my depression, and I don't know how to feel... My mother quickly took me out of that daycare and felt so bad for leaving me there. Ive always remembered preschool, but Ive never known what actually happened in that building. After that event, the teens were arrested, and since today, that building had been shut down for 11 years. The next one, the first one I recall, was when I was in elementary school. I was in kindergarten, and the teachers were very strict, and they had the worst principal I had ever seen. He had beaten, tortured, and yelled at many kids, including me. I was once beaten, dragged to the office, and tied to a chair for the rest of the day in my kindergarten year. My mother was pissed off as the school when she saw my bruise marks. When I heard this happened to me, I remembered and regained my perspective on that moment, and two others I now recall. Another time I remember that was mentioned to me was in that same school in about first or second grade. This one kid would bully me over and over, and he would beat on me if he ever caught up to me, and the teachers just let him. One day, I thought I had put up with this crap far too much and was beating that kids ass. It took four teachers to pull me off him. They told my mother to immediately come to the school for my actions, and she took me out for ice cream for standing up for myself, and we were pissed off about how the teachers just let bad things happen to kids at that elementary school. The last memory I remember was in that same year in that same elementary school. One time, I feel off the top of the slide in the playground and busted my head open on the pavement. I was bleeding everywhere, and I now remember how bad it felt. The teachers were just again, standing there. Not even helping, not even calling for emergency services. Just watching. They didnt even call my mother.",

    "Placing too much on outside help? Hello, I 20m am a Junior in college. I have dealt with social anxiety, self esteem issues, and most recently depression for nearly half my life. It was a result of reactionary behavior I caused my own problems and I have never been able to shake it, as I tell myself I am incapable of change. Cause yourself problems once, you will sure as hell cause them again I have been spiraling more or less over the last few years, and only now am I sane enough to look at my lifelong issues. Unfortunately, I recently moved to a new city where I know no one. The loneliness has recently gotten to my head, and that combined with the stressfulness of college has me incredibly overwhelmed. Suicide has been on my mind more and more lately until I told myself today I would do it. But here I am. I have an appointment with a therapy clinic lined up on 59 May 9th  USA, but I do feel guilty to an extent. All that goes through my head upon dealing with my problems is tell the therapist and they will assist you in making sense of it. This has me feel irresponsible and ridiculous. There has been many people in life who cant afford help and have gotten along just fine. Its your life, and at the end of the day its on you to fix it. Yet at the same time I am so lost. All that goes through my head is my inner critic, saying its pointless. Sorry to ramble. My point being, those who have had success beating their issues on their own, what techniquesroutinesactivities did you use  partake in? What helped change your perspectives? Any feedback is appreciated thanks for reading if for some reason you got this far",
    "Dating someone with depression - help Hi, This is a throwaway account. I need some help andor advice. About a half a year ago I 32F started dating someone M42 absolutely amazing. We share interest, same humor, honesty have been there since the beginning, we can talk about anything, even shared deeply vulnerable stories and the sex is amazing as well. We seem to be able to connect in a way Ive never tried before and create this space where it is just us. Green flags all the way. I quickly fell madly in love with him ofcourse. I shared my feelings for him about 4 months into it, told him no pressure at all since I wasnt ready for a full blown serious relationship and he didnt either. I have no doubt that he has feelings for me. Non. About 2 months ago he fell deep down into depression. He told me. I told him if there was anything I could do to help? He said maybe. I told him I was there if he needed to talk. He said thank you. Asked him if he wanted to meet up again soon? He said he was feeling so bad and was overwhelmed at work he works a lot. I said no problem, you just write me when the time is better, no pressure and Im not mad. Take your time. He said he would. Its been a month since that last text, and I havent heard anything. My guts tell me to just wait, but I am worried and a little unsure of how to handle this situation.. Should I keep on waiting I am not in a hurry and if Im not going to continue my relationship with him I dont feel like dating at all right now or should I reach out? afraid of preassuring. Abandoning him is not an option. Please give me some advice or share if you have a similare story. I would love to hear from someone who has depression and who is dating someone who hasnt.",
    "I want to be happy Ive bern depressed for almost a decade now. I feel like my life is going nowhere, I always feel like shit, my mind is filled with negative thoughts all the time. I feel like naturally im a happy go lucky, hard working, fun, logical woman. Ive been like that before, and people tell me I am. But my depression makes me feel lazy, unmotivated, grouchy etc. I see a therapist, it helped at first now it doesnt. I refuse to go on medication for a lot of reasons... so how else do I become better???

    "How do I tell my parents I’m depressed For context, Im 19 years old and Im starting my second year at a community college in August. I want to take a semester off due to an all time low in motivation. Id rather not wasted my parents money and instead spend that time getting a job, seeing a therapist, working out, really just getting better. The problem with telling them I dont want to go this semester is I have to have a good reason and Id rather not lie to them. They know about my anxiety which is hard enough for me to deal with sometimes but them knowing I have depression is a whole other thing. And I know its not as bad as my brain is telling me it is but I cant help it. I was hoping to get some advice on the matter because if I dont make up my mind soon Ill lose the opportunity to enroll in class if things dont go play out how I think they might.",

    "I ( 26 female ) have decided to take care of my severely depressed younger brother (20m ) by letting him move in with me last week and need some tips. How do I keep him motivated to stay on track and improve slowly slowly day by day ? I guess in conclusion my biggest fear is that taking care of him gets me sick too  I think its a valid fear considering I am mentally fragile ans afraid of ending up depressed too  DISCLAIMER I dont want comments telling me he should be helped by someone else. He had nobody else and it is my pleasure to help him and be there for him forever. I just have legitimate concerns that I believe your tips and advice could help me navigate the situation better. Any tips ? ? Thank you so much, Christina. TLDR come from an abusive home, made it out, somewhat okay trying to get my life back on track ans have been on track for a while so to speak but need advice helping me brother after he moved out of our abusive home, he has severe depression and psychomotor retardation and lack of appetite.

    "How to stop feeling like I missed out? or something? I feel stupid but I just got a wave of depression watching a try not to sing video from the try not to channel, and High School Musical came on. Some backstory, I grew up in a dysfunctional family my brother was stillborn and my parents became so depressed.. we were loved but we never had routine or did any chores so our house was always VERY messy growing up, and gross and in 2008 we u.s. housing crisis hit us hard. I grew up pretty poor, always housed but it was a messy house and we were not great in ways of food or new clothes or entertainment. Thats where hhighschool musical comes in. I did not have cable TV or a DVD player, just a vhs and a couple tapes. Everything something like video gaming nights with the boys memes or this instance of people trying not to sing a song I dont know, I feel like I missed out on so much that everyone else got to experience because they had more money. Or, parents that were better at organizing their money. I dont know how to let go of these feelings for such fuckin mundane shit like not everyone had an Xbox growing up, MOST people didnt, but it feels like everyone around me did. Im just sad idk. I dont want to be sad. The house is still messy and I still feel like Im missing things and cant get them back.",
    "Starting a new job with depression Im seeking some advice. I recently started a new job. Im suffering severe depression at the moment which has worsened after a breakup bit of background, Ive suffered from depression on and off for the last 10 years. Unmediated right now  thinking of going back back but afraid of going back to my old cycles. Ive been in some very dark places recently and have regular ideation. Im okay right now  Im lucid and not distressed or apathetic to the point of wanting to end things. As mentioned, I recently started a new job. A promotion in my current company. My HR team is aware of my history and medical record. But Im finding it hard at the moment to settle into my new role. Im swinging between showing enthusiasm and working to prove myself to complete apathy and disinterest in any kind of future it might bring me. Its making things really hard for me. Its like a part of me doesnt care at all, even though the doors are opening for me to do the things Ive wanted to do for such a long time. I cant seem to find any kind of joy. I feel grateful to my new boss for the opportunity and I know Im just onboarding so its still early but theres a part of me that doesnt care if I crash and burn. Its like Im waiting for it.

    "When I encounter problems, even not so big, my mind automatically goes to “I just want to die. Would all the pain and stress go away if i just die?” Has anyone else felt like this? Even little things seems to trigger my desire to just die. The stress of buying a home is triggering these thoughts. I feel stupid for wanting to die every time bad things or inconveniences happen to me. Whats wrong with me? If i just shoot myself w a gun or die of a horrible car accident, all my problem and stress would just go away. I wouldnt have to worry about being all these problems in my life. The only thing stopping me are my kids and husband. Whos gunna take care of them? My kids cant grow up without a mom. But idk how much longer I can continue. Ive tried getting professional help...it doesnt work. Nothing will make these thoughts go away. Ive been depressed my whole life. I just want to give up already. im tired.",
    "Been feeling extra lost lately. I wonder if its just the negative vibes in the air surrounding all this Covid business and other negative news like peoples mental health declining, more suicides or destruction due to climate change. Im starting to feel that my whole lifes been dictated for me from the beginning. I never had much control. Now that Im a certain age, im expected to function normally but somehow I cant find anything to motivate me. I cant find anything that interests me and drives me to do better. The feeling sucks. Its almost like this is how older people driven to suicide must feel. A burden on people they know, aimless. Nothing left to live for. Feels like no one will notice if Im gone. Ive never done anything worthwhile or contributed to anything anyway.",

I just wanna die. I want to feel loved Im just tired of existing.",
    "What happens when you get better? This might sound like a ridiculous question, but Ive started to think about what things would be like if I was better. Ive started some new meds and have no idea if they will work but I dont remember what it was like to not be in dark place mentally. What if I dont know know who I am without depression? I havent had an extended period of a good spell for 15 years, this started when I was about 12 so I just dont know what things would be like if the meds did actually help. Is this a silly thing to be anxious over? Anyone have any advice or been through this too?",
    "please help, I’m constantly angry and aggressive So during the day I can mask how bad I actually feel but in the evening I lose my temper more and more. I am quarantined with my mom usually I live with my dad and stepdad and I hate it here. I dont feel at home, its constant discomfort and anxiety. In the evenings I get mad at everything, dinner is something I dont like, I discuss something it can be whatever but I just get so aggressive and mad at my mom. I just dont know what to do it drives me insane! I feel like shit but that doesnt mean everybody else has to feel like shit too. What can I do? Has anyone dealt with this before?",

Ive been feeling terrible lately, my mind races all the time, so I distract myself with games. Ive had a loss of appetite for the past couple of months. I generally dont feel like doing anything, as in no energy or motivation. Ive been this way for a while but I didnt want to self diagnose but I am going to talk to someone at the end of the month. If I am depressed, is there any advice you can give to help me not succumb to my thoughts? I dont want to die but I do think about it sometimes.",
    "Why can't depression ever be gone forever? I got mad. And i couldnt get angry at anyone. I felt like even when i did my best to avoid something it happened again. And i burst crying pretty dramatically.. i felt devastated. I mean i know its a ridiculous way to react but i went from good day to worst day ever for a stupud reason in no time and i couldnt stop laughing for a while. I guess i felt frustrated or idk but i kept muttering stuff and couldnt stop crying. And when i calmed down about half an hour later i was worried i had reacted this way before when i wasnt feeling well but i didnt think id react that way now. I thought everything was fine. Now i just dont know if i really am. The only reason i can think of as the source is that Ill be taking classes again after almost a year now Ive failed my last high school year twice in the past when my depression was really bad and after that and therapy i felt good enough to study again i stopped highschool i chose a different institute i studied for two years and my grades were good for the two years ive been studyingi passed the final exam but half way through the end year project i just gave up. I dont know if i can blame my mental health for it or if i just turned into a self sabotaging person or just that it wasnt what i really wanted to do bur i was driven by the fact that i dont have a choice so i just did it. After that i stayed out of school for about a year doing half time jobs and now i want to try something different again. Im afraid thats the cause but i dont want it to be i just wanna finish what i start this time. This thing is already going on for too long. Im not sure what Im asking you here. But i guess i want an opinion or advice. Im worried i cant tell when Im not ok until symptoms get physical and how am i supposed to deal with that.. what if it affects how i deal with stuff negatively and Ill only be aware of it when its too late. Anyway.. thanks for reading until the end i appreciate it.",
    "Just really super depressed right now, obviously... This is my first post here so I dont know whats required or normal. Im just really feeling awful. Dont sleep or sleep way too much. Either dont eat at all or eat way too much. Constantly stuck in why bother mode for literally everything. Dont want ot get out of bed ever, it only when Im forced for work or to go to the bathroom etc. I dont have a whole lot of a support system. Maybe a small amount of family left and an more small amount of kind of friends. And yes am in therapy but it doesnt seem to help. Seriously, soo sorry for the whole life story but again dont know this works exactly. I promise i wont be so long winded again..",
    "After medication, what’s next? Ive had biological depression since I was fifteen and lately theres very little I can do to keep myself motivated and avoid negative thoughts the REALLY negative kind.

    "My brains are fried... Sometimes I cant help but laugh bitterly at the fact that I used to be the smartest in my class and now I struggle to focus and remember for even half an hour. I read things over and over and it hardly sticks. I feel like an idiot really. Even things that interest me are hard. Part of me wants to just give up, cause the thing I am studying isnt even that useful, its more to help myself. Is there any way I can improve my brain?",
    "I'm nothing without my medication. Hey, im Bradley. Im turning 16 close to the end of this year. This years exams that are upcoming are really, really important and will determine my near future. Its stressful, but I always avoid getting stressed. Heres where the first problem comes in when im not stressed, I dont worry about the exams. So in the end, theres completely no effort when the day comes. Medication started about a month or two ago. So far, ive missed some days and yes, my psychiatrist knows. I wont elaborate on my problems but basically I have been diagnosed with depression after close to 3 years of suffering in silence. And it has been tough. Seeking help didnt relieve me that much, but it did. My mood changed a little, im kind of more positive in terms of my everyday life. Just school, sports and home. A cycle. Everytime theres signs which are triggers, but im afraid of telling my teachers or psychiatrist because im just too scared to im always getting into that depressive episode. I get easily angry, especially to my friends and I tend to be impulsive during these anger moments. Its tough dealing with depression. Really tough. Medication just makes it seem like I cant handle things on my own, and drugs are needed just for my mood to get better I mean, when I was a child it was so easy to be happy, why not now?. I seem to never forget that without medication id be dead. I dont know if I should see it that way or whether I should take things on my own. Its masculinity, right? If we could handle this, were stronger than others, right? People always tell us that itd be better if they understood what I was going through, but must I really tell _everyone_ that I have depression?",
    "Feeling at the end of the line I didnt confront the issue till I was 24 and a girlfriend that I used to talk to and sort of wanted something more were talking about our feelings and I just plained told her what had happened to me and she told me that something similar happened to her at a similar age, we cried and talked about it and other things, strangely even as we felt closer after this we went our separate ways being just good friends to this day she is married, lives in a different country and has a baby, after that I worked through my trauma alone with little success side note, there is a history of violent tendencies in the men of my family, both from my mothers and fathers side, and Im basically the mixed result. A couple years later I met my first long relationship girlfriend and as you can imagine I fell hard for her and spoiled her like crazy, she helped my reconnect with my father and I told her about my trauma and to my surprise she also was a victim, we both tried to get professional help within our means but only I got serious about it and kept going to my sessions, she said she was fine on her own and knowing how hard this was I let her take her own choice and just tried to be supportive when needed, needless to say it ended bad, near the end when we were about to move in together I tried to start a conversation about how we began getting together and how special she was to me, apparently I was the only one that felt that way because she told me that the only reason she kissed me and begun hanging out with me was because she felt pity for me, we had other issues like a poor sexual life and not enough time on her part for us, so after she told me about how we really had begun our relationship I felt numbed and after a few days in emotional hell I broke up with her, I listed all that was wrong with the relationship and told her that something that begins with pity cant have a future, I wasnt able to tell her that that was what hurt me the must, she never apologized and we went our separate ways, her family loved me and knew I was the good guy and I was the best for her and tried to help but never went passed of a small conversation with me, they were harder on her but in the end they are her family, I found out she also cheated later on and it was what killed the last pieces of love I had for her, I didnt confront her about it and we never spoke ever again, the pity confession destroyed my self confidence we were together for close to 4 years.",
    "How can I support the man I'm dating who is depressed? The guy Im dating has been having a tough week due to two things happening and I think it has triggered his depression hes told me about his mental illnesses before. Our relationship has been amazing so far but this week he has been really quiet with me and doesnt want to talk, and now it has come to leaving my messages on read. Im really concerned about him because I dont want him to feel he has to suffer alone, but I also understand that everyone copes with things differently, and perhaps he just needs to get his thoughts in order before talking to me again. Ive sent messages telling him Ill always be there for him and nothing will push me away, and I know how rough it can be because some of my family members also suffer from depression. Ive also told him I will give him space to think and get his mind in order and that he can message me anytime he feels like talking, but I do want to keep checking in on him over the next few days to show Im there for him. If anyone else has any advice on how I can support him, then it would be greatly appreciated, thank you.",

I will be expected to be there and be happy when the time comes. I am expected to take a lot of pictures because it is so cute and he only turns one once. Instead, I will be dying inside, waiting for the time when everyone leaves and I can go back to my safe place. Away from people so I dont bring them down. Ive thought about doing suicide by cop a few times. But even then I think about how that would make them feel. I wouldnt want to do that to someone else. I wouldnt want to risk my actions causing someone else to possibly go down the road I am on now. So instead, I suffer. Always someone around but always feeling alone. How do I make it all go away?",

    "My best friend's depression is triggering mine. What do I do? Ive been depressed for years and hated all the thoughts of suicide that were stuck in my head. A month ago I finally opened up to my parents, things have brightened up, I seeked professional help last week, and might have some counseling with my fam soon. Ive reconnected with people Ive missed, and Im really trying my hardest to stop feeling depressed. Ive even started reading up on meditation and such. My doc and I are still thinking about the meds though. But my bestfriend...is suicidal and depressed, Ill call them John for now. He regularly has the urge to selfharm, skip meals, or do reckless things. And regularly talks about wanting to die and how he wants to do it. Ive given him a lot of advice and Ive done my best to remind him that Im always here. But....its starting to feel like he never takes any advice I give and that hes given up on himself already. He already seeked help long before I ever did but he hates his meds cuz he thinks it just forces him to be happy. Hes an online friend so I cant approach him face to face. Ive known him for so long and I know thats hes a good person and that he doesnt deserve this. He wants a better life where hes free from his family...so I recommended some small job offerings to keep him stable but he doesnt want to commit to it. I recommended he find some hobbies...but he doesnt want to. I told him to try making new friends, he says he already has me... I tried to explain why that wouldnt be healthy and he seemed to try to say that other people will just hurt him...but Im not perfect... I cant provide for all of his emotional needs... I barely have control of my own. I cant help but feel the need to play strong just so he has someone to lean on. I want to finally start thinking about myself and relax...but everytime I do I feel like Im leaving him behind.",

On Monday I have to go again into school and I just dont want anymore I cant complete an normal day every time I am angry and sad about myself I dont want to do anything and going to an place with toxic people and utterly boring tasks to do combined with anxiety about almost everything seems it so utterly unbearable to make I just want to stay in my room even if its till the sommer where I get my school graduation I cant take it anymore!! !",
    "I feel like my subconscious is trying to keep me depressed Lately Ive been struggling with my mental health. Its gotten to the point that I feel physically sick from it, and Im fed up. Im a person who gets stuck on details and repeating the past in my head over and over to the point that I get sick. And then the next day Ill be extremely hyper and euphoric for about 4 hours and swing immediately back into this depressive state like its my default state. I feel like no one likes me and that I have no friends, and the reason that Im in a leadership position in theatre is because my director feels bad for me. Although people tell me that thats not true I cant engrain that into my head for some reason. Part of me knows that Im being irrational and overthinking everything, but I cant stop. It feels like Im subconsciously looking for something to upset me and get me down so I can keep feeding my depression, and I hate it. I want to get better, I really really do, yet my brain wont let me. I keep making things a way bigger deals in my head than they actually should be. I keep feeling like people are out to get me when theyre not. Its like I have tow people living in my head, the depressed one is in charge, and the rational one is being held captive and out of control. Its negatively impacting my relationships. Please, Im begging, if anyone knows how to stop this please tell me. Im so tired of everything getting spun out of control in my head.",
    "Please help, i am so tired Can someone please explain? So i dated this guy one year ago. He became severely depressed and we kept texting when he felt like it. He doesnt really talk to me about it because he doesnt want to burden me its annoying. He is seeing a therapist once a week and is taking all kinds of medication. I made him a christmas package. With gifts, food, and a selfmade depression journal see my other post. And i cant wait to cheer him up with it. I texted him last Thursday if i could bring it. He seemed happy about it and we agreed to meet that evening. But then he texts me last minute saying his best friend is at his place and he forgot they were going to have diner together. He then gave me all kinds of new options, and I then asked if today was okay, but i still didnt get a text back... it has been 3 days I dont know what to do anymore. Should i send him another text? Ugh I am trying to support him but he keeps letting me down every time. He is with his best friend literally every second of the day, it seems like he cant be alone. But he also seems to be unable to text me back? I dont understand. I really dont. I read books, i talked to you guys, and i educated myself about depression, but i am so tired. Can somebody please try to explain? I dont even know what i should do with the christmas box anymore... advice is really appreciated"
