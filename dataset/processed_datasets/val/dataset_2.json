    "I fucking hate bipolar In mania got violent with a parent. was taken to juvy. Was released because the petition wasnt filed. In my state they cant hold you for 24 hours with no petition. Was released still riding the high wave of high energy excited to go home. Was taken to my empty grandparents house. Then to my uncles. Met with a new therapist, very emotional getting out of mania finally and spiralling down into depression. I feel like dont have a future with my family, Im better off dead so dont cause anymore legal trouble. I dont deserve to be alive. My public defender said I cant say anything about the event, I cant apologize to said parent. My parents think lm a danger to them, when know just want to sulk in my own sorrow in a safe space.",
    "How can I (28f) help my Mum (56f) who is depressed and considering suicide. My Mum has struggled with severe depression ever since her early teens. She has been on a variety of antidepressants on and off for many years and has attempted suicide to the best of my knowledge twice before. She has never kept up with therapy of any sort as she doesnt believe it works. Previously when she fell into a depressive state she would become incredibly pessimistic and irritable, withdrawn, sleep long hours  really just your average symptoms of depression. In recent times over the last 6 months her behaviour has escalated to the point where I am deeply concerned that she will attempt suicide again She doesnt socialise. She has always had a small social group but is now not even engaging in the two things she had been keeping up with for years daily gym and a monthly book club and refuses to do anything new due to the cost. She hates her job and her coworkers, but will not look for other employment because she considers herself too old to get employment elsewhere. Her hatred of her workplace has escalated to the point where she will literally just leave, without advising anyone, and go home to bed. She justifies this as they wouldnt notice me if i was there anyway. Previously she has always had an incredibly strong work ethic, she wouldnt miss a day ever! She is unwilling to stay on antidepressants for extended periods. She doesnt like that they make her gain weight 5kgs OR shes feels that they have done their job and stops taking them cold turkey. This particular behaviour has been an ongoing problem for as long as I can remember but now she wont even consider making an appointment to get a script. She is sending nasty texts and emails to her siblings and cousins, accusing them of imagined petty insults towards her and reacting disproportionately when they tell her that she is acting inappropriately and needs to seek help, she believes they are just trying to get rid of her. Previously they had a friendly but distant relationship without regular contact.",
    "Morning disgust Hello there. Been diagnosed with severe depression two years ago. Now i got rid of medications, and there has been no problem for month or two. School started and I noticed how often i would get sick due to weather change. I also started to be more nervous in open spaces, even at home. But the worst thing that came back are the mornings... each day, in early hours, I would wake up, with sudden... disgust? I dont know how to explain it... basically the thought of getting up is terrifying. It feels like torture. Whenever i would think of something positive, my brain would deny it, or even worse, make my positive thoughts negative. Telling me i am all alone, that this is forever, and that I am a bad person for not doing anything about it. I know i am very sensitive person, But i havenť seen anyone so terrified by this. People would judge me and tell me that its my duty to go to school. They would start explaining it to me like I am some stupid outcast who thinks he can do whatever he wants. I know that i canť, but this issue is stopping me from doing so. Now that its back... I am terrified more than ever. It is easier to overcome it by getting up with no thought, but it is still hard and life consuming. I dont know what to do, have you ever experienced something like this?",
    "Unbearable sadness - literally feel like I can not go on if I feel like this This is a bit rambly and melodramatic but need to feel like someone can hear me out. The older I get the more intensely sad I feel. Its like there are always further levels. Lately I have been feeling less numb and more an intense wave after wave of sadness. Today my neighbour played Video Games by Lana Del Rey and it just started me thinking of loss. Losing people. If I believe that deathbreaking up means goodbye forever, it becomes unbearable to go on. I had a fight with my first boyfriend. Im wondering if I could cope with a break up. I think breakups are harder than losing someone cause they died. Especially if that person was a good person and things just didnt work out. Cause then you keep living with the whatifs. Im 23 and life has yet to start properly kicking me in the ass. Im the youngest in my family, everyone is getting old.",
    "I got into rpg commu to escape reality but It made my depression got worse. Im 22 years old who currently struggling with film thesis in my senior year. My thesiss topic is hard and its stressing me out. And I found this community where you draw a character and roleplaying with others character in some sort of setting like MMORPG. So I decided to use it to escape from some stress from my works. But it turned worsen. I have no friends there and its like everyone is knowing each other. I know the fact that I didnt active much because of my works and Im kind of confident in my drawing and painting skill Im parttime freelance artist. But nobody played with me or make their character talk to mine. I got anxious so I tried to please everyone by praising their characters in introduction posts or asking for our interactions of our own chars. Some didnt reply my message. In the last 5 days, I got sleepy entire day, lost an appetite, I only ate a small meal or snack once in a day and insomnia. I felt left out. So I brought my account to follow their public account with feeling that If I befriend with them maybe theyll be interact with me ? Some of them turned out fine. But theres one who seemed to hate me because stupid me had bad choice of words when complimented their char. At first, they didnt know Im the owner of that char, they seemed happy enough but once they knew the truth, they seemed off and didnt talk to me since. I know its stupid to give a damn about mimicking world where those members came from wherever in the world. But its so stressing when you feel like talking to a brick and everyone treats you like an air. Please say something, I really need support",

    "Help finding therapist Hi everyone. First time posting here and looking to see if anyone has any advice. This is not a throw away because I dont care what people think about me. I suffer from highly functional depression. I have been seeing a psychiatrist and am currently on medication, which helps, but still have bad days. I have seen a psychologist in the past, middle aged male, that I couldnt open up to. After seeing him for 2 years I stopped going because of work change. My spouse, primary care, and psychiatrist all urge me to find someone to talk to. I thought long and hard and realized the personality of someone that I could open up to. With all this being said, is there a good way to search for local therapists online in your area? I tried a few months back and could only find older individuals. I need someone closer to my age 36 as I feel it would allow me to open up more. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.",
    "My mental health is getting really bad guys Ive lost count how many times Ive posted this. My mental health is crippling me. I cant get over the fact Im a 22 year old virgin and no girls remotely enjoy me or my company. My depression and anxiety has reached such a point that I dont even wanna hang out with my friends because their success with women just makes me feel so bad about myself. Recently, this girl who I was gonna ask out just subtly told me she wasnt interested. Im so jealous and envious of my friends with women. I just need advice.",
    "I'm getting angry at my depression. I want to break out of it and I can't seem to shake it. I wasnt able to complete homework because of mental fog and everytime I opened my online class dashboard I would break down and cry until I fell asleep. I did a few assignments and it would take me half the day to write a 2 page paper. Took me a week to write a 6 page paper. I used to be able to do them in a few hours. I feel like my mind is deteriorating. Conversation is more difficult. I can easily explain my feelings because its a trait of my personality, but casual talk and reading people has become impossible. Im getting anxious because talking to people I already know is starting to feel like talking to strangers. Ive been crying my eyes out over small insecurities I used to be over and accept. Im trying to figure out how to reorganize my life but its so hard. I know people who go out and party and drink night after night and still go to college and go to work and are doing great. They are happy and healthy and only have a small nagging guilt about not getting more done. I feel like I produce NOTHING of value to the world and its so difficult to just chip away at learning a song or doing a simple assignment or task at work. All I can listen to is super depressing music as well if I want to enjoy it. I feel like a emo highschooler. My whole life Ive struggled with motivation, my parents called me a lazy piece of shit everyday and its true. Everything takes so much mental effort for me and I can barely focus because my mind goes a million miles an hour with intense imagery and nonsensical logic. To slow it down and focus on the world around me, especially the physical world, is a manual effort. The depression just makes it all the worse. I just want to know if anyone might relate and how they may have improved their lives? Ive been feeling so isolated even though I surround myself with people lately, and there are less and less reasons I want to stay around.",
    "Morning depression and how to handle it. Hello everyone. This is my first post in this sub. I was wondering, does anyone have any methods or anything to make morning depression go away? I sleep and wake up at the same time every day so I dont think that theres any problem in that regard. I also do exercise and eat well but the symptoms dont let up. Ive seen that these can be symptoms of major depression but I dont know how could that be, since I feel pretty good the rest of the day. Maybe some days are worse than others but idk. It hurts a lot. Every morning Im scared of waking up since I know that anything will make me feel depressed. Oh you have online classes? How about thinking that you should drop out because you have zero motivation to do any schoolwork? Youre watching a reality show? How about thinking that you are worthless and that you will never find a girlfriend since youre stuck in your house all day? Its tiring to be feeling this way every morning, and what my therapist asks me is just at what time of the day do I get depressed so that he can find the cause. But the thing is, that cause can be literally anything.",
    "16M can’t afford therapy and parents won’t pay for it. Things are getting worse every day I feel like shit every day and I just want to get out of this place otherwise life doesnt seem worth living. But I cant, Im stuck in a rut. My mental health is trash in so many ways. A couple years ago I was forcefully taken with a therapist and I hated her, she was so condescending and mean. I have resorted to this sub and similar ones to many times and I know thats not the best thing to do. I have no friends and no family to trust, Im so lonely.",
    "Spiraling out of control I can confidently say this is the hardest my depression has hit me in the 10 years Ive been struggling. I find myself so angry, lashing out at people who love me and just destroying everyone in my path. I just wish I could have a second chance at this. I am super hard on myself and cannot seem to control the negative self talk. I beat myself up over everything, especially not being able to control my emotions. Ive seen so many mental health professionals that I just get tired of telling my story over and over again. Committing myself to therapy or standing psych appointments seems more exhausting than suffering alone. I dont know what advice Im exactly looking for, so please forgive me if this is all over the place. Im just desperate. Im thinking ending my life, but Im definitely too much of a coward to carry it out. Any input or kind words are welcomed. Thank you",
    "Having a problem with the everyday lately... So I in the slow process of leaving my husband of near twenty years... there have been times where he has laid his hands on me and times when hes been super mean and really put my ego to the test. And now as I finally am teaching myself to step away and see him as he is, he is being way overly sweet and this... this is the face of him that makes me panic and think... maybe hes changing... maybe it really is me who is crazy... lately Ive been fantasizing about a permanent end to it, and I know it is my depression leading me into that way but it is what it is...",
    "Having panic attacks, crying daily and having anxiety because I can’t breathe Cant breathe from one side of my nose 90 of the time  all day every day. Happened gradually over the years due to nose aging and shifting after a rhinoplasty when I was a lot younger. Feeling very alone and scared. Terrified of surgery and what could go wrong. And picking the right surgeon. But also cant breathe which has declined the quality of my life. Feel stuck in catch 22 hell. Revision surgery again is worst nightmare for HSP, highly anxious, depressionprone, peoplepleaser and controlfreak type of person. Almost did it twice but got really bad vibes from interaction with a surgeon right before surgery so backed out. Shaken up from that negative experience. Grateful for any support, advice and stories on anyone that found the courage to do a complex and scary surgery all on their own.",
    "Letting my boyfriend commit suicide. Please help. He thinks he may be in the autism spectrum. He thinks hes incompetent and useless. He thinks hes very ugly I think he has BDD because I have it myself. The biggest issue is probably his OCD. He has severe contamination OCD, and its what hes in disability for. He says OCD is hell. One big example  He lived in a flat with Artex ceilings most of his adult life moved now and he believes hes been exposed to a lot of asbestos. He wants to end his life before lung cancer sets in. He is scared of aging and his body and mind deteriorating, getting diseases or becoming disabled and reliant on others for care. He resents this is the way things are and wants to end his life before nature can take its course. He resents life. I sympathize with all of these things and relate to many. The NHS has failed him. There seems to be no good help within his options. Hes so pessimistic about healthcare workers now that he doesnt want to try. He plans on committing suicide before summer because he thinks this flat is going to get unbearably hot. Its on the 3rdtop floor. His OCD wont allow him to use a fan because hes scared of fibers flying around, and no coolers involving water because hes worried about mold. He doesnt think a portable ac unit will be able to cool the flat down enough and that it will be very expensive. I cant personally think of another solution for the heat. I want him to know happiness, but it doesnt seem possible. I feel awful that hes stuck around for my sake. Hes missed out on sourcing the best drug for suicide now that UK customs are more strict since early January. He doesnt blame me, but it is my fault, and I really wont ever be able to forgive myself for it. Really, I do think he resents me. I dont know how to cope or how to go on myself. I need help, and I dont have anywhere to get it. Nothing makes any of this okay or better.",
    "I feel like my efforts are pointless I started going on daily walks like about a month ago because everyone kept telling me how its some kind of magic solution to my depression. I tried being consistent with going outside a lot of times before but I always found myself stopping after maybe 3 or 4 days. But this time I managed to keep it up for a month and I definitely like its an accomplishment, at least. At first it was hard to get used to but after a week I felt somewhat okay with it and no longer felt like I was forcing myself to do it. But now I just cant help but wonder why Im doing any of it. It doesnt really make me feel any better. Im still the depressed old me. And its not like I lost some weight either. Maybe Im expecting too much within a short time but honestly I still doubt it will do much even in the long run.",
    "Im not sure If Im depressed or if i’m just sad. Pls help Im writing this while sitting on my floor next to my bed in front of my vent because its the place I feel calmest right now. Ive been trying to figure out for a really long time if im actually depressed or if its just because its so popularized now and that its just how everyone feels. I dont have prolonged sadness and I dont feel it every second but some days are terrible. Both my mother and sister have depression and have had it all their lives. I used to go to counseling for anxiety in like 5th and 6th grade but I stopped because I started to feel better again but the first winter of 7th grade I got really sad and I was told it was just seasonal which it was for about 3 years. When the winter of my sophomore year came it was different because I was always sad but didnt know why. I tried to find reasons but I could so I decided not to go to therapy or something like that. and now summer going into my senior year and I just feel empty. The seasonal sadness never left after that year and I find myself all the time just feeling blank. I dont really have good thoughts anymore and Ive turned into kind of a pessimist which sucks to say. Im afraid to talk to anyone in person about it besides my mom because people just say im soft or weak. Im just trying to figure out if its just me being brainwashed by social media into thinking im sad or if Im actually depressed. Please help me.",
    "Are depression and anhedonia part of getting older? Most of my post pubescent life I have dealt with depression, but its only gotten more frequent and more extreme as Ive gotten older. Lately Ive been experiencing total anhedonia, where my favorite game, movie, music dont make me feel anything at all. Hanging out with friends is almost exhausting, and I have to fake being positive and laughing, etc. Is this just part of growing up? Is it time to finally start devoting my time to purely practical things? Joy is just for children and young adults? Im 25 years old, btw.",

    "I’m not worried about getting COVID-19, I’m worried about the effects of social distancing and the possibility of quarantine First of all, I want to say that I am incredibly grateful to be young and have an uncompromised immune system. I am very fortunate in this sense. However, I am worried about the effects of things like social distancing and isolation on mental health. That is not to say that I disagree with these measures whatsoever, but like so many other people, being isolated is damaging to my wellbeing. My question is as a college student living in a dorm without a roommate, how can I cope and what are some things I can do in my newfound time from my room?

    "My girlfriend (22f) no longer can find enjoyment in things that we always loved doing Me and my girlfriend are huge music fans and a big part of our relationship is going to gigs. We used to go to a gig almost every week and it was always really good bonding time.

On the way home she admitted to me she doesnt feel any excitement for going to any shows at the moment she doesnt know why and is sad  frustrated as it was one of her favourite things.

Challenges I hate that, I envy my friends, always ready to take on new challenges, being the best version of their self and then they reap the rewards of taking the risk, the opposite happens when I face new challenges, panic attack, complaining, whining and thinking negative constantly. My friends are earning near six digits yet me is stuggling to get by on my meager income, most of the time thinking I might get fired on every messed up I did on the office. I always wanna learn to code so I may better my chance of earning more or atleast a self fulling hobby, when theres an opportunity or time to learn I always hesitate on starting maybe because Im scared like a kid who is afraid of math. Coding is painful especially the debugging part but it is very fulfilling once everything run. When I was a kid I love to draw but my parents enrolled me on a engineering course focusing on IT, so there goes my hobby slowly getting forgotten. I envy my friends in college who are quite into technical stuff, I do love tinkering but when it comes to tinkering something about school there goes me, avoiding it or procrastinating on studying. I know a bit of coding stuff but Im not that good on analyzing instruction, algorithm, pseudocode etc. I struggled at school but manage to graduate with not so good grades average, just passing. So theres that my opportunity getting hired is not so good but still manage to get a job Im thankful they still havent fired me at the office, even tho Im the dumbest, cringiest, lowest confidence employee, slow on getting instruction and full of typos on my email and bad at presentationreport I wanna conquer my fear but anxiety is messing up with me.

    "I’m in a good place in my life rn, why am I feeling this way I cant understand why Im still feeling depressed after so many years even though I took up a hobby I love, going to college for something Im passionate about, in a healthy relationship, and having a stable job. There are days where I feel completely fine, and then Ill have a mental breakdowndepressive episode and usually after one I tend to have more for a week or two. I wont talk for hours, I keep replaying what caused me to feel that way, and then thats it I just bottle it up. I hold onto grudges from my dark past and Its really hard to stop.

I have a really hard time translating my thoughtsfeelings in generaI, literally about anything into words. I just give up on being social sometimes because if I try all I do is stutter. It makes me feel like no one takes me seriously and sees me as intelligent. Because of this Im scared to help, say my opinion, or engage in insightful conversations. I dont feel useful. Though why I do I feel all of this if my life from an outer perspective is more than fine, and privileged. I have a supporting SO, and friends. But, I cant seem to trust them, too.

This is supposed to be my job but it takes 3 days for me to finish a simple translation job that would normally take no longer than 3 hours. I sometimes get too overwhelmed and use machine translation just to get it over with. I know its a horrible thing to do but I just do it.

    "Still on the fence For a long while now I have been depressed and havent really had many close friend and for a little bit hitting a point of literally just 1 semi close online friend and no body else at all, but thats besides the point. For the last probably month or 2 I have been on the fence or just cant decide on what to do with one side being just live a happy life with a tightly knit group of girl and maybe online friends with possibly even a relationship and the other side being suicide. For the longest time Ive been leaning back and forth and thanks to friends Im feeling better some time but thanks to school and alot of punishments and groundings every so often and fairly recently having moved between states pushing me the other way. Im not sure if this is just me or amazingly common but I just dont know what to do any more and I want to be able to land on the right side of the fence on my feet and not fall back into a pit sorry if its an odd analogy. I just really dont know what to do since the only people who ever really reach out to me are semi close friends and just some school mates ending nonsense. All I do if sit around mostly unmotivated to make a difference and better things for myself by simple even doing homework but instead I feel like a lazy bum who uses his only bit of motivation to ask a handful of friends how their day was when I see them only but still feel like Im just pestering them. I mean its been almost half the school year now and the only person who sits next to me because they want to and not because their entire group moved to where I sit is my semi close friend I mention earlier. Ive got nearly no friends, got near nonexistant privacy, no motivation, and the only 2 things that I can always look back on for a reason to keep going are Im my dad only child and he put 15 years of effort into making my last this long and just the simple question of how can I do it quick without it hurting too much or looking a fool.",
    "I don’t want to go swimming at the lake tonight..... But it seems like Ive been crying out for help from every point Ive tried to make, and no one is interested in helping me the way Ive asked. gtgtForget veterans employment allocation program gtgtForget educationemployment pipelines gtgtForget Criminalizing American Political Discrimination. I just wanted to become a fucking professional opera singer, and I wanted help from others making that a reality, after 20 years of working towards it alone werent doing anything to make it a reality. And it seems like nobody cares if it kills me that no matter how hard Ive tried to achieve that goal, Ive always come up short on my own, while everybody else makes themselves a part of these segregating communities against me. So tonight Im contemplating wether I ought to swim out into the middle of the lake and end it all. Nobody wants to help me when Ive asked for help. Nobody wants to implement alternative solutions when Ive tried to present them to people. Nobody wants to even touch me, let alone care if Im on the cusp of deciding to end my life. I dont want to go swimming at the lake tonight. But it seems like nobody wants to stop me because they care. They only want to stop me to save face, and I cant pull myself back when they want to stop me for reasons as selfish as why I want to end my life tonight. So why should I stop for their benefit when they wont help me for mine?",

    "Depression that's caused/exacerbated by my job? Does anyone have any advice for dealing withmanaging depression thats either caused by or exacerbated by their job? My job closed back at the start of the pandemic. I was off work for almost a year and a half. Things were actually starting to look up the last few weeksmonths. I was slowly becoming productive again. Getting closer ot feeling normal. I was actually making progress on my portfolio and studying, to get a job that I dont hate. But my job opened up again last week. Its been 3 days. And already, it feels as though Ive spiralled all the way back down to exactly where I was before. It feels as though this horrible dark cloud is hanging over me again. I feel permantently exhausted. Too tired and on edge to get on with anything. Everything just feels like this big, anxious bad dream, slowly counting down to when Im next working. I just feel a constant dread, waiting for the next shift. I hate my job. I hate the people I work with. I hate my customers. I dont know how to stop feeling like this. But I need to if I ever want to get out of this job. I need to be focused. I need to be able to focus on getting this portfolio done. I need to focus on picking up these qualifications that I need. I need to be able to focus on studying.

    "No longer actively depressed but now I need help beating the apathy. I think my life has been changed forever by the major depressive episode I had last year. I dont think Ill ever feel quite like that again I hope, but its left me a parting gift. I just dont care about most things anymore. This is positive in some ways  it makes me less of a perfectionist for example good enough is fine and I dont get choked up on the little things as much. However, it is also very very negative in other ways. I will go for several weeks without doing my laundry, wait until the last second to do assignments, wont clean, etc. I have NO sense of urgency or shame, particularly urgency, but still have minor guilt after the fact if someone comments on my slobbishness. Like, if someone was coming over and I had an hour to clean I wouldnt get everything done. Id probably pick up a few things and say Im sorry for the mess and feel guilty afterwards that Im a slob. But it wouldnt make me change, however and that annoys me. I know that I do care that these things are happening, but theres a total disconnect from actually caring enough to do them respectably. For example, I would like to clean my room because I enjoy the look and space of a clean room. I know it makes me feel accomplished when I do. But a bigger part of my brain doesnt mind living in squalor because it is so apathetic to everything. I dont like this about myself. I want to be timely and disciplined but I have a hard time caring and almost 0 motivation though its slowly creeping back in occasionally. I feel this may be a discipline issue but I would also like some sense of motivation or ambition. I get like this with my career goals too. I want to want more for myself, but I dont act on it.",

    "Prescribed lamictal for depression? Hi everyone. Apologies for how long this may be. Has anyone been prescribed lamictal for depression WITHOUT having bipolar disorder, along with suffering from low testosterone? A bit of bs  my SO was prescribed lamictal to combat his depression which is also very likely triggered by low T, which we are in the process of trying to treat, and tapered up from 25 mg to 100 mg within a month beginning in June. Prior to starting it, his previous most recent depressive episode was back in December. After he tapered up to 100, within a week, he immediately had a major severe depressive episode and never came out of it. Rather than his normal highs, high level mediums, and mid levels, he bordered on depression the entire time. He began to withdraw completely throughout the entire month of July, and then hit a second major depressive episode that lasted about 2 weeks. Throughout this entire time, he began saying he no longer wanted to be here, doesnt have feelings for me anymore, etc. I urged him to stop taking the lamictal, and although he has reached out to his psych multiple times over the past few weeks, he has yet to hear back so he decided to stop on his own. Since stopping the meds a week ago, Ive seen flashes of the man he used to be coming back  but unfortunately, the medication numbed him to the point where he simply just doesnt want to be here anymore. Were not exactly sure what to expect from this point on  he keeps hoping that the longer hes off, that hell come back to what he was feeling emotionally but at this point we just dont know. Were still awaiting the results from other testing, but for now, were just circling the drain and its legitimately killing me.",

Every time I asked people at the university or government what should I do to fix my problem. They told me to find a friend if I could not figure it out by myself. The problem is most people here dont make a new friend after high school. A new friend wont help me to do stuff. I should get a close friend because I keep getting the answer you can use google or I cannot help you. I dont like to go to a party or bar. I am too depressed to do fun stuff.

So I thought I need to find boyfriend too because no one wants to make a new friend. My psychologist told me to find an online friend. However, when I told my problem to people that I met online in my the new country, most people would reply with, You should search people in real life or You seems put lots of chores to your friend or You should stop searching for boyfriend.

    "Meds helped for a short period of time, but now I have no energy again, and can't do things. Any advice? Long story short I was diagnosed a few months ago, but was in denial because I wasnt actually sad about life, suicidal, etc. I started taking SSRIs LexaproEscitalopram and got a taste of what things could be like. For once, I had all the energy I needed. I didnt spend forever in bed or on the couch deliberating when I wanted to do something, took five minutes to just pull myself up. I no longer felt like I was fighting the weight of my entire body to do simple tasks. After 2 weeks I decided to drink, and thats when it went downhill. For 9 days, I was without energy, spent hours on the couch watching TV each day, not getting up to do much besides work. I doubled my dose, then for a few days it got better. Energy was back, I was doing things, etc. But then it went back to normal. To be clear, Im still not depressed in the classical sense of having negativity about life. I have hope for the future, overall Im pretty happy with where I am. However, I miss having the energy I had. I miss being able to actually work towards my goals and not feel exhausted by basic chores. My mind would go on autopilot, and I didnt have to constantly make decisions to preserve energy. Any suggestions on what I should do next? Ive been on Lexapro for 4 weeks, with a small gap last week where I didnt take it for 2 days straight. Im not sure whether I should seek other meds, keep on my current ones, or even look for other factors when it comes to regaining my energy. Im goign to book a doctors appointment and discuss options, but I wanted to know if anyone else had similar issues, and what theyve done.",

I spent the last 45 minutes carefully putting together my story and tried to tell exactly what happened in the past year, but then the Reddit app decided to commit suicide before me and I am too furious to write all of this shit again, so Ill just get straight to the point I have lost all my friends. I get especially sad because even my best friend we have kissed several times... just doesnt care anymore. My mother doesnt support me at all. She even keeps insulting me and makes things a lot worse. I seriously dont want to live here anymore. Or even living in general, but thats not really the point of this sub. And my father? I dont even know his name. Absolutely no contact whatsoever. I have nobody. I get insanely sad when I see other people having a good time, because Im stuck in this nightmare of not having any social contact whatsoever. But hey, at least I mastered social distancing before this Corona thing happened and I have no problem isolating myself... cause thats exactly what I did for the past nine months or so. I dont even need an external trigger like seeing other people having fun and I just get tears out of nowhere and I constantly think about what has happened to me.

    "A cry for help I live with abusive parents. Im 18, but unable to move out because the Covid situation is really bad in my country. Honestly all my hopes of staying alive were latched on to the fact that Id be able to move out by the end of 2020. But things have been so bad, quarantine has given my parents the right to basically keep me under lock and key under the farce of protecting me. Theyve broken the locks to the door of my room, and often my father is physically abusive. Both my parents are emotionally abusive. Every time my father is done beating me up, for months nobody in my family talks to me. Ive suffered from a complete mental breakdown, for a period of time I believed I was dead. I called a child helpline but I chickened out when they said theyd come over to my house to help me out. I talked to my school counsellor and she made me apologise to my parents for disrespecting them enough to call a helpline against them. I genuinely cannot do this anymore. I havent slept at night for weeks on end. Every time I try to sleep, I wake up suddenly and am unable to sleep again. I wrote down a suicide note yesterday. I made a reddit account today because Ive the tiniest bit of hope left. Ive studied so hard all my life just so Id take a Student Loan and move out for a good college, but all of that has fallen through.

    "Does anyone have advice for how to deal with feeling hollow and disconnected from people? So last night me and one of my buddies, who I am very close to, had a discussion on whats been going on in my head. Lately I have been feeling super sad and borderline suicidal because I have been focusing on my childhood and have come to the realization that I had an abusive childhood. My abuse was mostly psychological and verbal, but it still hurt and I can still feel it to this day. Anyways, last night me and my buddy were discussing how my childhood was abusive and how I try to reach out to others particularly women for comfort, because I feel that I was denied affection by my mother while growing up. All through the conversation, it didnt feel like I was connecting with my friend, only my internal emotions and sorrow. It felt like the mini therapy session we were having was doing little. After leaving I felt hollow on the inside. It lasted till about noon this morning. Felt completely worthless and useless. I was wondering if anyone had tips for what to do when feeling hollow and how to better connect to people.",
    "Should I commit myself to a mental hospital? TW mention of selfharm suicide My depression has gotten really bad the past few weeks. Suicidal and selfharm thoughts are happening more often, and in general I just feel very gloomy and hopeless and anxious and awful. Im going through some pretty huge life changes right now as well, so I am really overwhelmed. I can feel myself slipping into a depressive episode, which hasnt happened in over a year. I am really scared of myself and scared of what might happen if I do not get help soon. I dont think I will act on my thoughts but still, I thought the same thing a year ago and I was wrong. Not asking for pity I just dont trust myself to keep me safe, yk? A month ago I scheduled an appointment with my therapist, but her next available appointment is in another month, and I honesty dont know what will happen if I wait that long to get professional help. Im not saying Im going to kms but Im just scared for my wellbeing. I think staying at a mental hospital would really help me because I just want a break from all of the stressors in my life and I dont want to lay in my bed all day, which is unavoidable at this point. I just want a break from my life and the ability to get out of this mindset or at least prevent it from getting worse. At a hospital, there would be people to help me get better and keep me busy, so I think a mental hospital is the best option. I dont know what else to do, but I really feel like Im a bomb waiting to blow up. What do you think I should do? Im just indecisive and bad at trusting my own judgement. Thanks",

    "Please help me She the new GP knows that I am diagnosed with two chronic painful diseases but she refused to give me any painkillers because just a paracetamol should be enough. I still need to wait a whole month to be able to visit my gyn, the only person that seems to care about my pain. So I am at home with no painkillers, in daily pain and so weak that folding the laundry makes me pant from the effort. I kept going to the same therapist but she is clearly not prepared to deal with chronic pain. I told her three times that i have daily suicidal thoughts and she just changes topic, she wont adress it. Also she gives me stupid advice that is incompatible with my diseases. In our last session she told me that I should consider working as a gardener again. How? Doing basic housechores is a nightmare for me, how I am suposed to do an incredibly physical job???? I am not going back... Then its the issue with my money. As I didnt had a job except the few months gardening in three years I barely have any money left I spent my savings doing a Master before coming ti Belgium. I cant sustain myself and I am compeltely dependent on my partner. I tried aplying for disability but as a migrant not only I dont have any right to get help but the social worker told me that if I dont find a job in two years when my status is reviewed I will likely be kicked out of Belgium. I will become a homeless person. To apply for any help in Spain I just need to work 12 months.... And then there is the issue with my partner. He loves me and tries to suport me.

    "Could you read me? So, since I was a child I was really close and sometimes, hyper protected to my momand the only other child company that I had was my brother, who is 3 years older than me. My brother is gay, and since always have been very feminine, and we used to play imitating pop singers and famous women. So I start to grew really feminine, but pay attention, IM NOT SAYING THAT THE FACT THAT I WAS FEMININE IS BAD. But when I went to school, the thing was not pretty. I spent the years of 4  11 being extremely rejected by my male colleagues and being accused of wanting to be a woman and being gay. Sometimes I was interested in playing soccer like the other boys, but I knew that I would be bullied Everytime I was feminine which was all the time. And these masculine activities would always have been a strange thing for me. My father was really interested in soccer, but never talk to me about it and my mother always rejected soccer just like every other thing my father liked. My brother... Not interested. But I would still play with him of imitate female singers and sometimes, put a fake dress into us. It was pretty much this dynamic until 2010, when I was 9. My brother and I were still playing this, until, in some moment, he started to touch my penis and put my hands on his penis. Im not gonna lie, I knew something wrong was happening, but I didnt actually think about it as sex. I didnt even knew what sex was, until the moment that he lay in the couch and put his penis, expecting me to blow it. Obviously, only now I realised that he wanted me to do oral sex on him, but at the time I didnt really know what he was wanting me to do. So I just stand there, paralized and nervously laughing. Later, he went to my front and put his butt in my penis and start dancing with it. I just felt so uncomfortable but couldnt get out, for some reason. I just remember crying hard at that night, just very disturbed. I just remember this fact very recently, with therapy. Since then it was just blocked from my mind.",

I have been drinking everyday for 1.5 years after we had to break contact. I have also stalked her several times each day looking on facebook who she likes and who likes her. Have talked to her when I see her and how much I love her and how much feelings she has for me. I broke down this christmas after I quit watching pornography and realized she has found a new man behind his back and she is most likely trying to start a relationship with him. I ask her when I see her but I also push her further away. Today I told her I will leave her alone. All that I can think of is ending it. Any hope left?",
    "Unmotivated to do anything besides laying down. I don't want to live like this I F22 get up in de morningafternoon and I watch Netflix. Constantly interrupting my series my being on my phone, so not even enjoying that but I cant stop. I dont work out anymore, I barely go outside, I barely eat, Ive lost so much weight. Im too lazy to even look for a therapist or reply to some people on WhatsApp. Im currently not working bc it had become impossible to do my job bc of my depression. Ive tried working out and hanging out with friends. But I hate working out at home, and I still feel depressed. Crying while Im working out. And then feeling hopeless that it doesnt make me feel any better bc it always used to. When Im with friends I feel annoyed or empty. I dont enjoy anything anymore. Which scared me. Please dont give me advice about how I should just pick up a book or go outside and work out. Or meditating or journaling. I just cant seem to do it, otherwise I wouldve had done it already. I know ways to trigger dopamine and feel better. I just cant seem to make the first step. Im stuck in a loop of sleeping and watching Netflix. Im so tired, does anyone have advice to make the first step out of this? I dont want to live like this",
    "idk how to get better since 7th grade ive cried myself to sleep so many times and ive hurt myself before but i got better, i dont think i was ever diagnosed with depression but i am with anxiety. Im in 9th grade now this has been happening for a little more than 2 years. recently its like the darkness is coming back. my room is a mess and i have no motivation for anything. I keep crying breaking down and im so scared to tell anyone i dont know how to ask for help. i have a counselor but i just tell him im fine and feeling good. Its like i freeze and im physically unable to speak about it. i dont want this darkness to come back but its already here. ive thought about suicide even but i dont want to hurt the few people who really care about me. I know suicide is wrong, i just dont want to live like this anymore, constantly getting hurt and dragged down until im crying so hard my body is literally shaking while i struggle to breathe. its like whenever im happy something happens and my happiness gets ripped away and im isolated with my own thoughts and they just get darker and more complex as time goes on. i feel worthless, like im just a background character im peoples lives. ive been told that im loved and people care about me but when you hear it 1,000,000 times and nobody shows they care it just becomes that same old speech. i dont know how to get better i dont know how to reach out for help. i just cant take this anymore. how do i be happy?",

This is the second time this year that this happens, and every time i wonder how much more can i take, things are not getting better, but im too much of a coward to kill myself.",
    "I need help *TW, self harm thoughts* Things have been stressful at home. My husband lost his job in the summer and neither one of us has been able to find a job. We were denied for government assistance, but my husband gets payment from the VA and unemployment. Because of this stress, my husband and I fight all the time. We love each other, its just so hard. I feel like if I told him about all this it would just add to his stress. Ive thought about putting myself on a psychiatric hold but I havent. I just dont know what to do anymore. I have nobody to talk to. I have a suicide diary in my phone. Ive attempted before when I was 16, so almost 10 years ago. I dont want to commit suicide, I just want something bad to happen to just me and I die. I know this is wrong and not a good sign, I know I need to see a therapist and get on more medicine but we have no insurance. I cant help but feel obnoxious, like a burden, unwanted, unloved, like Im just being used, like Im a terrible wife and mother. I even wrote in my suicide note that if Im ever found dead, to cremate me and throw me in the trash. I dont want to die necessarily because of my boys and my husband, I love them more than anything. I just cant help these thoughts and I feel terrible about it. And my husband has no idea, and neither do my boys. I just want to feel like Im enough, I guess. I dont even know if this makes sense.

    "What do I do for my partner experiencing an extended server depressive episode? My partner 24M and I have been together for over 6 years. We both finished classes last May. I graduated in August and we moved back to our home state. When the pandemic hit, he had to stay at home for months. Hes dealt with depression to some extent his whole life and grad school had already been pretty tough on him. He hit a major depressive episode around last April that hes been in ever since. He hasnt been able to finish his thesis or find the motivation to get a job. He sees a counselor once a week, has been trying out different medications, and even went to an outpatient program for about a week. Nothing has helped him in any substantial way. He says hes doing a little better, which makes me happy, but he still passes most days on his computer. He can only rarely leave our apartment, no longer gets to do the thing he was studying, which he loved, and constantly feels tired. Hes such a wonderful person who doesnt deserve to be in a place like this. I dont know what to do. Every day it gets harder to watch. We talked about getting a tutor to help him finish his thesis, but every call or email takes days. Progress is so slow and I dont know how much more I can take. Who can I call? What can I do? Help.",
    "My life is meaningless, and I’m struggling really hard with pain and emptiness. Anyone feel the same way...? Every day is just bleh. I have no purpose, no reason to live, so every day ends up feeling empty. I dissociate heavily all the time, so it feels like my life isnt even mine anymore, in the passenger seat of my own body, as if my strange hands and floating disembodied voice dont belong to me. I dont recognize the stranger in the mirror. I want to cry with every ounce of my being, but I just cant, no matter how hard I try. There is no release. Basic personal hygiene requires so much mental energy that it just ends up getting neglected entirely. How can I think about brushing my teeth when I dont even want to get out of bed? Hell, when I dont even want to wake up? Its all way too much to put into words, and this post is already pretty long. Sorry for rambling. Thanks for making it to the end of this novella.",
    "Do I have depression or am I overthinking? Ive been thinking about if I have some type of depression for a while but put off asking people about it because i dont want to seam like the person who feels sad and all of a sudden thinks theyre depressed. However I think its about time I ask. Every couple of days Ill have moments that can last 30 minutes to an hour or longer where Im not happy, not necessarily sad... just unhappy? even if the main feeling unhappy isnt happening if my friends ask me to go out with them after school I think about going along and then think that I wont have fun and start to dread the idea. This even happens with my girlfriend who I love but if she asks me if i want to come over the next day I will never say a definite answer, instead Ill say maybe or possibly just because I dont know how Ill feel like the next day. I also feel that nothing will bring me joy like video games, i will quickly get bored of them in these moments and try to think of something to do but everything I think of doing doesnt seem as if it would make me any less bored. In the mornings Ill think of the day ahead and absolutely dead it sop much that the night before I prep myself by saying why the next day is going to be good, this sometimes helps a bit but i usually run out of energy. I feel like i have a fair amount of symptoms of a less severe depression but from everything Ive read it seems that an episode lasts around at least a week. Im sorry if this is me just overreacting andor that this is rude about me even thinking i might have depression and that i know nothing what others go through... but I dont know and thats why Im asking. ampx200B also sorry if this is horrible written, its currently 1229am and dont want to read over it and correct it...",
    "Desperately need support Ive been struggling with mood and motivation problems for a long time but now this has been flowing over in back and joint problems, fatigue and some small signs of inflammation. My heads talking, dreaming and analyzing all the time, my memory and focus are down and just dont know what to do anymore. Some days all I can do is lay in bed and be anxious, other days Im full of energy and over enthusiasm with bad some nights rest as a result. Ive took my walks in nature, tried meditation for a long time, went to the spa and went to the gym. The gym helped me getting motivated, but later on gave me sleep, focus and fatigue problems. My heads full of memorys, hints and its all just like one big spiderweb. Meditation helped me with the sleep and focus problems, but I couldnt get to the core and discover what I really want. Im an epileptic and have PTSD and already have memory issues due to the epilepsy, so when Im at the psych I forget a lot of stuff andor forget to react to what the psych just said so I can complete the story. This has been going on for more than 2 years now and its wrecking my life apart. Im in physical pain, talk gibberish to others, Im hallucinating, Im more insecure than ever, talking to myself, have pushed all my friends and fun things aside thinking about death and suicide a lot, and already have solid plans for it and Im am afraid that my body is just breaking itself down somehow so there is no other way out than suicide.

I was rediagnosed this year with dysthymia used to be major depression and started Prozac, which basically just gave me mild side effects and didnt help at all. I switched to Wellbutrin and didnt even have any side effects, I felt like I was taking a sugar pill in the morning because it also didnt help at all. I start Effexor tomorrow and am setting up counseling, but Im literally ruining my life right now. In past semesters, I was able to scrape through with a B average and go to most of my classes.

    "Thought I would share this here Hi, my name is Sebastian and I really dont know how to start this post, maybe because Im afraid to be called whiny or whatever, but the truth is Ive been feeling pretty down recently so I thought I would share what Ive been feelingthinking this past 3 months or so. It is a well known fact that 2020 has been nothing short of horrible, but the reality is that, for me at least , it didnt start that way. Beginning of 2020 was maybe the best Ive ever felt in my life. To provide a little more context, Im 19 rn, but back at January February I was still 18 and about to graduate from high school which I eventually did, with good grades, but heres the issue I graduated from a international German school which educates based on the German system Abitur which in short were some difficult exams that I studied my ass of to pass. Abitur also presented me with the possibility of going abroad for college. All my short life Ive felt kinda pressured to go abroad to study, since my father did it and always talked about how amazing it was, and my school was filled with posters of study in Europemostly Germany its a life changing experience. And so I felt on top of my game and started among at the very top architecture in such places like Madrid,Berlin,Stuttgart,etc but most of all I wanted Barcelona because it felt so perfect on paper, like the best of the best , world wide known, top level technology, state of the art campus, and of course the city itself is an architectural delight arguably the most famous architect , Gaudí is from Barcelona. Looking back now, I was naive and didnt appreciate what I had back home , but I had to prove the ones who bullied and looked down on me back in my school days , that I was better than them, and that was my first of many mistake I went there looking for revenge so to speak. Then everything developed so quickly I had barely any time to think , to my awe I got accepted in BarcelonaTech, I found a nice little bedroom on a student housing that was just beside Campus and I started preparing for my departure , which was going to be mid September bc the University had arranged some introdution activities for new comers. It all seemed perfect, like it was made FOR me.",

Today I woke up at 630, and as soon as I got up I was already battling with the idea of whether or not to go to school, and this thought stayed with me throughout breakfast, throughout my shower. I told my brother, who I normally walk to school with, that my alarm woke me up late and that hed better walk to school ahead of me if he didnt want to be late, so he left.

    "I ( 26 female ) have decided to take care of my severely depressed younger brother (20m ) by letting him move in with me last week and need some tips. He is 20, however never grew up or matured properly due to lack of socialization... Never experience love, only had friends before his teens and made virtual friends via his gaming on Xbox until this day... While my mom drank and my dad was aggressive all these years, my brother would go hide in his room gaming all night and sleping all day and hasnt left his room until child protective services took him out for 1.5 years. And they only did because I told them what was going on... Anyways. Fast forward and now he is finally with me. I want to be the best support but I havent stopped feeling anxiety since he moved in. Like I am not eating as well and I am worried this will make me feel isolated or ruin my other relationships  dont have many left haha but 23 but also worried for him too as he wont eat unless I tell him to, wont move his body unless I tell him to etc... Having him here reminds me of the misery of my parents and my childhood. Because he is unfortunately the result of a dysfunctional family. I dont want to turn into my mom where I cook and clean all the time  she is a functioning alcoholic but gets highly abusive when she drinks but still cooked and cleaned  even though I cooked for.myself growing up as Im vegan and she didnt want to cook vegan food for me when I turned 19. I want my brother to feel confident but he doesnt because he dropped out of highschool twice as a result of mental illness growing up. Before coming to stay with me he was starring to refuse food and had severe psychomotor retardation  cant get our of bed  and like I maybe mentioned before he has not gotten out of bed in a decade expect for when CPS got involved .

    "I'm a College Student Struggling with Depression Ive been struggling with depression for years. Im hoping to graduate in the spring, but I wont if I dont get myself back into shape. Last year wasnt so bad, but its really hit me hard this semester. I had to withdraw from a class and am behind in all my others. I keep making lists of the things I need to do and try to take them one at a time, but since Ive missed so much class and everything is already going to be penalized for being late, I feel like its becoming impossible. Getting help right now isnt really an option. I was supposed to get a scholarship this year but its delayed because of some confusing financial thing, so Im out of cash. I dont have enough for even one copay, or pay for transportation to see a psychologist. Professors are emailing me about assignments and Ive been giving excuses for months. The school wont give me accommodations because my diagnosis is too old. I dont get financial or emotional support from my family so thats out. All I can do is try to go to class and do the work, which makes it all the more stressful. I feel like Im always loosing time and never making progress. I try to do a little here and there but I cant seem to keep up my focus or motivation. I just want to be able to get the things done and feel better, at least about being a semidecent student.

To this day, Im quite afraid to ever try for it, in thinking Im making it up, you last this long why now you need them. So yeah, I dont ever get it and it alwaysjust something I hate myself for. I just feel like Im lazy and crap because I cant focus on. I did end up getting half of the credits credit for GED, where I am at you dont have to take all the test at once. You can take each test one at a time. Im only needing math and science which both I have a tough time focusing on.

    "Depressed International Student; need help Hi, Ill try to explain my situation as best as I can and I will highly appreciate if you can read it completely. In any case, Ill try to summarize everything in a TLDR at the bottom. Thanks for your time. ampx200B I am an international student who is stuck overseas in my home country India due to COVID from the last one and half year. I am studying in a good university on a student loan which is huge. I come from a lowermiddle class family and my parents cant even speak English. My parents have very conservative Indian mentality and it is impossible for them to understand my situation. Just after my high school, I was selected into very prestigious engineering colleges in India called IIT. I studied there for an year and got super depressed as I came to understand how the real life is. I decided to take a transfer to a very good university in Australia. I thought it would make me feel better but it did come with a hefty student loan. I was a kid I guess, I dont think there is anything that can make me feel better. I am currently in my last year and working towards writing my honours thesis. I have been pretty stressed about general life and how exactly I will repay my loan and live a normal life. I have tried applying to a lot of internships but I got more than 50 rejections already and I have no more motivation to apply anywhere now. I dont feel anything at all. The only reason why I study or do any work is to get high marks. Thats it. Very recently last month or two, I have been even slacking off in the study part. I have also started smoking cigarettes and doing marijuana edibles every other day. Every day, I wake up at 10 already tired and swearing about everything in my mind, I live at my parents home rn. I attend a few zoom group project meetings, staying silent mostly and trying to look like I did the minimal amount of work to not get thrown out of the group. Then I try to feel better, make a huge list of assignments coming up and write down how much is each of them worth. I start working on something and feel it is totally pointless.",
    "If going through a depressive episode, should I first focus on making myself happy? Last couple of days Ive been seriously stressed, have felt overwhelmed, insecure, had some very out of character suicidal thoughts and have just been generally on the verge of tears. Whats the best course of action when in crisis? Am I suppose to make my self feel better and avoid such horrible sad thoughts and then tackle my problems? Is temporary avoidance bad?

    "Help me help him My boyfriend and I recently moved in together. He moved from a fairly metropolitan area to my very rural small town. This transitions been tough for him and hes slipped into what Id call a depressive state. Hes typically a very social and active person but more recently hes become a hermit. I struggle to even get him off of the couch. I encourage him often to get up and do things with me but it isnt usually received well. He wants to get up but he just doesnt know how to get himself going. How can I be helpful to him without parenting him?",
    "Is it all even worth it? Just to start it off, I DO NOT WANT TO KILL MYSELF. But recently Ive just been overwhelmed and I dont have anyone with whom I could share this. So basically before the winter breakweek ago everything was going great. I went on a friendly date with my crush that went well, my engineering contest was going great my biggest dream is to get into MIT and I am capable and school was fine. Fast forward to a few days ago when it all started going to shit. My crush left for a ski trip and gone cold, dont know if I did something wrong I have Aspergers and Im a typical stereotypical nerd, aka no dating skills, basically I dont pick up on the subtle hints at all or is it just the trip, I cant stop thinking about it and her, its very hard for me to find girls that I would call compatible, basically someone with a deep passion for something that basically defines them. That makes me distracted from my work which stresses me out even more. The contest Im taking part in is also kinda collapsing and Im very worried that Ill loose thousands of hours of CAD work and 500 in my currency 1500 that I invested into the project that I was promised back. Another team posted pictures that made me really anxious because of their complexity compared to the other teams and given their perfect score they might win. And the school part, my homeroom teacher that basically told me that he doesnt give a shit about me or my goals and that my reasons for joining this contest are wrong and that its all my fault that its gone to shit and that Im a tyrant who takes away all the work from my teammates which is totally false because they havent done a thing and basically dont care, anything I proposed I was told to do myself and most of the tasks of the other teammates also partially fell on me, like Hey can you help him with that? It got so bad that I had to get outside help which made my teacher even more mad so he started insulting me straight to my face, as well as behind my back, saying he doesnt want anything to do with me and basically disrespect my entire work and from my schoolmates tell me he is quite proud of it, it got to the point where my parent had to go and talk with the school.",
    "I'm drowning I feel like Im drowning. The past couple days I finally felt better... last night it hit me like a ton of bricks. I cant stop crying. It took all the energy I had to go to get coffee and lunch today... even that i took a couple bites and put leftovers up. I just want to crawl in a hole. Im so fucking alone. I cant be open to anyone when my depression gets bad because my whole life if it was bad my family thought I was just wanting attention. I feel like a burden and a waste of space.",

I try to find time to do things that make me happy, but with two young kids it is hard to find the time. When I do, Im happy for a little bit. But then the reality of having two kids and a fairly oblivious husband creeps back in. I tell him how Im feeling, but it always feels like he thinks Im just whining or feeling sorry for myself. He kind of helps with the kids,but usually I have to ask. I am getting to the point where I feel like if I have to ask for help with the same shit every day, it isnt even worth it to ask. Ive also explained that to him. Things get better for a few days, maybe a week, then we go back to me having to ask again. I love my husband and kids, but Im at a breaking point. I want to feel like myself again. Hell, Id even settle for feeling like Im not just a mom. That cant be my whole identity, but I have no idea how to feel any different. Nothing works.",
    "I lost my job and potentially my career due to a deep depression. This went on for over 3 months. Eventually, i got the call i was expecting, with cracks in his voice, my boss informed me that HR had declined any further leave and that I was being let go for violation my companies attendance policy. I was heartbroken, but numb. My year internship had been for nothing now, my countless hours of studying for my FINRA exams, all my efforts were gone because i couldnt bare to face the world. It was another punch to the gut when I received my U5 in the mail, something that stays with your for the rest of your Financial industry career, stating I had been fired for not following attendance policies. Fast forward to 2 months after everything, I was able to get on my partners insurance and pay 500 out of pocked for a psychiatrist. I was put on mood stabilizers and further diagnosed with BPD as well. I had officially run out of handouts from my partner and I had to get a new job back in the industry I despised. I was making 15hr I used to have a salary of about 75K Base and I am miserable. Im not making enough money, and I am terrified to apply for any financial services job that will see my U5 and just move on to the next candidate. Im starting to feel that if I stay at my current jobindustry, i will fall right back into that deep depression. My new job offers amazing insurance and I am able to see a therapist and psychiatrist which I am seeing regularly but I dont know if insurance benefits are a reason to stay at a company if you are absolutely miserable. I just want some advice, guidance. I would love to go back to school or get a certification but Im just getting stabilized financially again and I just cant.

    "This is gross but I really need help Ive just woken up from a months long depression hole today. I was getting presentable, going to work and taking care of my cat but thats pretty much it.

    "My life is amazing, but I'm a miserable asshole. I'm not sure what to do. I have been in quite a few abusive relationships romantic and platonic so I know theres some trauma Im still working through. But the problem is that despite all the progress Ive made and all the wonderful things in my life, I cant feel any of that wonderfulness. I see my wife, I know I love her, I can act on that love, but I cant... feel it. Its just numb. I watch a show that makes me happy, and I just cant... feel that happiness. Its like Im constantly, permanently disconnected from anything positive, and no matter how healthy my habits might become or what attitudes I choose to adopt, neutral is the best I feel about anything. On top of that, its like Ive forgotten how to have fun. I have hobbies that I never pursue. Ill buy something, say a video game, and never play it. I have a pile of books Ive bought but never read, and sadly, its not because Im just too slow at getting through them. Its like, when I try to do something that isnt work, I get these voices not literal in my head screaming you shouldnt be doing this. The more I try to have fun, the worse I feel about it. I mentioned I just graduated college  three years at a community college couldve been 1 12, thanks shitty counselling department! and 2 years at UCSD. I graduated  though there wasnt a ceremony or anything thanks Covid  and felt... nothing. I didnt feel pride, or relief, or anything. It was like Id just finished washing the dishes  okay, thats done, whats next? A couple of years back, I got my black belt in a very difficult martial art after 7 years of training three times a week. The test was a fourhour ordeal that literally involved, at one point, blood streaming down my face as I fought a marine twice my size they paused it for a few minutes so I could clean myself up.

    "Everyone ghosting after some time Hey, eh, life is shit. Whenever it goes good, in next few days sth shit happens. Now I dont want to even have good moments, because after them there are 2x more worse. Last few months I lost my job, ended weirdest relationship ever which I still miss, suspicion of stomach cancer. Everything at 21y old. Besides that my parents literally hate me and only few friends stayed with me, rest faded out because I wasnt going to drink vodkaalcohol almost everyday. And the worst part of last monthsyears are new peoole who I meet. Most of them were really cool, always said they will never ghost but after some time they were doing same shit, which fucking hurts when you get to know someone close. Now I feel like fucking shit, being on knees in front of toilet, vomiting blood, not having energy to go out, when few months ago I wanted to start marathon. Only positive side of last months is reducing amount of drugs throwing cigs, max few beers per month etc. And also withdrawing from being addicted to halcion. Now Im also really scared about university, because there wont be online lessons, but normal. And in current state its hard to go up from bed, not talking about living as normal student. Nothing on Earth basically makes me happy now, Im just living because Im too scared to end this? So I just let the life pass. But I will probably not live much longer naturally so.

    "Depression Treatment Options MDD for the past 2 years. Bipolar, depression, and anxiety all run in my family very prevelently, but none have received any kind of treatment except lithium for a bipolar grandparent. Im currently considered treatment resistant. Onto my 5th antidepressant now. Done SSRIs, SNRIs, Wellbutrin, and Buspar dont know why my doc thought that one was a good idea, I dont have anxious symptoms. Im beginning to think oral medications are not the route for me unless perhaps a tetracyclic or MAOI works out. Id be interested in trying lithium because I know it has helped a family member and I have also been mis?diagnosed as bipolar, so maybe it could work? Im going to bring that up to my new psychiatrist tomorrow. TMS and ECT sound like great options except the price tag. My insurance would only cover half, so Id still be paying upwards of 10k for treatment. Not something I can afford. So I need to look for something else that I could possibly try thats cheaper. And yes, Ive done psychotherapy and group therapy, and it doesnt help in the slightest. Ive looked into alternate medicine like acupuncture, although i doubt its efficacy my theory is that it works solely due to the placebo effect. and that hasnt even worked for things i thought would work for me. Perhaps clinical trials could be an option, but thats not necessarily treatment for me. Ive been suggested to try an outpatient program or check into a psych ward but Ive heard bad things about them. Plus, Im not sure how my treatment would be any better than just going to a psychiatrist on my own. Please let me know your experiences or suggestions! I am willing to try anything to get better, and Ive been researching my options, but have heard very little experience past the basic medication side of things.",

Ive been out of work for a year and a half now, and my BA and MA arent very useful in terms of finding a job.

    "Advice coming off meds Hi, just wanting some advice. Over the past year I developed pretty significant anxiety and depression, and after a while, my friends at uni noticed and advised that I seek professional help. I was then prescribed antidepressants sertraline, which Ive been taking for the past few months. Things overall improved over the summer, but about a week ago I decided to stop taking them, as I dont feel very comfortable being reliant on medication, and I feel like my life is at a significantly better point now. I recognise that this was probably the wrong call, and if things get worse again I will get back on them. However, since coming off them, Ive been experiencing almost constant headaches and dizziness, to the point where I am sometimes unable to walk, meaning its difficult leaving the house, or meeting up with anybody, as I feel like I cant maintain the required amount of energy. This means my lifestyle has reverted to what it was like at the worst points of the last year, being unable to go outside, and feeling unable to talk to anybody on any medium. Does anybody know how long these effects last or if theyre normal?",

Ive been seeing a therapist for a while now, but more recently I asked my psychiatrist starting an antidepressant. We both agreed it would give me the best chance of seeing any improvement that I have at this point. Heres the thing though, Im really nervous about taking them.

Recently, I anticipated that going back online and mentioning my suicide attempt would cause at least some kind of reaction from these mutuals, but nothing actually did happen. Since then I have completely shut down and cant function when I need to the most exam season, its all just bad timing. But Im more angry at myself because I basically asked for this, and when I didnt get the reaction I wanted I caused my own downfall. I know that Ive caused my own isolation, my depression wants me to push people away so badly, and when I see people not making an effort on their side, people who I felt they would, its just tearing me apart. I really, really just want to disappear. I feel horrible for wanting people to feel guilty, but Im so exhausted of feeling this way and I only want to be bitter and angry at the world.",
    "Thought I would share this here It all seemed perfect, like it was made FOR me. Problems started emerging in September, first of all it was difficult to find flights to Spain, but then on the night me and my father were supposed to fly, he checked to see if he had all the documents with him, and sadly his pass was past due. So I had to fly alone, and I had no time to process what had just happened, I had to stay focused. Then I received a mail from college stating that those introduction weeks had to be canceled due to Covid casing rising again in the city. I tried to pull through thinking all would be better once classes started, but soon after I got a second mail stating that classes would be mixed so almost all classes would be takes online bar Maths and Physics. Then the third mail came in stating that classes would be taking Online until further notice, possibly until March or february. At this point I had a full on emotional breakdown all the anxiety, nostalgia, frustration and anger came rushing in , I felt I was lied to by College authorities, though they dont control covid , they did tell me that for newcomers classes would be given at campus. So after 1 month I decided I had enough of my European adventure and came back home. This is where I guess my depression started. I now have been accepted by a local Uni, but it doesnt feel rewarding, as it should , it feels empty. I feel like a coward, a loser , like I was not good enough and gave up on my dreams. Like I will never have another opportunity to leave , and that I will be stuck here forever wandering what if... most of all I feel disappointed in myself and extremely sad, and though I do have my familys support, I feel like they dont quite get me, and frankly like they are running out of patience. I dont know, I guessed I needed a space to vent and let my thoughts and feelings out, although it may be silly.

    "Making the same mistake years later. I knew she was back in town, later on I ended up at a house party where I got in to a very bad state with drugs and alcohol. And out of all the placed I could of met her again she walked in to the kitchen where I was dashing out lines of cocaine in a state where I could barely stand or speak. I tried telling her I wasnt the man I was when we first met, but of course she didnt believe it, why would she ? Somehow I managed to achieve some sort of success with her. We danced and kissed etc. But shes probably just lonely since coming back to town since most of her friends are gone away. We never had sex that night but I couldnt have sex even if I wanted to due to state I was in. I woke up next morning and all my feeling for her came back, all the love it took me years to forget, but I knew that it was over, it was just a one night thing. It crushed me. All these years breaking away from my habits wasted when it came down to a person it mattered. I was still the same lying drug addict in her eyes as I was 4 years ago. Its been a week and I feel empty, only emotion I have is constant hint of anger and sadness in me. I stopped eating or doing anything except working , I work 95 and then I go to my garage where I work on projects and drink alcohol until am I able to sleep. Maybe I am still the same scumbag I was 4 years ago. Iv been having suicidal thoughts but I know I cant do that since I need to look after my family. I would rather suffer myself then let my family suffer. At first I thought it was just a comedown from drugs since I havent touched them in so long. But I still miss her more and more everyday. I have dreams about her at night where we are happy together. I messaged her a few times but shes always busy and takes a long time to reply. Im just so lost, all these years to recover just to slip back into my old days when it mattered the most. She gave me an opportunity to fix what I once broke but instead I proceeded to ruin it further.",
    "I'm seriously considering suicide again. I wont label my social issues, as I havent got a clinical diagnosis like anyhting else on this list, but I think it fits more into the antisocial category than asocial or social anxiety, because of my negative and possibly misanthropist views. I have 2 past suicide attempts, once by asphyxiation, and the other by insulin overdose. Now, Im just wasting away, induging myself and slowly poisoning myself. My only friends 3 or 4, whom Ive always valued highly, are distancing away from me slowly, after nearly 6 years of friendship to be honest, I dont blame them, because Im fucking weird to hang around.

His father my moms younger brother by 1 year is the current president 33rd of the KoreanAmerican Association of Chicago and a Northfield Township trustee. My cousin has a better social life, better health he is ripped as one would describe, and taller than me, while I am barely keeping my muscle mass together. Im 56kg, 170cm, has better looks than me, is a better student no problems in school and is just allaround a better person than me. People follow him around, and as much as it hurts my pride to admit this, I am envious that girls just follow him around. My family isnt very supportive neither. My aunt and uncle cares for me I hope but treats me as if I were some lazyass scum, because their son is objectively better than me, even though I am doing my fucking best, trying not to die from a DKA every day. I lost 56 pounds in 2 weeks, all muscle mass, because I dont have much body fat. I excercise semiregularly 45 mins a day, 34 hours a wekk, maybe, I study, I do what everyone else does, and I even put more time into it all possible because I assist school once a month now, all assignemnts are submitted through a school intranet.

I have symptoms of an anxiety disorder dry mouth, slurred speech and I dont know how to converse as a normal human. I feel like people check their phones or look away more when theyre talking to me, which makes me feel even worse. My life sucks.",
    "I'm Not Coping Im having a really hard time coping lately. I went no contact with my borderline mom and in doing so cut contact with my family as well. I am also off of my arthritis medication which has brought back 247 nonstop pain. I can feel my mental health dwindling with each tick of the clock and I just keep going down deeper into the hole. Ive been sick and stuck at home since Valentines Day and it feels like a live rendition of the Yellow Wallpaper as I slowly give up and give in to my depression.",

    "We were engaged. He left me for a 19 year old he has been talking to online for the past 3 months They only saw each other in person once at the time, had each other added on Snapchat ever since, but never talked. When the Tokyo Olympics finally started, she posted a story on Snapchat about Brazil losing in a game of volleyball or something, thats what he told me at least. Since him and I always watched the games together when we could, he knew about it and replied to her story making a joke. Theyve been talking ever since. He told her about me and our story, that we were engaged, etc, and she thought it was awesome and asked to follow me on Instagram. I accepted it. She was extremely nice to me in the beginning and also replied extremely fast. After a few days talking on there she asked me for my WhatsApp number. Ill confess that I didnt really want to give her because I barely knew her and I dont like giving my number to random people. But I didnt want to be rude so I ended up giving her my number and we started talking there. After just a little while talking on WhatsApp, she asked me if we wanted to do a video call with her us 3. I thought she was moving way too fast with intimacy with us, but I asked my fiancé if he wanted to and he said it was up to me. I ended up accepting it. It was actually nice and we called once or twice more. Well, so this situation of her being friends with us lasted for about a month, but around the beginning of October I started being suspicious about some things with the two. We used to call every night before I slept Im at GMT3 and hes at GMT5, and he started giving excuses to go to sleep earlier because he was feeling sick, tired, etc, and I believed him. Well, all those times he was ending our call earlier to call her for 3 hours straight. They also called at other times during the day that I never knew about.",

    "Low-functioning Depression &amp; Exercise Ive struggled with depression for quite a while now, and certain times I find motivation comes easier than others. However, for the past three months I have been at a very low point, I shower once a week and I struggle to brush my teeth and hair. Thats where Im at. Last July I started seeing a personal trainer for the goal of weight loss and I havent seen her for 6 weeks now. My mom is encouraging me to go back, for my mental healths sake, but right now I have no interest in exercise. Also, I fear that if I go back my goal of weight loss will prioritize over my goal of benefiting my mental health. I know I inevitably kick myself for not going back, but the dread is over powering my rationale. I would prefer to just to 10 minute workouts on my own in my pyjamas, but I know I probably wont. Personal training just seems like a lot. What should I do? If you have been or know someone who is lowfunctioning, has personal training been helpful? Or exercise in general? Is it better to start small when youre low functioning or just throw yourself in? I appreciate any thoughts and advice as really I only have my moms perspective right now and she doesnt totally understand the depressed brain. Thank you",
    "Will it ever go away? (Self Harm/ suidical thoughts-- Trigger warning!) Will it ever go away? I thought that I beat this sht, but what happened last night said otherwise. I have suffering from depression for a whole year! It started last year, 2 semesters ago, with it being compounded with ADHD led to an emotional devastation. It had gotten so bad that I would self harm everynight using an absurdly sharp keys to scratch my upper right arm I am a lefty and one night I decided to cut myself three times using scissors. During that semester I would often write I wrote like Da vinci to make it harder for others to read! things about the emotional pain and that I wanted to die. After the semester was over my mom pressured me to get help. I was put on meds. After awhile and an additional medication I felt better, though took awhile to feel better. Fastforward to today, well last night. When I just bursted into tear and cried myself to sleep, and lately I been having passive suicidal thoughts and I sometimes wish that one night that I will go to sleep and not wake up. In addition, to ADHD and depression I also got GAD and I had a panic attack today YAYYAYAYAYYAY!!. My depression is coming back, and now I have issues with GAD, and the only thing I want is for my depression and GAD to go away! I am tired of suffering, depression and GAD needs fck off!",
    "I'm fed up I take my meds, I go to therapy, but nothing is sticking. I do everything right but I keep failing again, and again. I know I need to get out of my own head. I know I need to break out of this unhealthy way of thinking, but my brain just wont do it! I hate how I come across as lazy. Im exhausted. This is my third attempt at trying to get my Bachelors. I only have a semseter left. Each time I try to graduate, something horrible happens, I get hospitalized for suicide, I get assaulted, and my mother dies. Now Im constantly bracing myself for more suffering, and I end up creating it by panicking instead of doing my assignments. Im making this harder on myself then it has to be. I feel guilt for being a financial burden on my father, I feel shame for not moving on with my life like my peers. I hate not having friends, and being a hermit. I really dont want to move back in with my father, because he hoards, and my depression will only get worse. All I want to be is financially independent. I want to be a functioning member of society. Its also been a struggle to get my ADHD meds, Im a mess, and cant keep events straight. I got the date wrong yet again. I keep sleeping the day away. It took all my effort to put on jeans, and cook myself breakfast this morning. One load of dishes and Im exhausted. Im sick of it! I just want to be okay!",
    "I am sad, alone and scared. Ive never been properly diagnosed with depression but I am currently feeling very depressed. A few years ago when I was younger amp my parents were going through a divorce I was severely miserable, would have large bouts of anxiety amp often contemplated ending my life. It was a sad time in my life but I am glad to say that I got through it and have been doing great for the most part and have hardly felt anxious since. However recently I have been feeling really down amp depressed. All I want to do is sleep and I eat because I am sad and bored, and then I become sad because I eat too much. I have gained weight and am so insecure. I have been skipping my uni classes because I have no friends there and my degree is hard and it all makes me so sad. With all my friends heading in different directions I just feel so alone. I think my family have noticed and say things that are kind of cruel, but I know they mean well. They think I have obsessive compulsive tendencies because I tend to pick at my face often amp struggle to stop. I just dont want to let anyone down amp I am afraid to take the steps to become better because I know it will disappoint my family if I decide to leave uni for example. But most importantly Im scared of going back to how I was years ago, I never want to feel that way again. Ive never reached out for professional help either and dont have the money for therapy. Part of me would feel also ashamed in a way if I got professional help. I hate the idea that something may actually be wrong with me, and I hate the idea of having to take meds. I just feel so lost and conflicted. I feel like I know what I need to do but its so hard to do it and remain consistent. If anyone has any advice at all it would greatly appreciated. Also, thank you if you read through it all.",
    "Scared of starting antidepressants Im a 22 year old guy Currently in college studying economics, in my 5th year. I struggle with depression, GAD and minor OCD. I have major issues with motivation. Most of the time, especially when Im stressed out the most, I lack any motivation whatsoever. There are a couple fields that interest me, but the college experience has been very stressful for me altogether. However, Im not motivated to do anything. Starting a new degree doesnt motivate me because Im not passionate about anything in particular, except for statistics, and my degree is the best to undertake a specialization in that which I want to do. Very often, if not almost everyday, its hard to get up from bed. Its hard to eat. Its hard not to cry. I have the full support from my parents, I have friends, I dont struggle financially yet Im profoundly unhappy. I hate myself as well. I have suicidal ideation very often. Im scripted benzos but I want to drop them for antidepressants. Benzos make my anxiety better and make me motivated and cheerful but theyre not something designed for long term use. So I want to ask my doctor for an antidepressant script, since he is a very kind and understanding guy and Im sure hed script me what he thinks is best however Im profoundly scared of side effects. I have more exams in one month and Im scared to be hit by side effects during them and that they might make it even worse. Idk if its irrational. But thats my thought process.

    "Breaking up gave me depression.. and I want to speak my mind.. please be nice. I turned to religion for answers, I have been blessed to receive answers, I know 100 that this is all going to blow over, and the sun will shine on me once more. But sadly, it did not take the pain away. The pain is very real and I was trying to numb it with WHATEVER helps. I did not write this to blame my ex. I have read and searched for answers to know that, this isnt her fault. I shouldnt blame her for making a call that I couldnt make. I couldve walked away when the signs came out, but I didnt. Yes, she caused the initial heartbreak, but I am 100 responsible for the actions I have taken upon myself, and how I treat myself postbreakup. It took months for me to realize this, but it doesnt make things easier. I am still looking for ways to keep moving on with my life and try to be the best version of myself. I see clearly now because the clouds that have clouded my judgment had disappeared. Its somewhat amazing to see how far I have gone, yet scared of whats going to come. I have seen so many things from this depressing perspective, and I am not satisfied with the person I am. No one really knows what drove her away. Nonetheless, I aspire to be a better person in many ways. I aspire to be better in terms of mental health, relationship with God, and my character. This crazy experience in my life has taught me to appreciate loved ones, parents in particular. Only when God takes away someone that I care about, I realize how lucky I am to have loving parents and supportive highschool friends that have kept in touch with me through this tough time. Yes, they can help me, but they can only do so much. I dont revolve around their life because they have their responsibilities and commitments. However, at the end of the day, I know that I am responsible for my happiness and I have to drag myself to the place I want to be.",
    "Anyone here have reverse seasonal affective disorder - i.e.: summer depression? If so, could use some advice For the past two summers like clock work around the last week in July I have been hit with the above  I dont know what else it is other than reverse SAD. It usually starts with a general few months of feeling good and stable  meaning Im feeling normal, motivated and generally happy with some dips that Im used to for the most part. The past two summers I will have a really good dayweek whatever and then one morning Ill wake up and feel hungover or in a fog even though I havent done anything to bring this on like drinking, using substances. Also, Im quite active physically  so thats also strange. Whats even more frustrating are the physical symptoms my legs feel like noodles and I feel like I cannot wake up despite caffeine and Adderall. Two summers ago it hit me at a physical therapy appointment literally felt so incredibly off that I had to sit down for a minute. The PT said maybe it was menopause. Wanted to throttle him, lol. In a span of 24 hours I went from a normal mood to really off. It progressed to the point where I spent most of August in bed  only getting up to use the washroom and do basic things. I vividly recall literally crawling to clean the cat box my body felt so heavy. I actually felt paralyzed. I also recall having to return and item I borrowed from a friend and having to drive and being so out of it I wasnt sure I could. It felt as if I was wading through deep water or mud. Last summer I wasnt expecting it Bc I thought the summer before was just a fluke or hormones but I vividly recall the day before I was very productive did a lot around the house and generally felt up. The next day when I got out of bed, my legs were like noodles going down the stairs and I felt off. I was sitting drinking coffee when my husband looked at me and asked if I was ok. I thought I was just tired, but as the days progressed I got worse and worse. It took me months to recover Bc I couldnt find any type of add on medication that I could tolerate that helped.",
    "How do I gain confidence when almost every person I've talked to has put me down for my appearance? Sure Im doing all this self care for myself, but I need to feel accepted by someone. Ive never had a girlfriend, never had a best friend, never had someone I spiritually resonate with. Ive never had anyone. I was physically abused by my father and Ive been completely alone ever since. My entire existence has only been suffering and I dont understand why Id be put here just to feel pain and suffering all while completely alone. I just bottle up all my emotions and pretend it doesnt bother me but of course its eating away at my sanity. I dont have to be gorgeous or the prettiest man but Im just tired of hearing how ugly I am. It breaks my heart so much I can literally feel pressure on my heart just thinking about how wrong Ive been done over the course of my entire life. I guess the main reason I typed this all out is really to ask, how do I keep going even though Im completely alone? How do I keep living knowing that Im all Ive ever had and nobody is there for me? How do I find the motivation to keep being a kind person when all Ive been shown is repulsion for just trying to be myself. How can I find a friend or girlfriend that cares about my opinions and point of view on life without making me feel ugly and worthless. How do I find any reason not to end my life with the gun thats in the room right next to me?",

Is that too much to ask?

This is the only place I can vent without annoying my loved ones. All of my friends are sick of me, its gotten to the point where even my depressed friend thinks Im too much and no longer wants to talk to me. I can barely control any of my emotions anymore, its like Im watching my life instead of living it. I laugh at horrible tragic things that arent funny because of it, which has caused me a lot of backlash in the long run.

For the last few months i can say finnaly i am no longer depressed or my depression has gotten really better as there are still days when i feel extremly low but those days happen maybe onde or twice in two weeks. My social anxiety is i would say seriously lower as i could not speak to people and now i have almost no trouble approaching a stranger but keeping longer conversation is still a struggle but im working on it i just need practice. The biggest problem was GAD... I spent half of 2018 and whole 2019 in constant worry i felt like that period of my life was one constant panic attack and i seriously worked on myself made peace with some stuff from past and when last panic attack occured couple months ago i just said to myself i cant be like this no more and basicly numbed myself and life was pretty decent for last two months but as it always happens its all starting to come back and i became emotionless and detached..

Im so afraid. the plans, crying while everyone else slept, screaming in my head as I say Im ok to my therapist. if I tell the truth, Ill suffer worse consequences. Im so stupid. I want to tell.

    "Yesterday Was Rough To catch you up Ive dealt with depression, anxiety, and parasuicidal thoughts for over 30 years, since before I was 10. My wife and I are currently separated as we both deal with our individual issues with depression, anxiety, etc, as well as seek couples counseling. We have been married 8 years, together 10, and have a 2 12 year old son. ampx200B Last Friday, I was given an ultimatum at work. I am the director of advertising amp marketing for one of the largest independent automotive groups in the Southeast United States. I was told, in so many words, that I had a week to prove my worth or lose my job. Never mind that I have reduced our spending by 45 since I started, and brought in triple my salary in additional new business due to digital marketing efforts I implemented in the organization, all the while maintaining the original sales output of our business. I was given exactly zero direction as to how to prove my worth. Needless to say, the last week has only served to heighten my stress and anxiety. ampx200B Ive never been a very physically affectionate person. I get that from my mom, a survivor of sexual abuse when she was a child. But yesterday, I really needed a hug from my wife. I just wanted to hold her in my arms, breathe in her scent, and feel like everything was going to be alright. ampx200B I realize, cognitively, that this process is a good thing for our lives.

When I question my mother about her incredibly selfish and narcissistic ideals, and pushing me to be what she thinks is human perfection, she just shrugs it off by saying, all humans are selfish, and this is human tendency, and hence my selfishness is justified. I dont know where to go, or what to do, and the worst part is, in the country where I live, youre legally an adult if youre 18, but youre not really an adult, for you dont get a job without graduating, and you definitely dont get affordable houses on rent with the meagre income youd earn as a pink collared employee.

    "Is this sexual assault? So when I was five, a group of guys who were inside my school they all looked around 17 to me circled me and one guy asked if my name was Thomas, he said his name was also Thomas there was no way that they could have known my name, I had no friends and had never seen these guys before, and they honestly looked to old to go to my school well they then asked have you every touched yourself? I said no and then one of the guys shoved his hands down his pants and started to jack off, they told me to try it to and I did. The same guy who knew my name asked if he wanted him to do it for me. I said no. My memory gets a little blurry but I remember the guys moving a bit closer to me there. I dont know what happened next because my memory is completely gone. But I do remember that I told my parents small details of it and the next day at school about five or so adults came with me I cant remember if any of them were police and they got some students out of class and asked if any of them did it. they were all in the last year of that school, and none of them looked even half the age of the guys who did it so the people who did it were never caught. Shortly after this incident, I suffered from extreme suicidal ideation, and a many times I even told my parents I was going to kill myself. I have also suffered from separation anxiety all my life since. I am 16M now and only remembered this about a year ago. I am wondering if this is sexual assault. Or is it more, or less?

This person then told me since we are talking more frequently, I figured Id let you know I suffer severe depression and anxiety.

Just know Im always around if you wanna ear to listen to  So its been two months now and I know some of yall would think why are you so invested, go live your life which I have been doing.

Ive tried to see if I could do what my friends told me and its to try and meet other people. But none of them clicked like how it clicked with the person Im talking to. They tell me she probably leading you on and I would simply say,  well why would they send 8 min audios about what were talking about?

    "How to get brave enough to kill yourself PLEASE NOTE I am not in any danger to myself at this time so no need for urgency. TLDR self hate, worthlessness, getting over fear of death. Im just so tired of living. Ive always hated myself and people since a very early age and I cannot trust anyone. I feel absolutely wrong in this world. Everything I do or say or think is wrong. Since day one I was wrong. I cant do anything right like honestly not trying to exaggerate here and cant make any connections with anyone. Im actually unable to feel love or compassion or any sort of human connection. Dont even get me started on sex Im sick of watching everyone else get what I cant have. I dont deserve love or kindness and Im honestly sick of being the brunt of a very boring joke. I feel like the universe is constantly telling me I dont belong here I also feel like Im not THAT important to have the universe specifically pick on me. My role in this world is to be unremarkable and useless. I only see evil in the world, I can see no kindness. As long as there is man men, there can be on peace. Since the dawn of time weve chosen violence, death and hate. Even in the 21st century we still are starting wars, having genocides and famine and humans are becoming less and less human or more human?? I cant hold onto friendships or make any solid connections. I can only make friend with people who need someones shoulder to cry on and once theyre done with me, theyre gone. I also cling onto anyone that stays remotely too long and then feel utterly betrayed by the smallest problem they face me with. I freak out at the smallest things like dropping a spoon or having a giant mess. I used to be able to pretend to be happy and healthy and human but, as usual, I cant do that right so Im slipping. I cant stay at a job for longer than a year without freaking out. I work at a job Ive wanted for so long but see how little work or care is actually put in by my fellow coworkers and its maddening.",
    "Always late for work Ive been consistently late for work by about 15 minutes the past couple of weeks. My boss has noticed and asked if Im happy in my current position. I told him I was fine and would do better to be on time. Every morning is a struggle to get out of bed. Every morning is a challenge, and by running late it snowballs into a stressful and triggering day. All I want to do is stay in bed and sleep. How do you force yourself to get out of bed? How do you deal with tardiness?",
    "Severe anxiety and depression Most of my life I have suffered with depression, anxiety, self deprecating thoughts and worse case scenario imagery in my head almost nonstop. Its like a movie that never stops playing. I currently take 120 mg daily of CBD spread throughout to help manage my symptoms. Is there any hope for me to be alright without taking so much medication. To put it in imagery, It really feels like its a python constantly wrapped around my neck and When I take medication, I feel it let go for a while but can also still feel it just sitting there in the corner waiting for it it wear off so it can pounce right back on and keep strangling me. I need a long term solution. it has gotten so bad that I cant stop taking the CBD for more than a day without experiencing severe mental distress. Sometimes I cannot even function without it. When I took CBD for the first time it was also the first time I had ever felt normal. I am grateful to have this medication but at the same time I do not want to have to depend on this for the rest of my life. I just want the normal brain chemistry that other people seem to take for granted. Having a normal day for me is so rare its like finding buried treasure for me. And then I want to stay normal so bad and hold on to that good feeling that ironically, I bring the anxiety back about trying to stay feeling normal. It almost feels hopeless. Is there any hope that I can ever have a normally functioning mind without taking large amounts of medication? At this point my liver just has to take the hit because for my mind to feel the way it does without it I cant keep going like that.",
    "Why can’t I open up to anyone about the things that unsettle me? I am hoping that someone here can help me with this. I have been sexually assaultedI think that thats the proper term without get into detail by my classmates when I was in sixth grade. I have been so ashamed that I didnt tell anyone about this to this day. And I am still not able to work up enough courage to tell anyone my story. I have been writing with this lady from my countries crisis hotline for about two week and I have told her already some things about myself, but they are all rather superficial. I cant see myself opening up to anyone beyond that very small surface level. When I imagine getting a therapist and talking to them I think that I could tell them maybe a little bit more if they were facing me with their back. Its all just so weird. It probably makes no sense to you, I dont understand it either... Someone I wish that I could talk about everything but there is just a barrier in my head making it hard to even type about stuff. I am probably going to lose my mind one day without having anyone know why.",

    "The Story of This Year Im a 22yo male and Ive been struggling with depression and anxiety since before I can even remember. I was put into the foster care system in Australia when I was 3 and stayed there till I was 18. Thankfully I didnt cycle a lot like most kids and I found a foster family who I now call my real family. Im having a really difficult time at the moment, this year had been really really tough. Im in my 4th year of uni and Ive failed the last 2 years because of my mental state, Ive been seeing counsellors and doctors and Im on medication. 2 weeks ago I got diagnosed with Bipolar II and now been medicated for that. But I just need to vent so Im going to talk about my year and hows its been the worst and best year Ive had in a very long time. So the best year started on the 31st of December 2018. I was at college by myself over Christmas and in news years eve I wanted to spend it with someone because I couldnt with my foster family. I invited 2 friends that were in my town at the time who came over. We sat and chatted for an hour and they started to get bored, my mate asked if he could invite a friend over to join us, I agreed. This friend ended up bringing a fair few people, I would say around 10. Me being anxious as all shit over everything in life, freaked out and stayed silent. I ended up having a few drinks and with each one became more confident and less anxious. Turns out these people were pretty amazing, I made a friend who was 7ft tall and he was honestly the big friendly giant. I made another friend who Ill call Max, we hit it off straight away and Ive never connected so well with someone. We instantly became best friends, he stayed over my place for an entire month until we decided to move out with 2 of our other friends, one of those who was homeless and was desperately trying to find someone to live. A little back story before we get rocky, I lived at a university where at the time our flat 8 bedroom house sorta thing was located on campus. All 8 people were and still are my closest friends. They are a very important part of my life and they mean the world to me.",

    "I want to learn to appreciate the positive gay inclusion and acceptance, and stop letting homophobia and gay exclusion and alienation burden me I am a feminine gay guy. So, not only am I guy, but I like being feminine too in my appearance and behavior. And especially online, I keep on and on and on coming across SO many people against homosexuality, andor people against men being allowed to be feminine. ampx200B And what I have been using since I was a kid to try to help make me feel better is feelgood escapism in the forms of movies and shows. But as an adult, I cant even use that, since the type of movies and shows Im interested in keeps excluding homosexuals and feminine guys. And even when they dont, the representation is poorly handled. ampx200B I love fantasy, I love science fiction, I love superhero stuff, I love animated stuff. Literally only example of a feminine male character Ive seen depicted in a good proper way is in the Youtubeexclusive animated show Hazbin Hotel. And, when it comes to a homosexual male romance where you get to see the two males fall in love, share their first kiss, become a couple, and stay a couple without either one of them dying at any point? To my knowledge, it doesnt exist within these genres. ampx200B But I try very hard to stay positive, and appreciate what I DO have as opposed to what I dont. I got that Hazbin Hotel character Angel Dust. And I got an openly gay male character in the ParaNorman movie, and in Avengers Endgame. So, good step in the right direction I suppose. ampx200B And furthermore, people ARE getting more gaysupportive, and more people are encouraging gay inclusion. So rationally, I should know better. But I keep feeling so sad and depressed and tired of life, feeling like there is no escapism properly working for me whenever I feel down. And I just dont know how to deal with it.",
    "I hate my body and my thoughts Ever since I was little I was always struggling with my physical appearance. I have been told throughout my life that I was overweight and that just screwed over my image even more. Here I am feeling guilty cause I had a bit of grill chicken and honestly Im just tired. Im tired of thinking of exercise as a mere chore. Im tired that I cant enjoy food anymore, and the fact that my mom cooks so much doesnt help. My family all says Im lean and normal but I feel so disfigured. My shoulders are too broad and my arms are flappy making me look twice my size, my thighs are gigantic and are covered with cellulite. I really hate my mirrors and if I could break them I would. My weight is always in the middle of normal or overweight and one slice of cake could tip it off.

    "I Don't Want to Talk About It I am depressed. I live a joyless life. I dont want to kill myself but I dont really see the point in living. I keep seeing ads or public service announcements with celebrities that say Do you want to talk about it? Find someone to talk to. Im here for you to talk to. My problem is that I dont want to talk about it. I am ashamed. I feel weak and incapable of solving my own problems. I feel like my life is objectively great with no real reason to feel this way. I dont want to whine, I dont want to dwell. But I do recognize that talking about it has to happen if anything is going to get better. The people close to me clearly see theres a problem and inquire. My default response is I dont want to talk about it. Or I ignore the question. Or I change the subject. How do I get over this hurdle of being able to talk about this with anyone?",

    "Can depression cause a bad memory? When I was a young teenager I was diagnosed with depression and an anxiety disorder. My entire teenage years were dedicated to getting better and school  friends were not my priority. I still had friends, but I didnt see them as much as most people see their friends. I went to a clinic to treat my suicidal thoughts and anxiety, so I missed out on a year of school. I finally got better when I was 18, but now I am in my twenties and Im realising that I barely have any memories from that time. I do have some clear memories, but most are related to my depression, but I can almost never remember any fun stories my friends bring up, that I was apparently involved in. Its 67 years of a weird blur. I keep seeing people posting pictures of themselves as teenagers, and talking about how crazy that time was and how much fun they had in high school. Their first job, their first boyfriend, their first drink. I am glad I got to the point where I am doing a lot better. But I do feel like a I missed out on a huge part of childhood, and dont have great social skills because of it.

I have cheated by getting happy endings and watching porn. I feel horrible about this. 6. I am unemployed. I cant keep a job. No one will hire me. I am an older worker and dont know what to do. 7. I want to get out of the marriage but dont know how. I cant support myself. ITS OKAY TO BE DEPRESSED RIGHT? I CANT THINK STRAIGHT..... I LITERALLY cant think straight. I cant focus on getting things done.",

Im lonely, I dont know what to do career wise, Im tired. So fucking tired. So I open up my laptop, and watch a movie, or series. And I feel even worse, cause Id prefer their reality to mine. And Im nothing like I wish I was,and I feel so often pretty much worthless because Im not accomplished. And I wish I had some kind of purpose because it all feels so fucking aimless. Im just tired.",

    "I just don't care badly enough unless I'm in a crisis. Nothing is really interesting or exciting. How do I care enough ? I cant get myself to work on my resume. I cant get myself to apply to jobs. I cant get myself to look for a new doctor. I cant get myself to read a book. Im not even interested in planning a trip. Its all just whatever to me. I only do things if I HAVE to or if Im inspired by a strong emotion. Like if Im angry, Ill do something. But that wont last long. I used to be ambitious. I used to care a lot more. I used to have some sense of passion. Now  I see just how powerless Ive always been and how overall meaningless it is to care so god damn much. I understand I need to be providing others with something of value to get value in return. I understand that the more value I can give, the more value I get. Its just that whatever value I can get in return just doesnt really appeal to me. None of it is incredibly interesting or exciting. And even what I would classify as the most exciting  its not like I can accomplish it. I cant attract the type of life companion that I want because I wouldnt even date myself. I dont have the type of money as Bezos does to see Earth from space and its extremely unlikely I ever will be able to attain it, let alone attaining it ethically without harming others and by paying my fair share of taxes.

I was texting and later was in call with my fiancé while that was happening and he was still upset but was telling me that it was not fault.

    "I feel lost and disappointed in myself Im 23F I went to a 4year after high school, for 2 and a half years, struggled to find friends and did terribly in school but I stayed nonetheless??? I regret that so much because I spent most of my time sick because I had no one to take care of me. I continued going there for 2 and a half years? When J was almost miserable thinking it would get better.. i had a close friend there who eventually didnt want to be my friend anymore and I felt so alone away from my family. No one cared about me, why did I stay? Eventually I left of course, but why did I continue to go there for 2.5 years when I wasnt performing well and didnt fit in with people at all? Is this the same reason people stay in abusive relationships? Now, 23 years later, after working and going to community college, Im transferring this fall. I thought I would be able to get a second chance at college but this pandemic happens and my classes are online. I still feel so much abandonment after my friend left me in college. I felt like I put so much into them, and they left me. I feel like Im disappointing my family because they had high hopes for me, but I still havent proved myself to them.

I self harmed for a while, but my best friend talked me out of it. Its been hard to live like this. Having nothing, going nowhere, no idea what I want.

The title basically summed it up Ive been dealing with depression for around a year till now and it just gets worse with time please dont suggest things like fight it dont give up theres nothing to fight or to give up on. Depression affects everyone differently and My depression Isnt the type where I have negative thinking or suicidal that I can get over with therapy my depression is basically severe anhedonia and fatigue Nothing absolutely nothing I can enjoy foods doesnt taste good girls dont make me feel horny orgasms are numb dog doesnt make me feel happy friendship and exercise doesnt help me a bit. So theres nothing to fight its just that the reward centers in my brain for some reason decided to turn off and no matter what I do I cant get them to turn back on again. And please please dont suggest working on the root cause Im not depressed because I dropped my ice cream or because the teacher yelled at me Im depressed because I have fcked up genetics and Im trying to cure it. I fking tried everything I tried therapy I tried Cognitive Behavioral Therapy I tried every antidepressant SSRI SNRI Tricyclic Wellbutrin Mirtazapine Atypical antipsychotics they helped minor symptoms like concentrationfatigueinsomnia but did absolutely nothing for my anhedonia.

    "My mother and I had an unsettling conversation in the midst of my depression, and I don't know how to feel... Okay, so I am teen 14M who is dealing with a lot of struggles. I have had depression for months, and I dont know what to do. I live in a smal part of a big town, which means I dont see many friends often, and Im the only one my age in that part of town. Thats bad from a start, but thats not whats triggering me... I had been dealing with my dumbass psycho ex, not able to see my gf, being bullied and cyberbullied. I have beaten myself until I bled, every day in the past 2 weeks, and I always wonder if life is worth living, and yet I still try to piece things together again. Yesterday, I had figured out that my past was a lot worse than I had originally thought, with reoccurring memories of childhood trauma. We were having a normal conversation about how I was doing at school as usual, but it took a turn quickly back to the worst childhood memories I had, which all I had forgotten until then. I had thought it was always peaceful back then since almost every childhood memory I had before then was happy. I even bring up these positive memories whenever Im down. And these memories came back. Heres what they were one by one in the order they happened The first memory, the only one I couldnt regain my perception on was one from when I was in preschool obviously. The last day I went to preschool, my mother was watching in the preschool because she noticed things werent perfectly fine there. Before it was over, a little girl who was 3 years of age, opened one of the metal doors and accidentally slammed her fingers in the doors. The tips of 3 of that girls fingers were cut off from that door and was bleeding everywhere. The staff was panicking, but they werent doing anything. They didnt call for help. They just stood and watched. The staff, also, were both 17 yearolds watching over 32 preschool kids which was illegal. My mother quickly took me out of that daycare and felt so bad for leaving me there.",
    "Anyone here have reverse seasonal affective disorder - i.e.: summer depression? If so, could use some advice It took me months to recover Bc I couldnt find any type of add on medication that I could tolerate that helped. During these spells I literally feel as if Im drugged  I am searching for words, I have no energy. I feel as if Im literally impaired or like I have taken a sedative. I understand it must sound dramatic, but Ive not been able to find anything medication wise that is able to help. I had a gene site test and Ive tried the meds listed in my green bucket and the side effects were so intense I couldnt continue on them, not to mention theyre not covered by our insurance so we paid over 1500.00 last summer on meds that didnt work. I find it difficult to find other people who have this and especially difficult to convey to my prescribing Dr. what Im going through. Additionally, I dont understand why it just happened so recently and without much warning like cause and effect. I have had depression most of my adult life and have been able to manage it with medication and lifestyle changes, but this summer thing is a different animal. Now its June and Im hoping that I can do some prevention as I feel like Ive exhausted meds. options. I have an appointment with my provider this week and I need to be as pro active as I can now in case I have this experience again. I just dont know what to ask for at this point, nor what to even do  or if I even have to do anything. Maybe it wont happen  I mean anything is possible, but I feel like I need to at least try to be prepared. Anyone have experience with this and any tips? I am thinking of preparing myself for a ketamine infusion or something this year. I just cannot imagine going through it again Bc it lasted so long this past summer well into the fall and I got to the point of being so low it was scary. A Dr I see occasionally suggested planning a vacation during the time when I usually feel this come on  sounds good, but also  could be a train wreck. Anyway  anything would be helpful.

    "I can’t go more than 5 minutes without crying These last few weeks have been the hardest in my life. After covid cleared out college campuses and my partner and I were forced to go back home my boyfriends family told him since he was back living under their roof he would have to follow every one of their demands. In the town where we go to college we were seeing each other multiple times a week. And the week before we were booted we spent every hour together. As soon as we got home his family told him he could no longer see me. I understand we are in a pandemic but we had been swapping spit even that same day they told him to quarantine. If he had anything I definitely had it and vice versa. I agreed to two weeks not seeing each other, not knowing how hard it would be. Even after that ended they didnt want us to see each other because during that time my state issued a stay at home order. I have not been able to see friends obviously and my family is abusive and toxic there isnt a single day in the house that there arent screaming matches. I lost my motivation to do any of my classes that went online. I stopped eating, I started drinking, and taking pills in incrementing amounts hoping I would gather the courage to kill myself. I started cutting myself so I could distract myself from the emotional pain. All I do is lie in bed, and get water once a day. I cry so often starting as soon as I wake up, and even more so at night. I havent been able to sleep well, sometimes at all. I only fear this situation is going to get worse and it feels like there will be no end. It was a shock to come from months of being with my person so happy to have it all stripped away so suddenly. If anyone has any tips that would help me, Id appreciate it.",

    "Gf won't get help because she doesn't want to change Im at a complete loss here. I 27f suffer from depression and anxiety myself. Im having trouble reaching out for help, but Im slowly building the courage and doing self help because I want to get better and be a happy person. Last night my girlfriend 28f who has been struggling for a while told me that shes in a really dark place. When I started to lead the discussion into getting help or even just a little self help, she just gave me a flat out no. Shes been suffering for years and the various meds and therapy she goes through just help her for a little while and then she goes back to depression. She says she doesnt want to be different. She doesnt want to work on being happy because then she isnt herself. Doesnt like the feel of being on meds because she isnt herself. Shes fine just accepting being depressed as her default state and one day when shes tired of living shell end it all. She doesnt want to end it now so shes not eligible to be hospitalised. But she is calm and completely certain that eventually she will kill herself. I dont know what to do with such clear and calm certainty. She struggles with similar things that I do. I try to give the answers that hope are true. whats the point of living when all we do is work and sleep to pay for a place we never use because were working or sleeping Im not worth saving nobody cares etc, but she just refutes it and stays where she is. Problem is, I leave the country in the next 6 months so weve always known our relationship has an expiry date and she has no support network. She has no family and very few friends that are in a position to help out. Shes spent quite a lot of time homeless in the past. I dont know what to do. It feels like she only wants to get better if it happens organically, but that is a rarity. TLDR gf wont get help.",
    "I could use some help ;D Its not what you know. But who you know. Been ghosted after my 3rd interview. What makes it worse, is knowing who was hired the industry is very connected online. Said other person had less experience and a worse degree than I. I must really suck at interviews or lack enthusiasm. All feedback I get is, you were great, but we went with someone else or you lacked enthusiasm when I smiled and did my best to be interested during the entire interview. The gaming industry is very altrustic. Ive been stuck as a permatemp for a 1 year 7 months. I have a first degree and a lot of experience. Employers still dont see my value and I dont know what else to do. Ive turned to alchohol to numb the pain, and its gotten to the point I dont care if im fired and lose my job. Im greatful for the opportunity, but im stuck, not learning anything new and I have been rejected from multiple opportunities at the company im currently at. I constantly aim yo better myself by asking for more experience, but im ignored. Then why am I kept and renewed contracts? Make it make sense. At this point, from my already nonexistent selfesteem, ive concluded im unlikable, too honest and its not what I know, but who I dont know. Alchohol is literally my best friend.

    "depressed piece of shit I am a young adult who lives in New York I grew up with fully supporting parents and friends, but that means nothing when your mental health is not stable. The last year of my life I have been battling with severe depression and anxiety, and was just recently hospitalized for a week in a psychiatric ward. At this point, I feel so incurable nothing has helped. I have seen my therapist for a year, seemed professional medical help, took the numerous amount of pills and have not felt the slightest bit better. Things have gotten worse than before. I have laundry piling up in the corner of my room and at this point I just pull out any clean clothes I can find in my dresser. Showers? HA even a short 5 minute shower seems to take too much energy at this point. AND I AM SO SICK AND TIRED OF HEARING THE SAME BULLSHIT LINES OF It will get better, and You have nothing to be depressed about, or Everything will be fine because it always works out. To be honest, my depression has just spiraled out of control at this point. I cant look at myself in the mirror and hate everything about myself internally, externally and mentally. I hate myself and the people I am hurting. I could have a good day, but at the end of the day my suicidal thoughts still sit in the back of my head. Sometimes I sit and regret not just doing it blade to my wrist and a family member walks in. I had the blade in my right hand, resting on my left forearm and I regret not ending my life there when I had the motherfucken chance.",
    "Being the boyfriend. My Girlfriend and I have been dating for almost 6 years. She has suicidal thoughts occasionally. She tells me I am very supportive and a great bf but sometimes I dont think Im giving the best support. Sorry for the long post. I dont know if theres any other SOs in this thread or if there is another sub I should be posting in I dont have anyone I can talk to about this. After about a year into dating, while we were cleaning dishes in her apartment, she let on how serious her depression was when she told me that she had once held a gun to her head. After a long silence we both cried and I told her how much I loved her. She told me that she had only ever told her best friend and didnt want anyone to know, so Ive never told anyone, not even my closest friend of 15 years whom I share anything and everything with. So thank you to whomever shares any words of wisdom youre all I got. Over the the last year our relationship has dwindled, we still tell each other we love each other constantly and talk about getting engagedmarried. But we dont have conversations like we used to, she always falls asleep on the couch so we dont sleep together hardly, we dont have sex at all, I think 6 times total last year, that has been a big point of frustration at least for me  Ive tried to initiate sex and been shot down so many times that Ive all but given up at this point, even when its your lover, your best friend, it still feels like crap when you get rejected. Ive tried to talk to her about it many times the day after or some time that is away from sex so we can have a calm conversation about it but everyone so far, every time we have talked shes gotten worked up and basically says she doesnt feel like it. We both have HPV so sometimes that gets in the way but whenever weve talked its always that shes not in the mood. I feel like shes not telling me something. I feel as if weve stopped growing and are maybe even starting to resent each other, which is scary to me.",
    "I’m not sure if I have depression, please reply, I made posts to other subreddits and no one answered and it’s making me feel even worse Then in high school I finally made friends. During 10th grade my friend told me that my crush of 6 years called me super ugly and said who would want to date her? That shattered everything. And now I believe that Im so repulsive that I will never find love and I will be lonely forever. Fortunately, I made friends, and one cool thing I do with a group Im really close with is that we have therapy sessions and we talk about our problems and try to cheer each other up. Ive yet to have my session yet, but I accidentally gave away that I hate my body and they think I have body dysmorphia, I think I have it too but I cant say cause I havent been diagnosed. Honestly it made me feel so good that there were people who were concerned about me but that never happened again. They never speak about it like they speak about other friends problems... Thats probably because I havent told them all this, and I wouldve but Im afraid. What if all of this is me being too dramatic. And that what Im feeling isnt serious and they think bad of me. And Im scared to go to a therapist because of that same reason. So I rather keep all these emotions inside, and almost every night I cry because of these problems. Most of the times at night, I feel empty, lifeless. If I close my eyes I imagine Im floating through space lifeless. My thoughts are very dangerous because I keep thinking more negative, and to avoid that I go on my phone and distract myself by doing something. Because of my disease I have to take pills daily, and Ive always thought that I have an easy chance to kill myself by taking a lot of them, but I dont think I would because its a sin in my religion, but maybe one day Im too down that I might do something... Can someone please tell me if this is depression or not, because I really want to overcome it. Please reply to this, Ive made many posts on other subreddits regarding this and no one has answered, which makes me feel like no one truly cares. Thank you.",
    "New illness diagnosis is ruining my life I have a lot of deadlines coming up this week which have made me anxious every day for almost 2 weeks now. The anxiety has made my physical illness flair up to the point where I have to miss school, I cant eat, sleep, or be productive. Im so so sad because of this. It happened all at once and I dont know how to manage it. Ive been crying almost every day because I miss when I felt better. The physical illness is new diagnosed in March and its extremely overwhelming. It makes me feel hopeless every day. Some people get better and some people get worse. Idk if I believe I can get better, but I want to. Its just so hard for me to envision living the rest of my life suffering like this. My therapist who Ive been seeing for 2 years is now taking 6 months off. Ive tried to find a new therapist but they either arent taking new patients or dont even respond to my phone calls. Im so lost. I dont know what to do.",

She has major chronic depression and on hee meds, but her parents were never supportive and doesnt believe in mental health, nor her conditions in general. Believing that shes just wasting her life. Her father wants to kick him out of house asap bec she came out as trans mtf, and couldnt really accept her sexuality, plus she dropped out school, and quit work this sem because everything was heavy for her and she doesnt have any energy to do something, even small things.

    "Does it ever really get any better? Ive been dealing with depression for a long time, several years. I only recently started trying to fix it and started taking some meds which Ive been on for about 3.5 months now. Whats the point of it all? I come home from work now and for no reason just feel totally useless and like I dont matter. At least before the meds I was numb and didnt feel this way. Im finding myself almost in tears at work, for no reason at all. Earlier this week I came home, sat down on my couch and just started to cry. All week Ive had 0 motivation to do anything. I still ended up going to the gym for a couple yoga classes hoping it would at least make me feel a bit better, it didnt. I just want to know if this will ever get better? Will I ever feel usefulwanted? Will I ever genuinely be happy? Im so tired of being tired and sad.",
    "How do I (14 M) talk to my (Typical Indian) dad about seeing a therapist? Now I dont know if I should believe him or not. Anyways, this was just the backstory and here is whats going on now I want to see a therapist to talk about my problems but there is no therapist where I live. The closest one is like 3 hours away. One of my closest friends lives in Chandigarh Its a big city and I asked him if he could find out about any therapists there. His mom used to be a dentist so she knew some people and one of her close friends is a reputable psychologist in Fortis hospital. He told me about her and I was like Well, so can I call her and talk to her about wtf is going on with me but turns out she needs to talk to my dad first because since Im a minor I cant be diagnosed without parental consent. So this means that I will have to tell my dad that I need to see a therapist. He will ask me why and I will have to tell him about my depression, suicidal thoughts, etc. Keeping in mind how our last convo about my mental health went and our notsogood relationship, can you guys give me some advice about how to talk to him? PS He gets irritated very easily and he rarely listens to me, and even if he does he will say Im wrong since I am younger and that I never listen to him. TLDR I am a 14 yo Indian dude with a typical Indian dad. Our last convo about my mental health went not so wonderful and he told me to kill myself and how to do it, and that he doesnt give a fuck about it. I want to see a therapist for depression, suicidal thoughts, selfharming, etc. but the closest one is 3 hours away. I need parental consent for even basic diagnoses, and I have no idea how to approach my dad about this. We have a poor relationship and havent talked about anything else than studies in the past 3 years or so. Skim through the upper paragraphs because I might have left something out, I tend to do that",

    "My friends left me, whats wrong with me and how do I fix it? After about 6 months I got fed up with this so I wrote him a essay on how ghosting and making only rude comments isnt nice and that I was sort of hurt that he was doing this. He then responded, Oi calm down. Too where I got more mad calling him out for the crap hes been doing, only to get the response, Cringe. We eventually got into a call around the same time, too where he said that he didnt care about me and he ghosted me because he felt like it. A few months later, some of my friends wanted to inv him to a discord server, I was a little not that into it, but I felt that maybe he would be more mature and would be my friend again or smth dumb like that. After my friends had messaged him, he messaged me, Cringe. I asked him, Dude what the hell. Too where he said, Yknw its been a few months, I used too think that you were just a joke or a little game, but now your weird and kinda cringe. Then blocking me. This all happend in about the same time in august 2020. I mean I dont know if Im being silly but it really really hurt me, and I dont wanna be on some kid on r Im14andthisisdeep.

She wanted to stay a virgin till marriage and we same the same religious values, which I loved and respected so much which I think is part of the reason its so hard on me.

Im just in a rough spot and somedays I just want to end it.

    "How in the actual heck does one love themselves I have a very bad problem in that the only way to love myself is that I receive love from other people a potential girlfriend. This is apparently very unhealthy and self destructive. Problem is, that is all I know about how to love myself. I have been told to love myself but I find that VERY difficult to do. I was raised in a household with a mother who was infuriated and enraged with seemingly small things and took things way too far pretty frequently. She took a lot of her anger out on my father and she did so in plain sight of me and my sister. Her use of pure hatred and rage towards my father rubbed off onto me. The difference is, that unlike her, I have the common decency to keep all this inside my head. A lot is directed towards the outer world and a lot is directed towards myself. I cant love myself, because the only two things I feel for myself are hatred and rage, so I look to unspoiled minds for affection. I know this is self destructive and it will just push me closer to pulling the trigger or jumping off the cliff, I know that. ampx200B I am looking for real, tangible, practical and usable advice for how to love oneself.

Thats what I deserve because Im a bad person and a bad person deserves punishments!!!! !",
    "Overcoming depression Can you ever recover from depression? I would so appreciate if anyone who has recovered from depression could please tell us their story as a way of providing a bit of hope and strength for us seemingly eternal sufferers out here. It would be helpful to know briefly how you got help, what worked vs what didnt and perhaps why you think it worked. Clearly doctors dont seem to know anything so maybe we can help each other!",

    "Could someone tell me a little something good? Im having the worst day Ive had in a while, feeling really helpless in a job I dont hate but drains me emotionally until I burn out Anyway you guys probably dont want my whole life story, but Im feeling super rough.

Im not a danger to myself so no worries there, I just really need something to hold onto for a bit?",
    "I’m sick of everything, my life is just meant to be miserable. Its a long post, but I will appreciate any feedback from anyone who decides to read it! My struggle with depression started around 20172018. Im currently 18yo. Sometimes Im more stable than the other day, there are the times that Im capable of controlling how I response to big waves of emotions. But its never totally gone, it likes to come back and my behavior is often caused by some unhealed memories or habits from my lowest times. I get embarrassed when I get emotionally involved into a conversation, I hate the thought of making my mental health an excuse, but sometimes I just feel like I just ran a marathon, I lay down and I cant help but cry because of such a failure my life is and how weak I am. I have an abusive father, my family and I tried everything to solve problems and help him change but he wont listen to anyone. Our family is pretty much divided to responsible men my oldest brother and my father and women that should do everything around the house so everyone else, especially my father, can live comfortably. I have five siblings. Since Im the oldest girl Im expected to be the major housekeeper except my mom. Im also the one with the most sense of being fair and respectful towards what I have and whats given to me, thats why I rarely skip my responsibilities or deny any request or help. I feel overwhelmed about the amount of stuff I need to do, not to mention the way my parents treat me when something is not done perfectly. I graduated high school with average results, Im neither the smartest nor the dumbest person on earth. I dont have any specific abilities nor passions to pick a solid university major that would make me happy and open a career path that would let me sustain myself. Now that I can apply to college, my score is slightly beyond the minimum. I picked a major about Korea, the country and the language, its something I got interested in, I am studying Korean for a while. But when I realized how much points you have to have to get accepted I lost any excitement that I had, I barely meet the requirements, most people have tens of points more. I dont stand out in any way. I was never liked at school.",

    "Help Changing for the Better Ive suffered silently with depression and anxiety for most of my life, usually covering it up with relationships or alcohol. Long story short, my depression and anxiety stems largely from childhood and teenage bullying and growing up in a home with very unhappy parents who werent meant to be parents. It wasnt until recently, on the verge of divorce, that Ive moved past the stigma of depression and admitted that I suffer from it. Ive been taking high doses of CBD and ltheanine daily Ive seen the unintended, scary side effects of prescribed antidepressents too often in former friends, in addition to daily meditation, getting outdoors daily for at least 30 mins, daily exercise and changing to a healthier, mediterranean diet. All of this had helped tremendously, but I still have occasional bad days like today where its a struggle to start my day. Due to my ongoing depression and anxiety, I havent used my brain the way it is supposed to be used, and as a result, I am very slow at thinking and making decisions in the heat of the moment. This has caused nothing but pain for me in romantic relationships and with roommates. I feel so incredibly stupid. I desperately need to change, and I have been trying, but it hasnt been easy. Every time I say this week is going to be different, it isnt. I get into constant arguments with my roommate because of my slow thinking and ingrained selfishness. I am reaching out for advice from anyone who has been where Ive been and made it through. How did you finally change for the better? Im at my wits end. I really want to change, I really do. My roommate says I cant because I just dont care enough. But I do care. I just cant figure out for once and for all how to improve myself 10x more e.g., my memory, my intelligence, my selfishness, being more aware of my surroundings, and most importantly, truly living life. Thank you very much for any advice anyone can give.",
    "I think I have genuine depression. I was hit by a drunk driver in November. I got some bruises, shock, and my car was deemed total loss, but it still works just fine thankfully. Since my accident, I went for a run in a violent snowstorm in St. Louis, slipped and fell on my back and hit the back of my head on the ground. It hurt a bit but I continued running. The knots on my head healed up eventually. Ive seen like 5 different accident scenes around the areas since my accident back on 1122. These past like 5 days, Ive felt incredibly emotionally unsettled. Im not in control of my emotions, and I feel so emotional inside my head, I cant speak that well. Today I feel is the worst because Im extremely emotionally unstable, I feel out of control of my emotions, and just powerfully depressed. Ive noticed Ive been waking up around 6630AM or so every morning even though I want to sleep more and refresh my mind, brain chemistry. Im going to Finland in a week or so, for a week or so. People have been cold and rude to me in public recently as well, as well as over the phone unfortunately. Ive been trying to keep marching on, but I dont feel interested, lively, confident, and vibrant like I usually do. Do you think this is depression genuinely or something else medically? Tell me your thoughts and thank you for listening and for your concern and human empathy. I care about you and your feelings too. I do hope you have a wonderful happy new year for yourselves. .",
    "Staying POSITIVE is ALREADY hard and now I am the caregiver to a SUICIDAL FRIEND Hi guys, I dont know if this is the right forum for my overall mixed content. Im 23 F. And I need some advice on my situation. Appreciate it if yall could share with me your thoughts. To start off, I have both anxiety and depression. I know that with those 2, it definitely would be a roller coaster ride with my emotions and I am familiar with this as it is like a cycle that I kept having to go through. I would say that my depression is not as severe as my anxiety though. So back to my main story. Recently I have been busy trying to help a suicidal friend. I have known her for 7 years plus and am aware that she was suffering from depression. I always thought that it was going to be okay as time goes by but then I realized it worsened. She was really going all out on ending her life that I had to call the police on her. Thing is, she has been planning out her will and settling whatever she considered as necessity for the preparation of her demise. Its like i am scared but I have no choice to take charge as she does not have a good rs with her family. I managed to persuade her to go and seek help from the professional. She was adamant but somehow agreed eventually. First medication didnt work so we changed to another type. End up, she decided to stop taking the medication all by herself. She went MIA for about a week or so. When she finally texted, it was bad news  she was prepping to end her life. I had to call the police on her. Apparently she lied to them that she was okay and would be attending her appointment, so they couldnt do anything in my country the police can only intervene if you are caught in the act of committing suicide. However later on she berated me as she felt that I had betrayed her. She however continued to confide in me. I was pretty much unsure what to do so I wrote a letter to the family secretly I know where she stays and i made sure to text her mum that I had put a letter outside their house gate.",

    "TW; First Fatherless Father's Day I23m lost my dad to covid19 at the start of this year. I woke up and realized what day it is and just started sobbing. My partner25f lost her dad at a young age and has numbed herself to cope as his passing played a huge part in the path her life took, but this is still fresh for me. Its the first Fathers Day without him. I asked for some support from her and her responses were very cold. You cant let today hurt you like this. I just ignore this day, you gotta just stay off your phone. You cant cry all day about this. I get that shes had time to cope with this trauma, and her responses are partly to protect herself from her feelings about her own dad shes been dealing with for years, but fuck. I needed support, just some time to let it out and confront my feelings, and after the way she responded Im no longer sure how I feel about this woman. What would you do? I try really hard to be understanding of others feelings, and especially compassionate of my partners feelings. But I honestly dont know if I can be with someone who would invalidate my feelings like that, even with their own trauma. She came to apologize and acknowledge that she was being inconsiderate, but that hurt me so much I dont even want to look at her right now. I dont know. I love this woman, and Im incredibly patient with partners. Her responses show a fundamental lack of compassion that I cant teach, but her apology shows an understanding of her fuck up and an attempt to right it, so I dont know what to do about it. Maybe after I take some time to cool off we can talk about it and gain better understanding. For anyone else hurting today, Im so sorry, just remember our fathers are out there somewhere, having a big cookout in the sky, fighting over Grill Master and looking down pridefully at the amazing children they made.",

    "My friend has been having lots of suicidal thoughts lately. I have known him for a year now, and hes studying abroad rn and Im still study at our homeland. He has been telling me about how he wants to kill himself lately, and reply less and less to my texts, or sometimes he just straight up ignored my texts and then came back with a text about killing himself. He has never talked about dying this much throughout the whole time weve known each other. I tried to talk to him, make him feel loved and other things that I think that can help him clear his mind a bit, but I dont really know if that can help him or not because hes so far away. He used to use antidepressants but he has stopped for quite a while now and he once confessed to me that he doesnt want to visit therapist or use antidepressants again. Can any of you here help me with some advice please? He is a close friend of mine, and Id die if he decides to stop living. Thank you in advance.",

Shes opened up about being on antidepressants, very briefly, but Im glad she feels comfortable at least bringing it up. I told her how I feel, which is that she can talk to me any time, she wouldnt be annoying me, I want to help her feel good, things like that.

    "anyone else struggle with finding value in themselves because nobody else does? you feel inadequate because nobody else cares about you... I dont know why its so hard to be content with myself. Be on my own. Rely only one myself. But I need people. Do you feel like you stopped caring about yourself and stopped actively living life because it seems like nobody in the world gives a damn whether youre dead or alive? Like, nobody ever contacts you or reaches out to ask how youre doing. you spend so much time pouring into relationships, doing your best to make sure people like you and then in the end...they just forget you. You only hear from them when YOU initiate contact. I guess im just wondering if anyone else has a fear of being forgotten. I spent so much time nurturing and cultivating these relationships but ultimately...you cant keep it alive on your own. It has to be a mutual effort. And thats what kills me....being the only one that cares. Its always been this way. Being the only one that misses people. People who probably have never even had a passing thought about you. I guess im just having a hard time accepting the fact that I dont mean anything to anyone. How do you guys cope with the silence? Waking up every day with this intense emptiness that almost paralyzes you. Knowing today is another day I wont hear from anybody. Today is just like yesterday and tomorrow will be the same. Feeling forgotten, like youre just a ghost roaming around aimlessly. A ghost.",
    "A friend of mine is dealing with some major depression and she isn’t texting me back. I need some advice. I have read some articles on this and I know that she likely just does not have the energy or motivation to respond, but the thing is, I would really like to talk to her since her depression does not seem to be getting better despite therapy and medication. I really feel like I should do something to help but I cant seem too since she wont engage in conversation with me. Im not at all blaming her, I understand how she feels, I just wish I could somehow get through to her so that I can do my part as a friend to help and encourage her. Its just that I want to be there to support her before its too late She has talked often about suicidal thoughts. Im not able to visit her IRL either since we live in different countries.

    "I think i should start seeking for help but i dont know where to start Hi, im 21F and i study computer science in an univerisity in Italy English isnt my first language, so sorry for eventually errors. I am shy and introverted by nature but since the start of the global pandemic things got worse. I dont know if it can help, but i have had a difficoult childood and i think i have some trauma left i recently discovered the meaning of a people pleaser and how it perfectly describes me. I started isolating myself from all my friends, i quitted from all socials, i started losing interests in everything and i dont even know what im doing with my life. I used to love a lot of things, now looking at a wall seems interesting as reading a good book, i loved having loong talks with my colleagues and my friends, now i feel like a burden for everybody so i prefer lonyless.

I have no one to help me either because my parents get mad at me for showing and signs of distress.

My mom will start screaming at me about how me being depressed makes her stressed out and how I dont even try to make friends but I do. Shell give me suggestions on how to make friends but Ive tried literally every single one shes given me, and when I tell her that Im simply suffering from a lack of social skills shell scream about how its actually that I look like a freak and a weirdo and that no one would ever want to approach me anyway. And its not like Im a bad son, Im actually better than most teenagers because I have straight As and because I have no supportive friend group that would invite me to things I dont drink or do drugs or have sex.

    "I don't feel like a real person Ive been feeling better but I still feel like Im not a person and that I shouldnt expect the good things that happen to others to happen to me, because Im not one of them. I try and pretend really hard to be a real person but I know Im pretending. I dont get happy or excited, Im not motivated by passion or enjoyment. I dont have those feelings. Im looking to feel as distant from my hopelessness as I can, but that doesnt mean Im happy, just less hopeless. I feel like I should limit my impact on real people as much as I can, and not get in the way of them being happy. I feel like this world is created for real people and I just slipped through by accident, and as long as I dont get in the way they will tolerate me when Im with them. I feel like they can see me pretending, and they know Im not real, but they go along with it because of how pathetic I am, and they dont want to feel bad for showing me that Im not real. I know that this perspective is not reality, but thats how it feels. Ive never met another not real person, I feel very alone Im not in danger, I got past that a few months ago. I finally asked for help about 6 months ago after hiding it for 10 years. I dont really know how to talk about or think about the way I feel, and Im trying to figure that out. Im posting it hear because my next therapy session isnt for another 2 weeks and I dont really know what to do with this. I wanted to ask if anyone has felt this way and eventually not, because I dont know what its like not to feel like this. I cant imagine living like this and being happy.

I decided to just take a step back and figure it all out, where these feelings are coming from. I realized that I have something deep inside of me, but I dont know what it is. Its so much i have to keep digging. For 2 weeks Ive stayed up thinking and praying and just trying to figure it out. I didnt know I was hurt, I didnt know I was lonely, I used to Just say fuck it, fuck feelings, pro athletes make it big because they dont let their feelings get in the way. And For a while it worked. Until it didnt. I keep unpacking and unpacking. I dont know what to do. I tell myself Im going to turn my life around but every morning I fail. Im on my way to being bed ridden, its just a matter of time. Im losing motivation day by day. I dont know what to do. If I ask my parents to take me to a therapist theyll just shrug it off because they wont believe I have depression. I dont even want to have depression, and I want to believe that I dont even have it. But I dont know. I guess I just need to let it all out you know? I feel so alone. I feel lonelier in school and in class with 25 other people in the room than I do in an empty house. I feel lonelier in a crowd than I do just being alone in my bed room.

Hell, right now Im swinging back and forth between asking a bunch of internet strangers. But I feel like Im going crazy. Every time I make up my mind to go tell my mom or my sister or my brother about these things, I convince myself out of it. i tell myself that these problems arent that big of a deal, that Id only be disturbing them my sister recently had a baby, so shes spending a lot of her time taking care of him that these problems arent problems and that I just need to get off my stupid lazy ass and do my work. And then i dont ask for help. And now Im starting to think that this post is a dumb idea. This wont actually achieve anything. Im complaining to strangers about problems that arent problems.

    "Advice to an 18 y/o depressed closeted bisexual dude who mostly has anti-lgbt religious family &amp; friends and is contemplating suicide? this post got no replies in the depression subreddit so here I go Im an 18 yo dude. Im starting my first year of college this August. Ive been thinking about coming out as bi to a few friends that I care about and ones I hold dear, but Im afraid of what might happen if I do it. Were all Christians my familys Catholic. I know a lot of people I care about wont approve of me whenif I come out. I project myself as this straight guy whos just an allysupporter for LGBTQ rights. Ive fought with some religious friends as I defended the topic of samesex civil unions online amp offline. Its been about 10 months since I last went to a Sunday church service where I used to talk to some friends who go to church there. I still go to my neighborhood Catholic church because of my dad who put me in the choir along with my brother. My dads also the president of our Catholic church choir. Hes also VERY outspoken about being antiLGBTQ. I find it hard to come out to my family because were super religious Catholics. There was a time when my Born Again Christian cousin female came out, they recommended her to go to conversion therapy. I was one of the few family members who know this along with my older other cousin and some of my unclesaunts. I wont be coming out to my family. Maybe not yet. Or maybe not ever, considering the factors Ive just mentioned. My dad and I would probably fight if my family finds out. Its ironic that its hard to be open to your own family whom you share the same house with. Still havent catch up with a friendchurch leader from churchschool. I feel bad for ghostingavoiding friends from this church I used to go to Born Again Christian. The last time I went to that church was July 2018.

    "What can I do to stop being a weirdo? A lot of people have called me a weirdo and I know why. I laugh really loudly its super obnoxious and I think I do it because Im an attention seeker and it make it seem like what my friend and I are talking about a lot funnier that it actually is because I want people to think Im funny. I also laugh at jokes even if theyre not funny because its less awkward than sitting there in silence and not knowing what to say I constantly do weird shit like talk really loudly or in different accents again, it might be because I want people to think Im funny I dont think before I speak. I start a sentence and then I stop because then I realise I shouldnt say something. Its like my brains delayed. I begin to say something and then I tell them to ignore me I think my brains on autopilot all the time and I dont think I constantly stare at people and make eye contact with them which is just weird, its also creepy Sometimes when I speak super fast, I end up speaking gibberish and no one knows what Im saying again, it might be because I dont think before I speak I make weird, sharp movements because Im thinking out loud and I forget that Im not alone I make weird sounds in general I dont know if its because Im so bored and I need to keep myself busy or if Im a psychopath I fidget a lot and I cant keep my hands to myself I dont know if its because I feel so out of place or if its because I feel so uncomfortable all the time and thats why I do all of these things. I just feel so strange and I agree with people when they call me a weirdo even though I hate to admit it I feel so on edge all the time and I dont know how to calm myself down. Im so hyper all the time. But at the same time if I stay calm, I feel like Im boring the person and then I panic and then I start acting like a weirdo its a never ending cycle Im constantly daydreaming because I hate my current situation and weirdly enough when I imagine talking to someone my lips move and it seems like Im talking to myself which is super embarrassing.",

I seem to get away from everyone, and after some manic episodes some of them find me pretty weird. Im very sad that Im supposed to be having not only a good time, but a great time, instead Im miserable, jealous, and apparently somewhat suicidal. I hate it that Im staying in bad feeling sad and depressed, and feeling sad and depressed about feeling sad and depressed. And Im having the worse time in such magical teenage years. I dont expect anyone to solve this to me, their is nothing to solve, just keep going to therapy and take my pills that seem to get more intense with time instead of less Im just asking for some recognition of the pain, and maybe some people to tell me how it gets better, its kind of stupid, but it helps a little, thinking it might ever end and Im not messing my best years",
    "Medication mood drops Hi, Ive been on two medications for a short time. Clomipramine for my depression and Methylphenidate commonly known as ritalin for ADHD. While I have noticed and upturn in my general mood, it seems to drop throughout the day at regular times. Before 10am, Im actually quite good and productive. By 11, I can feel a real drop in my mood. By 1pm Im completely gone and miserable for the rest of the day. Basically Im just wondering if others have experienced this kind of mood drop when put on meds. I feel it must be a positive in the sense that I have a decent mood in the morning but I hate how quick it drops off. Any tips? Ive told my doctor and Im not after real medical advice. Just asking if anyone else has experienced this and whether it got better.",

She starts binding my arm, even though I was the one who caused her to be so sick, and she acted like nothing happened and tried to comfort me as I started shaking. I feel so bad.

    "Stuck in room and need help getting out Lately its been a bit rough. I sleep a good 16 hours a day and eat just one meal a day. I just feel like a log, but unfortunately I have very sweet housemates and I worry Ive disappointed them beyond repair. I try to avoid interactions with them and it feels horrible. I want to get up, clean my room, contribute to the home by cooking meals and all that.

    "Dating someone with depression - help Hi, This is a throwaway account. I need some help andor advice. About a half a year ago I 32F started dating someone M42 absolutely amazing. We share interest, same humor, honesty have been there since the beginning, we can talk about anything, even shared deeply vulnerable stories and the sex is amazing as well. We seem to be able to connect in a way Ive never tried before and create this space where it is just us. Green flags all the way. I quickly fell madly in love with him ofcourse. I shared my feelings for him about 4 months into it, told him no pressure at all since I wasnt ready for a full blown serious relationship and he didnt either. I have no doubt that he has feelings for me. Non. About 2 months ago he fell deep down into depression. He told me. I told him if there was anything I could do to help? He said maybe. I told him I was there if he needed to talk. He said thank you. Asked him if he wanted to meet up again soon? He said he was feeling so bad and was overwhelmed at work he works a lot. I said no problem, you just write me when the time is better, no pressure and Im not mad. Take your time. He said he would. Its been a month since that last text, and I havent heard anything. My guts tell me to just wait, but I am worried and a little unsure of how to handle this situation.. Should I keep on waiting I am not in a hurry and if Im not going to continue my relationship with him I dont feel like dating at all right now or should I reach out? afraid of preassuring. Abandoning him is not an option. Please give me some advice or share if you have a similare story. I would love to hear from someone who has depression and who is dating someone who hasnt.",
    "I feel like my subconscious is trying to keep me depressed Lately Ive been struggling with my mental health. Its gotten to the point that I feel physically sick from it, and Im fed up. Im a person who gets stuck on details and repeating the past in my head over and over to the point that I get sick. And then the next day Ill be extremely hyper and euphoric for about 4 hours and swing immediately back into this depressive state like its my default state. I feel like no one likes me and that I have no friends, and the reason that Im in a leadership position in theatre is because my director feels bad for me. Although people tell me that thats not true I cant engrain that into my head for some reason. Part of me knows that Im being irrational and overthinking everything, but I cant stop. It feels like Im subconsciously looking for something to upset me and get me down so I can keep feeding my depression, and I hate it. I want to get better, I really really do, yet my brain wont let me. I keep making things a way bigger deals in my head than they actually should be. I keep feeling like people are out to get me when theyre not. Its like I have tow people living in my head, the depressed one is in charge, and the rational one is being held captive and out of control. Its negatively impacting my relationships. Please, Im begging, if anyone knows how to stop this please tell me. Im so tired of everything getting spun out of control in my head.",
    "I'm not sure how to tell my mother I'm depressed Trigger warning NSFW  there will be mentions of self harm Before anyone jumps to any conclusions please know I love my mother. Shes has an interesting way of handling situations. She just wants best for me and everyone and doesnt know how to handle certain situations. I think the beginning was 7th grade. Its the age when Im told kids around my age go through their adolescent stage. They become defiant of their parents and so forth. Im not sure if this is applicable for everyone but I was one of the kids who defied their parents and acted like a brat. Im certain from grade 7 it was just my teenage phase but now Im not sure because at grade 8 and 9 these mood swings got progressively worse and I began to act more sad than just moody. In grade 9 I ended up going to the office to have a talk with the counselor. Dont shame me for this but I had just began to use social media and my account was small so only my friends knew my account. Maybe it was for the better but I had posted on my story that I was going to ct myself for everyone friend of mine. During this time my family was in the rough. My parents were talking about divorce because they were living apart for too long and their gears just didnt click well together after being apart for too long and just recently getting to live with each other. I dont know what had gotten to me because I probably shouldnt have posted such a sensitive topic but I posted it but didnt completely follow through with it. I did very minor scratches. Maybe I was seeking comfort and attention. Anyways, I had posted it, this concerned my friends and it went all the way to the schools counselor and I ended up having a talk. I just bawled during the counsel meeting and asked if this would get to my parents and the counselor said yes. I didnt want to let my parents know because it would simply add fuel into the fire with my parents constantly talking about divorce. Anyways long story short this got to my parents and things got just a bit messier. My parents fought and mentioned my problems and blamed one another and it was difficult.",
    "jumbled mess/rant? (story + requesting advice idk) I want to see a doctor to get it clear if I have mild depression or something else. However I find it difficult to do so because I dont know how much it would cost as Im not financially stable and the culture and country I live in does not see depression well. I overthink everything. I think thats a main reason why I selfdeprecate. Because of that my selfesteem has dropped over the years that I feel I cant do anything good. I am rethinking my choice of study whether it was a good decision. I dont think I am fit to become a childcare teacher. I understand that the principal and mentor are trying to help my future but negative thoughts just keep entering my mind. I should probably go study something different in university... its hard to imagine teaching children anymore. Ive cut down on using instagram because I know it wont do me any good seeing how others live their lives. Sometimes it just triggers my overthinking whenever I see their posts. Ive been told I think too much, that I think for awhile before I reply when this person just wants to hear my honest answer. I think it kind of frustratessaddens her because she wants me to vocalise my thoughts and feelings instead of bottling up, but I still do. She says shes a call or text away but it is so difficult to contact her first because I dont want to bother her with my problems. Well I guess Ill just share these. Sorry if its really unorganised, I just needed to get some things out before I have a breakdown.",

    "Is being home triggering my depression? Hi. Im not too familiar with this subreddit but honestly I really need someone to talk to right now. Ive been diagnosed with medical depression anxiety for a couple years now, taking medication and am now generally doing pretty well. I started college in the fall and the semester was amazing. However, since winter break started Ive been having awful feelings about just living. I wouldnt say I have major suicidal tendencies but heck Ive thought about it. I want to pain to go away so badly. Its gotten to the point where I feel physically sick. I cant stop crying. I feel awful. Im lonely here and things arent the way they used to be. That automatically fills me with anxiety. I havent felt this way in so long and I thought I never would again. I dont know what I need but maybe someone here could help. Im scared to fall asleep because of the nightmares Ive been having. Maybe someone could talk. Idk.",
    "Afternoon Anxiety and Depression For the past couple of months I have had really bad anxiety and depression at night. I have been dealing with both for years now, almost I think since middle school, Im 27 now. However, since August of last year, when I had my first and only anxiety attack, I was out with my friends and my anxiety got so bad that I had force them to call me an uber so I could just go home and sleep it off. I told myself and my parents that if I didnt feel better in the morning, I was going to the hospital. I never felt that bad in my life and I have been worried about it happening again. There are a lot of stressful things going on in my life right now, somethings that I think maybe life changing, but I cant be sure until the time comes and it might be sooner then later. I can elaborate if you guys want, but its a long story. I feel fine in the morning, I feel great in the morning. Im very positive and eager to get things done. It hits me around 3 or 4 pm. Something will trigger it that will cause me to think negative thoughts and it will affect me the rest of the night, but if I had that same thought at like 9 am, I would shrug it off and think, something like It not happening now, so dont worry about it. It has ruined a lot of things for me. Going out with friends is now dreadful. I used to look forward to hanging out with people, but now I would rather stay at home. My sleep schedule is going to bed as early as possible because I cant stand the anxiety. It even stops me from doing chores, I drop everything and want to sleep. It seems like ever since I had the anxiety attack, this has been happening every night. Am I subconsciously worrying about having another panic attack? What can I do to help ease my thoughts. I would love to go out with my friends again without feeling this way. I am seeing a Psychologist and taking meds at the moment. Insurance sucks, so a therapist would cost me 70 and I dont have the money for it and money is probably my biggest anxiety factor.",

    "I’m lost Suicide thoughts First of all , I wanna say sorry for my bad English. I didnt go to psychiatrist , but Im pretty sure I have depression for 4 years . Back then I just felt like I lost all my positive emotions for no reason all of suden and I told it to friends and family and everybody was like  Its normal, it happens , it will disappeared... I cannot feel almost anything, when someone close to me die, I cant cry , when something good happens ,I cant smile sometimes but very rare I can feel euphoria  . I had no motivation and hope for better future then, and now is same . I have little health problems for 5 years ,and I cant even force my self to go to doctor because Im affraid of diagnosis, and things are worse now. People think Im doing a little bit better then earlier because I passed my entrance examination for college one month agolast year all my friends did it, I decided to make a one year break  . But college dont change anything. I m still big pesimits and cant feel anything. Actually I can feel fear. I have very strong social anxiety. I have 5 very close friends , they are like brothers to me and Im relaxed when Im with them , but when I talk to girls , Im totally confused. They even cant understand what Im saying because I dont open my mouth enough and speak very quiet ... I never had a girlfriend... Lets go back to social anxiety. Its very hard to go to for example market because Im overthinking what if someone asks me something, ... I have very good relationship with mother, not good but no bad relationship with sister , and very bad relationship with father its almost hate . I also have very often mood changings and I also take decisions very hard because I dont know what I want , and even when I take a decision, I change it very quick . I like watching soccer and basketball but its hard to concentrate to watching because my mind flyes somewhere... I cant find purpose of life. People dont understand how its hard when someone says  JUST FORCE YOURSELF AND GO TO DOCTOR , JUST GO OUT MAKE NEW FRIENDS ,... Sorry for long message .",

I might change my mind later but for now I cant. When I see you care about me, I get hurt. he even offered to pay for my flight because I shouldnt just come there to take care of someone whos full of shit since I cant get a refund, but I refused. Its been about two days, and at the end of our messaging and phone calls, I told him that I am still going to catch that flight, and that Ill give him the space hes asking for, but that Im here whenever he needs me. sorry if its hard to read, and no tldr because I think its important to know everything that I wrote above before saying anything... Im just really desperate to talk to someone about this, and I really do need advicesupport. How can I support him, aside from giving him space?

    "Any advices you would like to share on uplifting self esteem and self awareness ? I have been facing depression over the past couple of years but it only accelerated last 6 months when I lost my job and moved back with my narcissistic parents. Thanks to my over protective and overly concerned parents, I turned out to be an adult who cannot standup to himself, who turned out to be a weakling, lack basic social skills and more importantly does not have the faintest idea who he is, what makes him happy, or the very least what he wants to do with his life. I have been living suicidal over the past 2 months, researching on methods I could deploy to end this no good life, having no point in living. But to be honest, I guess somewhere down there, there is something that tells me that not all doors have closed. I recently had a quick convo with a therapist and with the intial analysis she put forward with my situation, she mentioned that the probable root caus,e that is prone for a quick fix is my lack of self awareness and self esteem. I felt that is true, because I sort of feel like I do not have an identity, like.. Having an opinion on somethinganything, having the strength to stand up to myself, knowing what it is that makes me happy, be it a hobby or an interest. I mean when I spend time with people, maybe friends, or colleagues. They tend to know a lot about the world. Some may be knowledgeble about basic things people should know, some maybe a youtube content provider or some other maybe a social point of source. I want to do something with my life as well like being good at something, but all I do is consume datainformation reddit,trivial information etc.. and not produce any maybe writing a blog because I cant understand what fancies me. ampx200B I want to make my life better, but I just dont know where to begin and I feel like so Lost !",

Ive spent days watching it but realized its ruining me and the young version of him doesnt even exist. Hes old and ugly now. I just became obsessed with the thought that if I was alive in the 80s I could of dated Him and be apart of the exciting life of rock n roll.

    "How do I (14 M) talk to my (Typical Indian) dad about seeing a therapist? Tldr at bottom Hey guys. So, for context I am a 14 yo dude from India. I have a typical Indian dad, so that means conservative and not so openminded, and we arent close either. We havent really talked about anything else other than studies and me being a failure in the past... 3 years or so. I have been depressed and suicidal for about 2 years now and have been cutting for about a year. I think I might have anxiety, but not really sure about that. So, with that in mind, heres whats I need help with About a month ago, I tried talking to my dad about my cuts. I went to him and showed him my recent scars and he asked what they were. I told him they were cuts with a razor blade and he didnt ask me why but instead started screaming at me about me not studying and that I cut myself because of Youtube As it had rotten my brain. He told me that he would have listened to me and helped if I had gotten good grades Like, above 95 but since I havent gotten good grades I have like a 7580 overall, he doesnt give a fuck. I couldnt even tell him about what was bothering me. The first thing I said was insecurities, and he said I dont know the first thing about being insecure. Then I said anxiety and he went on and on about how I have no anxiety and its all just due to Youtube. This went on and on and I just stopped speaking. Like half an hour in, he told me that I should just take a knife and slice my wrists so I can die once and for all and how it would be great and he wouldnt give a shit This was pretty descriptive. He told me exactly where to cut and how much time it would take me to die. Also, to slice them in the bathroom sink so the bedroom doesnt get dirty After like 1.52 weeks after this convo, he came into my room and told me that he got irritated because he couldnt understand what caused me to do it and he had cried later that night. Now I dont know if I should believe him or not.",

He stayed for 2 weeks and weve only just been talking online after that. He has always had a problem of me having a different opinion from his. We have different views about things and I dont mind it, but it annoys him. He said I think hes stupid because I dont believe him. Believing him means agreeing with him. I held on because hes my first boyfriend and we didnt have any problem when he was here. He has good qualities and I chose to focus on those instead. However, we had a big fight today and I realized its gonna be hard living together if he cant even agree to disagree. Im so heartbroken. He has been my pillar for so long.

    "This is a cry for help... I spent the next 8 months completely depressed. I can describe my mood like instead of blood, some sort of black ink was being pumped into my vessels. I spent nights crying and punching the wall. I moved to another town for college. Dated 3 more girls but I couldnt love them and I still wanted that specific girl. I dropped out of college and moved back to my hometown to my family to start studying for the big test again and get accepted in a university. How did that happen? 8 months after my breakup, While I was spending my days and nights depressed as fuck, I saw something on Instagram. A girl from my hometown whom I had a crush on for a year followed me on Instagram. I saw her post and stories to know her better, and she was EXACTLY my type. Her taste in music, her beliefs atheist and her style and her face. She was kinda the one. As Persian names are not familiar to you, I refer to her as Jane. And, I refer to myself Jack. I started talking to her on Instagram, and we hit it off. I reached one of my girlfriends who knew her. And asked her if Jane is single. She said she got back together with one of her ex boyfriends, and that guy is a fucking douche. He had convinced Jane that their breakup was her fault and she needed to grew up. Jane is also 19, and the guy was 20. That guy was driving Jane crazy. He disrespected her in every possible way and didnt care. I saw that as a great opportunity that when they breakup again, I can date her and treat her the way she deserved to be treated. So I waited. But the next day, that friend told me that Jane asked her did Jack say anything about me to you? She said no, but told her that a long time ago she heard from one of her friends that Jack is into Jane. She told me that the moment she told that to Jane, Jane got very happy and excited, and told her that she has a crush on me too. I couldnt believe what I heard. I wanted her but she was into me too?",
    "why do I feel a void, or a hole in my chest? Disclaimer I am sorry if this post doesnt fit, but Ive tried posting elsewhere and havent gotten help. I have not been diagnosed with depression nor have I felt as if I did before. To start, I watched this video on YouTube after scrolling through my recommendations for a bit. httpsyoutu.bemB_0FXiFHd0 To be honest, I thought it was pretty sad, and it spoke to me in a way Ive never felt. Afterwards, I began to feel an emotional hole in my chest, or, a void. Im not sure what feeling this video triggered, but its happened to me only a few times before, and its never been this bad. Going on 6 days now, whenever i think of the girl in the video, I think of the song and what she went through. I feel it. It doesnt matter where I am, what I am doing, or who Im with. Ive also began to feel less motivated to do things in my pastime. As a naive junior in hs, Im really not sure what to make of all this. Help would be much appreciated. TLDR why do things make me feel a void in my chest?",
    "My brains are fried... Sometimes I cant help but laugh bitterly at the fact that I used to be the smartest in my class and now I struggle to focus and remember for even half an hour. I read things over and over and it hardly sticks. I feel like an idiot really. Even things that interest me are hard. Part of me wants to just give up, cause the thing I am studying isnt even that useful, its more to help myself. Is there any way I can improve my brain?",
    "Having no money is a huge source of depression and I hate it when people try to convince me otherwise Its not about not being able to afford stuff for yourself, its about not feeling safe, not knowing if youll afford to live and always having weight on your shoulders. Im 18 and my mom kicked me out of the house half a year ago on my birthday. Ive always worked for my own money but since covid situation here in Europe is really bad I cant find a job with not even finished highschool Im a straight A student but that wont matter since Ill probably have to focus on work not university. Im barely scraping with help of friends but they are struggling too at the moment so Im kinda alone. Im on a 10 weekly budget for food and Im really at my edge. Ill figure something out when covid passes but I have to survive to that point. I can bearly pick myself up from bed every morning and I feel stuck.",
    "I kill myself if you don’t read My upbringing only perpetuated my depression. My single mom never gave me responsibilities and I had too much free time. Making it worse I was a nerd so having the option to just stay inside and play video games was heaven. Years went by without speaking with anyone or trying to build relationships. In my teen years that was basically suicide because who wants to be known as the loner. So I would skip days to keep my fragile ego safe. Thoughts go by in my head that if I could just at the very least get over my fear for rejection I could get my life in order. Because having an intimate relationship would really solve a lot of current issues I have. And so Im actively looking subconsciously and consciously because i am starving for intimacy. I know how that would look desperate maybe a bit crazy. And its not about sex its about completely being open and honest with another person. I feel I can only be this intimate with a girl and refuse to open up to such an extent to the access of other human beings in my life. Because the human being in my life were not driven by choice ie family, childhood friends Im in a pickle and it sucks, but if it wasnt for weed I would not be aware of my issues, stayed positive and attempt to help myself. This is only a recent discovery ever since joe Rogan started talking about how weed paranoias actually help you figure out what is actually stressing you out. Thats the worst about depression, every action you do against yourself feels justified and logical. Its truly a terrible disease and I hope I survive this. Sorry about title Im just so desperate I apologize for my existence.",
    "Pretty sure I’m the least favorite child My mom f, 45 treats me FtM trans, 20 like shit, yet my younger brother m, 4 is allowed to hit her, swear at her, scream his demands at her, etc without getting more than a quiet dont do that. Hes become the brattiest and most rude child Ive ever seen. He used to be a very nice and polite kid, but now he knows he can get away with being a total asshole, so he constantly acts like a total asshole. He says stuff like give me the TV remote or Ill kill you and cut your eyes out, like horror movie scenarios. I get screamed at if I try to discipline him and tell him he doesnt need to be saying that sort of thing. If I was to do the same thing, I would be screamed at, told to get a job Im mentally and physically disabled, currently going through occupational therapy to help find me a suitable job, but this isnt enough to keep her happy, have things taken away, etc. Another brother of mine m, 14 completely agrees that my moms parenting is ineffective. My mom is nicer to him than she is to me, but shes still unnecessarily rude to him as well. Weve both tried bringing it up to her, but she just gets defensive and resorts to personal attacks against us both. For example, for me she would say something like well you dont work and youre taking all my money and for my brother she would say stuff like well youre just on your computer all day. She also defends her crappy parenting by saying you wouldnt understand, youre not a parent I may not be a parent and I dont plan on ever being one, but at least I know that no one, much less 4 year old children, shouldnt be punching people to get what they want and using threatening demands. I dont know how much longer I can keep taking all these attacks while my little brother is allowed to be a dick. Its taken a huge toll on me and I constantly feel like Im never doing good enough in life. I know Im the family disappointment by being trans, autistic, and fat, but god fucking dammit Im trying my best. But my best is never and has never been enough.",
    "How to stop crying all the time? Hi there, TLDR  I cry so much and not sure how to calm myself down enough to not cry. Im not always even sure why i am crying, it just starts running down my face. Im on month 7 of my current severe depressive episode. My bipolar causes me to have usually 6 months of depression every year, but this time it feels worse than in many years, and also its just getting worse despite having lasted quite a while for my usual pattern. Im considered treatment resistant with meds, though about to try out a 13th or 14th new medication. Im also struggling to access adequate support. I am crying every day recently, today being particularly bad. Ive had 4 or 5 bouts of crying since I got up about 5 hours ago. Nothing has actually happened today, so I dont know why. Im tired of this. Id love some ideas on how I can find some more calm. I do yoga in the evenings, but its a recent thing and I probably have to do it for a while to see improvements. On a positive note, I handed in all the medications I no longer take to the pharmacy for safe disposal yesterday. This makes me a lot safer in terms of suicide risk, and whilst it makes me quite anxious not to have it as an option in the back of my head, I know it was the right thing to do. I dont have any pills that could kill me in an overdose now.",
    "I’ve been so depressed that I’ve had suicidal ideation for several days and feel like no one cares. I have been depressed for several weeks now to tje point where I have thoughts to end my life several times a day. I push them away, usually, but I really feel alone in what is going on. While my best friend knows, I dont want to burden her any more bc she has a lot going on. And when I told a few other close friends about the turmoil I was feeling, they said they needed time to process it and never addressed the issue again. I feel like this is a sign they dont care.",
    "Am i a bitter person? Am I a bitter person? Hi guys Please can you try amp be as honest amp raw as possible, i really dont mind if comments are a bit brutal as feel like I need the truth telling! Okay, so i am incredibly insecure, 22 year old, i come from an incredibly broken home parents messily divorced, narcisstic mother, abusive older sister. My mum never showed me any direct love or any care just left to my own devices all my life leaving me to learn lifes hardest lessons on my own. Hoenstly a majority of life for me has been constant negative events, everything i love becomes everything i loosemy friendsfamilyjob self respect, esteem nothing ever goes right for me. All i know is sadness being let down being dumped feeling sad. All my life since the young age of like 7,8, Iv always dreamed of a boy loving me. I dont know why this love had to come from a boy directly, but all my life Iv craved it, dream of it fantasized soo many things in my head just depserate to be loved. Im 22, never had a boyfriend, every single guy i go for has rejectived me because of how I look im not a size 8, but a size 22 instead and iv only ever known unrequited love. Im not at an age mentally amp physically and emotionally where im ready to settle down and crave this life with a man who is going to look after me, and bring up a child in all the ways i want and give it what my parents failed to give me. All my friends are getting engaged, it kills me inside to know im not the type of girl anyone wants to marry. For this reason, I cannot stand seeing other couples, and women happily in love. My cousin who i am very close to, married the love of her life and they now have a boy, a girl. The perfect perfect family. On the recent birth of her daughter about 3 weeks ago The whole family was so ecstatic. But when i heard, i ran into my room amp sobbed. I sobbed that why cant that be me. Shes got it all now, a son, and a daughter. And why cant I have that?",
    "I literally can't do anything right now For the past few weeks Ive been feeling more and more depressed. Ive had it controlled well for years but things happening all at once has just brought me to tears at this point. I have a bf, hes amazing but one thing that I would say is wrong with him is he doesnt know how to support me when Im like this. Hell ask whats wrong, If theres something specific Ill tell him, but its been so many things its just everything. And he doesnt know how to respond to that. It just makes me feel incredibly lonely. I havent been able to get out of bed yet 1.30pm here and he just happily stayed on his computer and now hes gone out. I just want to feel better, go about my day but I cant. Theres nothing I want to do. Nobody I know I want to talk to. Im just laying here. How do I get out of this?",
    "Both me and my spouse are depressed Then if there are any people, dogs, noises, or wind, he starts to panic, so I do too, he usually helps stabilize my moods, but were both afraid of people so it turns into a feedback loop. Hes house trained because most of the time, even when I get him hyped up to go outside and put his leash on, he just freezes at the door and refuses to go outside, and if I pick him up and put him down on the grass he just stands there. We live in a trailer park and our yard is about 10 feet wide, so theres no privacy. We both are hermits and dont like interacting with people and Im autistic so I just... cant converse verbally normally. We have no friends locally even though weve been here for a few years. I just got out of a bad friendship and at this point cant really be bothered to try to have another friend in fear Ill get myself in the same situation. On top of everything, Im going through an existential crisis and find no comfort in my hobbies I used to enjoy. Neither of us really do anything. We play video games and I draw, but thats about it. I have suicidal tendencies but havent tried for a while, but have been close to downing pills again. He isnt suicidal per se, but when hes at work he gets thoughts akin to ideations, but when were together were both fine. At this point, I honestly dont know what to do. Sure, theres plenty of stuff to be done, but I have issues prioritizing things, so I just see this long list and get overwhelmed and end up doing nothing. Our pets and plants still get cared for, and I can do some house chores our place is a fixer upper to say the least, but most of the day I just sit in paralyzing existential dread. Im too dead set on rationing my medicine from trauma that I either wont allow myself to take my sedatives even when I should or am scared that Ill have the urge to eat them all and kill myself. Dont overdose, kids, it aint as romantic as the movies make it out to be. It just feels hopeless.",
    "I can’t feel anything, no matter what I do, I can’t feel anything physically or mentally I am a 17 yo male, who comes from an extremely abusive household, and Ive recently noticed that my feelings are almost non existent. I also cant feel any pain, some might think its a gift but its a fucking curse. Im numb to the core and I just want to be normal again. I havent eaten in 3 days because if I try to I throw up. Ive been getting 4 hours of sleep regularly and cant physically sleep longer than that. My father used to beat me and force me to torture rodents with him. I remember one time he made me drown a possum in a garbage can and hack a squirrels limbs off. By the time I was 8 years old I had already known how to disassemble, clean, and reassemble a .38 caliber pistol. My father was a narcissist, and I was his golden child. If I ever did anything wrong I was told I was making our family look bad. Id get a hell of a beating if I even said anything out of line, and my mother was constantly in and out of hospitals from her accidents. I believe my father is a large part of why I am feeling the way I am recently. I noticed I stopped feeling emotion when I had a stroke last March. I wasnt scared, or worried, I was calm, and didnt even feel anything. Even after I had almost lost my ability to play guitar, I wasnt sad or scared. Ever since then, its just gotten worse and worse. My girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me and all I had to say to her was ok. Honestly it was probably best for her, I dont know if I can feel love anymore, so whats the point of trying. I recently noticed I cant physically feel pain when I was trying to fix the shingles on my roof. I missed with the hammer and smacked my hand right on the thumb, but I didnt feel anything. Just to test my theory, I smacked the back of my hand full force. I heard the crunching of bone, but still felt no pain. I dont know whats wrong with me.",
    "Which antidepressant worked for you? Hi all, Ive been actively fighting my depression for years, since I realize it was there. Ive been taking Lexapro for a couple years now. Seems to take the edge off the worst of it but like today I woke up really depressed, ie dont want to live anymore, life feels meaningless and just endless pain and disappointment, I feel like I serve everyone around me and no one really cares about me. Im not suicidal...well lets be real, I am because of the depression but Ive decided not to remove myself from life... Thatll happen whether I like it or not and itll always be an option but since its so permanent Id prefer to see if I can fix my brain and be delusionaly happy like normal people. So what worked for people? Appreciate it before I try the permanent option. Thanks all!",
    "I am the problem It was always me who didnt fit in. People dont like me and I dont understand why. No matter what I do, Ill always be an outcast, Ill be always made fun of. Theres something about me that other people hate. I push people away. Im 21 years old and I never had real friends. At 13 I lost all of my friends and I havent made new ones. I missed out on life. On those first experiences, parties, all of the fun that teenagers do. I dont even feel comfortable talking to men, because I never had male friends I have never been invited to a party. I have never smoked or took alcohol I never spoke with someone other than my relatives on phone or skype Its hard for me to make friends now, because of lack of these experienced. Everyone has their friend group from high school, but I was bullied in middle and high school. Recently, my 17 cousin laughed at me because Im a virgin. Its true. I never had the opportunity to explore, because I had no one to explore things with And it hurts me, because I have no idea how to flirt with men or even keep a relationship. Recently, I was texting this guy and he weirded out that I never had sex or kissed someoneMy lack of experience pushed him away Without these necessary experiences its hard to be accepted. I feel like hanging myself. Help.",
    "I've lost all of my friends So I just lost all of my friends because I overreacted on a dumb little thing. One of my best friends just recently ended our relationship and the rest from my group of friends ignore me, I fucked up pretty badly. Its because they offered me attention, affection, they helped me a lot of times, and Ive done nothing in return. They dont respond to my messages anymore and we are all classmates. I dont know what to do, I dont think I can do anything about it",
    "19 years old and its pretty obvious there's no reason to go any further Id rather live in the wild foraging for food like a monkey over working my ass off for hours a day just for money green paper that people think is so good and meaningful I just dont understand. It feels like I was born on the wrong planet or the wrong time and to make it all worse no matter how long I sit and logically think about it I cannot think of way out of this hell other than suicide, just selling my timelife away as a slave, or just being homeless. And to top it all off when I was 13 or 14 my hair started thinning and during high school with my thin hair everyone Including every single person close to me even teachers started making fun of me saying things like crackhead or you look like an old man, you look like a hobo, Looks like Albert Einstein, Do you wash your hair? and while it sounds hilarious from an outside perspective eventually after hearing dozens of different people say this constantly my entire juniorsenior year it has really dragged me through hell and back just trying to keep myself from going completely insane and it caused me to completely lose any self confidence I once had. All that I really want is a female to love me and a place of my own to stay at without having to owe other people anything. Just me and a lover free to be ourselves to do what we want, live how we want but theres always someone else who thinks its in their place for you to owe them money and money is whats completely ruined my idea of a happy life. Its literally unfair for someone else to tell me how to live but the government thinks they can tell people weed is illegal to possess yet thats fake as fuck like nothing is illegal if it was then some nonhuman force would seek redemption for me possessing weed but no, its other people telling ME that Ill be punished by other human beings if I have weed by throwing me in a cage for doing something of my own consent. or insert anything illegal that I choose to have in my life Does the government have consent of MY BODY? Yes they do if they can throw me in a cage for ingesting something of my choosing. Is living as a truly independent human just completely impossible? To live without being under someone elses rule?",
    "I'm so tired I wanted it to stop, I just wanted this awful string of events to end already, yet whenever I got scared or overwhelmed all I was told was to get through it to summer, but I couldnt. I didnt think I could do it, at this point I was being told it would get better soon for months on end but everything got worse. They said thats just life, theres always something to get in your way but you have to do it regardless, but I couldnt cope with that anymore, I couldnt cope with that awful reality. I just didnt enjoy living anymore, and if its this bad now as only a highschooler I couldnt imagine myself being older, in an actual work environment where the same problems persisted. I wanted it to end so badly, nothing was improving and the foreseeable future looked awful and stressful. I promised myself that if it got this bad again Id ask to see a therapist again, it took a couple weeks. Sometime towards the end of next week I learned that I was also taking the SAT another standardized test infamous for not working in the southeast in about ten days, leaving me with not nearly as much time to prepare as I thought. I broke down completely, preparing for the AP exam took enough out of me alone, but two of them back to back was a death sentence for me. I kept crying over the idea that it got worse again, that whenever I thought I was at rock bottom it just kept going downhill, no mtter what I did I would continue to feel awful about living itself. I laid out a ten day study plan to go through, saying that in ten days it would be over and the better times everyone talked about would finally be here, it hurts to say but I dont think thats happening. I remember the next day where during all of class I lied in bed, not saying a word to the friends I usually talk to all day, it just all felt so hopeless.",
    "Those who’ve dealt with it longer than I - how? So Im a 20 y.o. F whos currently on her sophomore year in college. I was diagnosed with severe depression and a panic attack disorder about two years ago. Since then Ive dealt with two changes in medication, a suicide attempt and moving away to my own apartment and away from all my family and friends. Since starting school Ive realized Ive become incredibly isolated. The only time Ill have human touch is when my boyfriend visits me for the weekend, and unless a professor or a group member speaks to me, generally throughout the day I wont have a conversation with anyone. Even my parents dont talk to me everyday. Ive joined a DnD group and have made attempts to push myself out of this crippling isolation but how do you make friends when more than have your days are bad mental health days? My depression has worsened significantly since moving and to help myself I got a 3 month old puppy that Im training to be my service animal. Honestly, that baby is most of the reason I get out of bed as puppies dont care if you have depression  they need to be trained. Ive also made another doctors appointment to see about yet another med adjustment. I also got in contact with a therapist but I honestly dont see how it will help much being as though I can only go to one session a month. I just dont know how Im supposed to live like this? Like is this going to be my life from now on just barely struggling by with less than a hand full of people who would actually give a shit if I failed miserably? I just need to hear from more experienced depressed individuals how did you survive?",
    "I think I'm depressed but scared to come out about it Over the past year and this Ive had moments where Im happy and not a care in the world but is normally followed up by me contemplating how bad my life is going and how I wish it could be better and how my past self would hate the person Ive become. I feel so pathetic unable get out of this pit Ive put myself in, being demotivated to do school work, lacking enjoyment in things I used to do. I recently during a lock down before my mocks told my parents briefly about how I was feeling, but didnt come forward completely, probably as a fear of being judged. They then contacted the school but I had a week or two of feeling good around that time so I ended up shrugging everything off and saying that I feel fine. The problem is really dont now and am afraid to tell my parents after I already said Im feeling better now previously",
    "Need a good book for my depressed teen and I to work through together My 13 year old has been saddepressedoverly stressed for a long time now. Recently he has shared that he has started to have moments of invasive suicidal feelings. We developed a code word for him to let me know when he feels that way and he likes me to sit with him at those times but I know we need more help. He doesnt want to go back to counseling even with a different counselor and we have talked to his Dr who wants him to try using some strategiescopinglife changes. He is kinda willing to go through a book with me and asks why he should go to a counselor because he can talk to me, doesnt know a counselor well enough to trust them, his past counselor didnt help, and in general dismisses all my answers that include they are professionals, counseling has helped me, counselors can be trusted, we can interview a couple different therapists, science backs counseling etc. Help me find a not cheesey workbook, toolkit book, etc for us to go through. Ideally one that would be good for a teen. Hes not super on board with improving sleep, etc so if a book gives good logic hed be more open to it than me or his Dr suggesting it. We are liberal science embracing Christians so open to books with or without a Christian perspective but science based is must. Thanks, A worried mom",

    "i had to say goodbye to my sweet boy today after finding out yesterday cancer is ravaging his body. the vet said he has never seen anything like what was shown on those scans, that my sweet maximus was a very very sick little boy. the inside of his spleen was supposed to look like peanut butter, but instead it looked like chunky jelly with chunks and lumps he could not identify. his body had developed multiple tumors, which were cancerous. he had gone into tumor lysis crisis meaning that a large amount of the cancer cells that were comtained in these tumors died, and released their cancerous contents into his blood. they were killing his red blood cells and destroying the ability to regenerate any at all. his stomach had bloated 3x its normal size, even though it was just later in the day and yesterday morning it had looked fine. the vet discouraged us from treatment because he didnt see any possible way maximus could recover putting him on treatment would only prolong his suffering and ensure he passed painfully. which is cruelly ironic, as putting him on treatment would keep my suffering at bay. but i have to do right by my boy. hes been through too much and endured more than i can imagine, he was brought into this world in pain and i promised him when i brought him home he would leave it in love. i had to keep that promise. i love him more than it seems like my heart can handle, and making the right decision for him is the absolute utterly wrong decision for me. we got the vet this morning and despite not moving except to lift his head the past few days, he trotted off away from the building. i believe in the deepest place of my heart he knew what we were there for, and he was scared. he wouldnt let me turn him around back toward it, and the most he would take was two steps toward the building and then sit back down. i sat down with him and just sobbed. the thought of not having that big brown baby rips my heart into shreds and pierces my soul. we finally got him inside after i just sat with him and talked to him for about 15 minutes. ive never wanted to simply wait in a waiting room longer, but they called us right back.",
    "When you're the rock but have no one to lean on. Its Thanksgiving and I spent the day with my mom taking our beloved doggo to the vets because she was sick. Shes okay now but my mom was crying and I held myself together and was there for her. She thanked me for being there to help her remain calm and I am happy to be there for her. But inside the whole time I was freaking out and scared for the dog. I realized I dont have anyone to lean on. I have two guy friends but we have that whole dont talk about your emotions thing going on because were not good at discussing feelings. I see my therapist but she isnt always around and sometimes I just want to be held and be allowed to cry. Its hard always having to be strong when Im carrying the weight of depression with me everywhere I go.",
    "I wish I could just have a hug and die in somebody’s embrace Please I cant keep doing this I keep going going through a full range of emotion in like a 6 hours to a day. The highs dont make the lows worth it and i get filled with rage when someone suggests that they do. I dont want anyone to relate to me because it never goes further than yeah covid is messing everybody up. I cant enjoy anything because it only lasts an hour and then I fly off in a new direction. I just want to feel loved and feel someones arms around me. Anyone. If I could just slowly fade away in my moms arms thatd be perfect. I cant keep charring on this fire just because others might miss me. Id miss them too if I could take the memories with me. I love everybody but only until Im in pain and then everything is a living, fluid, and confusing hell. I find myself feeling that Id murder to die in a moment of love.",
    "Never having a drive. I dont know if this is depression, or another mental issue. But I have a great job, pays well, Im honestly so lucky to have it cause quite honestly I dont have any skills. But everyday I work I dont care, all I wanna do is sit, all I wanna do is just be. The job isnt hard or stressful but I still put in so little effort. I want to be good at my job, if I were to lose my job Id be lost. I go threw the day with one foot in front of another just pushing threw. Theres no need for this its so frustrating. My feet feel like lead, my anxiety spikes cause as I mosey around Im scared my boss will catch me, and fire me, and even that doesnt get me moving its like where is my drive and ambition, how can I push past this?... can I?",
    "The current situation has caused a HUGE setback Thank the good Lord for food stamps and Food Share, Ill never go hungry. So since Im disabled, waiting for benefits, my rent is 50month. I also had internet shut off because I couldnt pay them just 50 too. My needs are small Ive had help from friends and family, and then eventually from several local church charities. And, well, Ive run out of options and was scrolling through Reddit. I saw a couple of subs in which to ask for help. So I took a deep breath and posted how I need help paying my bills. The only reason I did this is that I have seen many messages of gratitude from individuals who received help. But that didnt happen for me. In fact there were some negative responses, and both posts where completely down voted. So, I guess either I dont know how to ask for help, or people just dont care. Lets add to my situation that my one good friend is going through some of their own challenges, and being a complete jerk. Ive heard that the economic stimulus package wont pay anyone who is not working. Figures, the people who need it the most get nothing. And I pray it is only a rumour, because 1000 could set me up for many months while I work on my disability claim. The California Governor has issued a shelter in place order. I have asthma pretty badly, so Im party of the group that SERIOUSLY shouldnt go out. Same with my motherinlaw. My anxiety and depression had returned in full force. I have thought, again of giving up on my life. There is really NOTHING good about it. At all. My sister has shunned me because she knows nothing about mental health, and thinks I should just be happy. Ive never really had any meaningful relationship with my mom. She has been emotionally unavailable my entire life. So what am I left with? A complete shut down. No news, or Internet. Im typing on my government phone which has very limited data. But at least I can post My friend is unavailable. Yesterday I went to my motherinlaws place so I could download some movies.",
    "Looking For Coping Methods My depression has been really declining lately. I live in a really bad household and Im being targeted by my grandfather whom nobody will stand up to and if I try to stand up for myself, Im the one in the wrong. Hes been yelling at me over small things, calling me all sorts of names, leaving stuff at my door for me to trip over, and more. This especially hurts because him and I used to be friends when my mother was the one being horrible and nasty She calls me disgusting, a few slurs, etc he was the one that was always there to comfort me and try and talk it out with her. Now, however, it feels like that never happened. It feels like I was the one who did something wrong, and I dont know what. Its seriously effecting my relationship with my boyfriend, friends, and myself. Its an incredible struggle to eat just a meal a day, my lips are getting torn because I pick at them, I cant ever get to sleep and stay asleep, its frustrating and since Im a teenager I cant leave this enviroment. What do I do to cope? I use music to try and melt away, I play games like animal crossing to stay distracted, I draw, I play ukulele, I just breathe and try to remember that it will pass. Im terrified of being suicidal, Ive attempted once and was lucky I know Im capable even if I dont want to and that scares me. What are some methods you guys use to deal with these sort of things? I desperately want to get better, but it feels like I cant here.",
    "Are antidepressants the nuclear option? Hi, I was in a serious car accident recently and walked away but Im left with some long term health issues that will take months to resolve because of waiting lists UK based. The health issues mean I cant take part in my main hobby as Ive been told that partaking in that hobby will lead to a worsening of the medical issue and lead to permanent damage. Over the last few weeks, Ive been struggling. Im low and on the verge of tears all day every day. I cant concentrate, I have brain fog, I forget what Im doing constantly, I have real trouble making any type of decision. I have a stressful job which requires me to be at my best, and Im not managing it very well. I take no enjoyment in anything I do, Im avoiding family and friends. The more time that passes, the worse I feel. Im guilty that I dont feel relieved that the outcome wasnt worse, Im angry that someone elses other drivers poor decision making has put me here. My friends and family my partner in particular are worried about me as I am not myself, I feel guilty about this too but cant bring myself to feel normal so I avoiding speaking to them. Im on a waiting list for counselling, and Ive been having regular catch ups with my doctor, but this week I spoke with someone new and within 5 minutes of speaking to me for the first time, she told me my symptoms suggested depression and prescribed antidepressants with a suggested minimum course of 1 year. I have a family history of depression, but this is the first time that I have been here, and medication feels like a huge step, especially seeing as she mentioned taking them for a year. I just want to get back to feeling like myself again, but what I have heard about antidepressants suggests that they wont be the magic fix. Am I right to be cautious of this new doctors advice or should I respect their medical experience and just go with it?",
    "I get the most depressed around my birth month I was born in September and not until a couple years ago I started feeling really depressed and sad during this time. As Soon as we hit the end of august a wave of depression comes over me and I just hate being here. I hate myself, the way I look, how I feel. Just over all disgusted with myself. And the voice in the back of my head just makes it worse Always saying things like oh another year and youre still nothing. Living at home no boyfriend, 2 jobs still no money, youre lazy and you gained weight over quarantine youre just pathetic and stupid and I see other people how pretty they are and how good their life is and it gets to me. I got frustrated yesterday and almost cried because I kept getting problems wrong on my math homework Im in college btw.

    "I need help Im going to open up and be honest just because Im at a breaking point. This is a breakup story that has been like non before. I M27 was dating a beautiful girl F24 on and off for three years. We met in college where we dated for a year before we separated the first time. In that first year she had to have surgery to remove a bone spur on her foot and put on some weight. Personally that doesnt bother me. Ive never cared for my ladies weight, Im more into the personality, but it mattered to her as I saw her put herself in a bout of depression, harsh judgements to herself, and ultimately was just very unhappy all the time. I did all I could, telling her not to worry about it, cooking healthier meals, telling her shes just not as active. And eventually after 6 months of recovery we started to go back to the gym but she was never the same so. And after having to remind her everyday, every conversation that everything would be ok to no aval, I broke up with her. I regret this decision. I made this decision because I too, to some degree am self conscious and at the time I took it as a response to me. I thought she was unhappy with me. We ended up trying again a short 4 months later but it too was short lived. Same result, every conversation wed have, shed talk about her weight, and I could see in her face how unhappy she was. This was also a bad time in her family as her mother just got breast cancer. So she went back home. On the way home AL gt KY her car broke down and without hesitation I drove the 4 hours to meet up with her to fix her car and drove back because I still loved her. During this time covid began and any shot of seeing her was gone. I just started a 6 month coding boot camp where my days were pretty much planned from 8am8pm Monday  Saturday. We had talked about how I could be a developer, working from anywhere and I could be with her and she was a marine biologist, so her work was dependant on location so I was okay with going wherever she needed to be. While in the bootcamp, we rarely talked, living our separate lives.",
    "I feel lonely even though there's no need to But I dont see how it is hard work to think about my friends at least once in some weeks. Maybe stuff like that is way more important to me than to others. I know that I love myself and who I am and thats why its even harder for me to understand this. Am I doing something wrong? Are my expectations too high even though, in my opinion, theyre pretty much as low as they could possibly get? Am I just knowing the wrong people? This is not something that gets me down on a regular base. Its more like a phase that lasts for a couple of hours and then Im fine again. But lately this has occured more often and for longer periods of time. And obviously this affects my daily life as well because once Im depressed I mostly just sit there and dont know what to do with my time. Everything suddenly seems boring. Even though one simple message for example, its not like this is the only thing that causes me to get depressed would potentially fix it. Sorry for this essay. Im not a native speaker so there could be some mistakes. But I do hope that at least someone takes the time to read through it and give me an honest opinion what I should do. How do you think I can convice them to think about me more often? It honestly seems like begging to me and I would rather avoid that. I just want the heartache to stop...",
    "It's so painful My best friend stopped talking to me 2 days back. Its been so lonely. I am having lucid dreams of him coming back. I am talking to an imaginary version of him in my head. Coz no one else understood me but him. Today my parents decided to stop talking or spending time with me. We have a duplex. I am supposed to stay in the upper flat. They do give me food water and everything. But its so painful. I am dying inside. My whole body is aching and I am feeling sick. I cant sleep well. I wish everything would just stop.",
    "I've given up trying to change because all I do feel less and less bad for myself when I fail Im an 18 year old male. Ive been able to do nothing but reject any help I get or fail trying to get myself back on track. Nothing really motivates me, other than distractions so Im not reminded that I wont be able to keep myself alive in the real world. Any support I receive now is all I rely on, and I have no reason to be lazy and unwilling to do anything about myself. Yet whenever I try, I always wind back to the start. I surround myself with positive people, but all I manage to do is shower them with support instead of myself. Ill admit, its because I know theyll use that support to succeed, unlike me. I used to be afraid that Id always be like this, but now its just a reality Ive accepted, and its made me bitter and unintentionally hostile towards those who know more about me than the carefree mask I put on. I like to think that when I get I job money will motivate me. It wont. Ill just be stuck in my own world and just accept the fact that Ive been fired after a week. Ive tried before. Its done nothing. Its a problem that affects all aspects of me. All of them. And it makes me feel like less of a person when I see others get back up from worse. When other people lash out at me for being defiant and wasting their support, or not being of any use or having any real reason to be kept around, I just sit there and take it with a blank face. They tell me things I already know, then try to lighten it by them just being angry in the moment, or just trying to get me to wake up. I know what they say is true, and I can tell that they hope to God that I come to my senses and start improving myself. Ive been this way as long as I can remember and nothing good has happened. Ive only become more numb to the situation and more accepting of my failure. I used to care. Alot.",
    "Lost motivation, want to quit... please help Fourthyear med student currently in the midst of clinicals. Just cant find the motivation to study or attend online tutorials or go for wards anymore. I feel so tired everyday, sometimes I wish I would just die in my sleep amp not wake up the next morning. Nowadays, whenever I try to study or listen to the online lectures, either my head feels like its in a haze amp nothing goes in, or I get palpitations, breathlessness amp feel like puking. amp in the wards, I feel totally dissociated from whats going on during rounds. Im so sick the endless cycle of trying to complete anki reviews amp revise my notes, in addition to having to cram in new information that the doctors in the wards quiz us on amp say we must know otherwise well fail the exams. Yet, whenever I try to take a break, I feel even more anxious amp guilty for slacking, amp cant enjoy any of the hobbies I used to like. My insomnia has been getting worse amp worse, amp the times that Im finally so tired that I crash, I dont wake up feeling refreshed in the morning. I seriously dk how my classmates manage to stay so enthusiastic about medicine amp how they have the stamina to constantly discuss studyrelated thingsmeet up for practice all the time. Also, Im so scared Ill turn into a monster lose my sense of humanity because it hasnt even been 2 years into clinicals yet amp already, I feel numb to patients stories like every other history I take has been reduced to symptom complex gt diagnosis gt investigations gt management plan. Its so disillusioning to see the doctors in the hospital so jaded amp overworked that over time, the focus just becomes discharging patients as fast as possible amp documenting changes on computers wheeled around the wards to protect against legal liability. Some of them even talk demeaninglymake snark comments about patients behind their backs, amp while I dont expect doctors to be saints, especially given the tough working conditions, it really makes me question my decision to join med school.

    "We were engaged. He left me for a 19 year old he has been talking to online for the past 3 months They also called at other times during the day that I never knew about. He also put ghost mode on on Snapchat so I couldnt see when he was there talking to her, and he was always saying it was a glitch I only believed that because Snapchat really is a very glitchy app, but none of the times I asked it was an actual glitch. He admitted everything after. They were flirting, sexting and everything and at the time it was just two months after they started talking. I only found out because a few days after I started getting suspicious, I messaged him asking if she had ever flirted with him. He said yes, and I freaked out. I also found out later on that the moment I sent him that message they were on a call, and he told her so she was pressuring him to tell me the truth. Thats the only reason why he said yes. Then as I saw he wasnt replying to my messages, I called him and obviously interrupted their call. He answered. This was a long call, I told him everything I had been suspicious about and he confirmed every single thing. Then, at night, we called again. Our longest video call ever. 9 hours and 37 minutes straight. Ive been so bad lately that I cant remember everything, but how it went was basically me telling him all my feelings, how I would do everything over and over again to have the same love and happiness feeling as I did when I went there, how I would sacrifice everything how many times I would need to, just to feel that way again. Then also about our dreams of having a family and everything, how he destroyed everything within a few days. Ive seen him cry lots in the past, but nothing like this night. He was bawling his eyes out. The call lasted all night. It ended at around 730am and I slept until 830am. He slept longer than I did. When he woke up, he sent me a long message apologizing, saying how bad he felt and begged for my forgiveness.",

Theres heaps more I can talk about like my addiction to games even when Im not enjoying them and the recent passing of artist xxxtentacion I know hes a very controversial person but I really enjoyed his music and just seeing his face and hearing his messages to his fans. Im failing at school since year 8 and Im always feeling worried about how I went in a test or having 1000 bricks on my chest scared what my mum will say when she sees how I went. I spent the entire 2nd half improving and trying my best especially in English where my teacher would repeatedly remind me Im an intelligent kid but Im just lazy, and when I thought I had improved I went from the first semester being all Cs and turned it into Cs and one D. I cant focus on anything important in class, I cant remember stuff and it feels like everything Ive explained in this post is coming together and ruining my life, making me feel hopeless and giving me a feeling of life being pointless. My ideal life right now would be one where I can stay home all day without worrying about any responsibilities or having to deal with my peers or school. Being around people seems to make me feel more lonely. Being around family im almost always happy. Avoiding all of these things feels like it would make me feel great again even though me in my right mind wouldve hated the idea of being alone at home all day with my boring parents. I dont know what to do. I want to see a doctor deep down but i also dont want to know if theres something wrong, I dont want to do the whole medication and therapy thing. I just want to be a normal kid who can be happy and out there like I used to be. Im sorry for talking so much but I just wanted to let it all out and ask if people think these are signs that I should seek help. Maybe if theres anybody going through something similar to me who has been diagnosed. Any sign to help me know whats wrong with me because I want to seek help but I dont want to tell my parents about it and have them tell me Im just going through the teenage stage of life, and then have a doctor tell me the same and make me look and feel even worse.",

    "is this a normal for parents to do? When i was like 1112 years old someone had done a poo in the toilet and left it and my Mum found it and both my brother and I said that we didnt do it. So my Mum made us both bend over in front of Dad and her and wiped our bums for us and then showed everyone the piece of toilet paper and whether it had shit on it or not. I remember her telling us to bend over more because she said she couldnt reach. My subconscious and conscious is telling me im a horrible person for saying this about my parents and that im just imagining it. But i know im not. Its killing me not being able to remember things from this event and from when my Mum left. The next parts foggy but i know that the first part above is definitely accurate I think my Mum wiped my bum and got shit on the paper and blamed it on me or something idk. And then i think my brother had shit on his paper as well. I think we were both ridiculed. I have many traumas involving my parents since then. Im now 18. And ive been in an emotionally incestuous relationship with my Father. My brother beats me. And my Mum doesnt do anything because she feels powerless because shes now a single mother my parents are separated I also reported my brother to the police last year for touching my boobs and beating me with a belt which my mum saw. But nothing happened and i dont think the police believed me because i was overweight. Anyway, whats everyone opinion on the poo wiping situation. Is that normal for parents to do?",

    "I think I’m helpless. I am a 19 year old female who has been struggling with depression since I was about 9 or 10. When I started college this past fall, I thought Id get a new start. It went well for the first couple of weeks, but as time went on, my depression took away my chance of making something out of my life. I missed two months of classes because getting out of bed physically made my limbs feel heavier and like I was going to faint. I got a 1.0 GPA last semester and have since then been placed on academic probation. I am taking one class this semester, online. I had a job for most of the school year, but my last day was a few days ago. I am now isolated from society into my room at my parents home with my fish. I try to see my friends, but theyre busy making something out of their lives. My only friend right now is my boyfriend. Con to that, we live in the same city, but he goes to a college two and a half hours away. I dont get to talk to him much since he works 25 hours a week and is also a full time student. I am going to therapy, and it helps a little. However, I am still stuck in my room most days wondering where I went wrong. I hate to just blab on about how hard my life is, but damn. I am stuck. I want to live to see the good days, but these bad days are swallowing me whole. I want to feel better. I want to be a better person. I feel like Im screaming and no one can hear me.

I dont know her exact severity but the college has her on a watchlist. She really wants to change but has trouble getting out of the mentality she has grown up with for so long. She has planned to take her life but from what I can gather she has postponed it. To quote her You referring me will never know Im gone if I did meaning she wouldnt tell anyone. At night when she is alone is when she feels the most depressed, to the point where sometimes she has become a nihilist and only wants her death. I understand that its all up to her to change and her suicidal tendencies dont mean she doesnt love me. Unfortunately due to our situations we became long distance partners. However, I have done what I think is good support. My questions that I have are What can I do to better support her? Is there some things that I need to say or do to better support her? Feel free to ask more to get a better gauge on the situation. Id appreciate if you guys want to discuss deeper into it though if we do, could it be through private messaging as I wouldnt want the comments to be filled with so much info. Thank you so much for listening. Any and all help is appreciated.",
    "I feel like I'm failing in life in itself and it's serious. I very always had a lazy streak but have worked years. I got laid off around a year ago. I guess Im depressed because I cant get back on track. Im very shy I dont like being around people even though I have been but now I liked it even less and Im not even looking for a job Im just living off what I saved for years. And I dont go out much actually Ive been like a hermit for almost a year so I was wondering if anybody actually was like this as well?",
    "Do people actually care? Sorry for the title, but it really is the best way to put it. Everyone says they care about me, want me to live, to message them if I ever feel like doing it. But Ive noticed a pattern, those same people talk about me behind my back, those same people often want me alive, but not necessarily around. My question is this, am I right to think that people as a whole are a lot more fake and cold than theyre willing to admit? Because I see a lot of words being said but Ive yet to meet someone who I actually believe cares. This post may seem self centered but I ask it out of frustration, I try my best to fight through it, for others. To be there for others. To care for others. Yet I struggle to find evidence of reciprocation besides empty words. The only reason Im alive today is because I promised I wouldnt hurt those around me by doing it, but Im feeling like they wouldnt actually care? And Id appreciate honest answers because I dont want to be alive for people who dont care anyways.",
    "How do I process a break up with depression and anxiety In April, I 25F blew up on my boyfriend 24M because his communication was extremely poor and he still had his dating apps. I kept mine to spy on him and until he finally deleted his. In November, he ghosted me because I blew up on him for being online on Badoo. we met on My trigger is rejection because I havent seen my father in 21 years. I get hysterical because I relive the abandonment and rejection over again I begged for him to come back and he did 3 weeks later. But, I always took the blame. He claimed that he used it to get weed. Fast forwards to April, the last time I saw him in person he got a notification from Bumble to come back and use the app. He told me he wasnt using it but I lost it and asked to see if he received a message but he wouldnt show me. Then, I asked him to delete all the apps on his phone. He claimed he couldnt get into Badoo because he needed to go through his email to get the password and it would take to long. Then, he didnt message me for over week, he does this all the time to me. He worked nights and it was a long distance relationship. All I wanted was how are you, good morning and good night text. I was always the one initiating the conversations. When i complained he would only communicate for 2 weeks and then stop. Also, he was never been there for me. After this point, I blew up, told him if he couldnt delete the rest of the dating apps and give me more communication or it was over. He never answered me back. Due to my depression trigger, I freaked out. I begged for him back again. He answered and was quiet again so I went to his house but never answered. After that, he stopped messaging me. Its been almost a month. I cannot sleep well even though Im on medication, I get panic attacks, have anxiety all the time about him replying back to me, being alone again, rejection and where my life is heading especially with this virus because I was suppose to move in with him.",
    "Life’s going downhill and everything that happens is mainly my fault My next issue is this incident that happened with my crush. Now Im assuming its normal to crush on people when youre 13, right? Well this one was my fault. I was texting my friend on discord, and we brought the topic up. We were just joking around, and then I said something, a little more... questionable. He laughed at it, and so did I, because say what you will about it, it was pretty funny. Were both in this discord server with a lot of people from our school in it, including my crush. However, one time when I was on the server, we were teasing each other. Normal, right? But then I got this dm saying shut up or Ill leak the photo or something around those lines. I was like um... okay because even though I knew what he did was technically black mail, I didnt want the photo to be leaked so I just shut up. This threat continued a couple more times until this happened. He didnt leak it to the chat, but he showed it to some of my friends. They were like bruh wtf and I explained the context of the image and how I didnt mean anything I actually said. But then he showed it to this one person, and it was this boy my crush is edating. I was on the server, when I got a dm from him saying Ill leak the photo to the server. When I pleaded him not to, he just said Yes and then sent the photo into the server, where everyone saw, including my crush his girlfriend. I was miserable. I left the server and went to bed, talking to myself about how I should just kill myself tonight well get to that soon and end it all. It was a while ago, and the drama seemed to die down, but I had to explain to my crush everything and she seemed to have forgiven me. However, people still bring it up and show the image, especially when my crush is still around. I beg to them not to as it obviously makes her uncomfortable but they wont stop, my sin wont leave me, no matter what I do.",
    "Losing a Dream I have always struggled with depression. I have constant feelings of not being good enough. Lack of self confidence. Life has been a rough road but its made me who I am. Recently I thought I found my soulmate. She made me feel a feeling I never felt in my life. She gave me so much needed self confidence and I gave it to her as well. Life was on the up. Things were complicated with current relationships but we knew it was going to be tough and I was willing to give her the world and totally shake mine up for it. At some point something changed. Extreme feelings of happiness to guilt, settling, lack of confidence in the situation and shutting it out. Now I am left feeling not good enough. I knew in the back of my mind I wasnt going to be but was always told otherwise. It felt like the most amazing dream. It was shattered. I dont know why but now I am left feeling a shell of what was being built up. I feel used and betrayed. It has been extremely hard to open up about the situation. I am very private and so is she. I just feel completely devastated and being now totally cut off from even a friendship I feel like someone died and its all my fault. I opened my heart and mind and they are left in tatters. I just dont know how to go on. Any words of advise or personal experience would be so so very grateful. I feel completely lost.",
    "I Don't know Why I keep feeling Sad! For the last 3 weeks Ive been feeling like shit! Initially I thought it was just a mood swing! But I continuously keep feeling bad! I keep remembering the times Ive been an ass to people and done stupid stuff and I constantly hate myself for it. In the last week Its become worse and Ive been crying multiple times a day. I dont have many friends and I am not getting any support. My dads an abusive and violent guy and doesnt treat my mom and brother well. I cant look to any of them for support as Ive always been disconnected from them. Only a few friends have been supportive by far the most has been ex girlfriend. I feel good when I talk to her but when the conversation ends Im swarmed by bad memories and simply break down. I feel like Ive been bad to her and dont deserve any support. It seems to come in attacks and I cant explain it, I am just continuously breaking down. Im not able to concentrate on my studies either and I have my university exams in a month. Idk what to do. There isnt even any therapist where I am at so idk what to do.",
    "Being laughed at The sound of my mom laughing cant exit my mind. I told her I wanted to learn psychology, yet she forced me to learn engineering. I barely survived math in high school. Man it sucks . I dont wanna fail her yet I dont wanna learn this subject. Even if she laughed at my dream , shes still my biological mom. She raised me . But.. I tried talking to her but it doesnt change anything. I love my mom. but Im not really cut out for math. Do anyone have any tips rather than talk to her slowly?",

    "Family crises She swears they didnt do anything sexual. Im kinda losing my shit right now..... Ive always been suicidal. My mom caught me in 5th grade trying to kill myself. I love my boys more than anything in the world, and I love her. Shes got an amazing family that supports her no matter what as the should. So she talked to her family about what happened and they all have her confidence. I dont have any family here, nowhere to go when things get rough. Shes just acting like nothing happened. Im extremely upset about it, she said they didnt do anything, but I cant stop thinking about her fucking some other guy in his boat. Before the Corona virus we went to 1 therapy session, and the woman diagnosed me with severe anxiety disorder, and that we need to get to the bottom of my problems so I could be a better man for her. We have a phone conference scheduled for Wednesday. I couldnt sleep last night, my heart has been beating out of my chest, I cant relax, and my breaths are short but frequent. So far its not let up, Im sitting in an empty church parking lot right now. I wanted to post this to get it off my chest and maybe give me relief? The feelings of suicide are very strong right now, but I could never do that to my boys. I have no where to turn, and I dont know what to do about it. All I can do is think of how much of a piece of shit I am to push her to this point which isnt helping my already venomous thoughts about myself..... I dont want a divorce, but Im so upset, I cant even look at her.....thanks for reading",
    "I give up. Nothing makes me happy. Im so tired. So so tired. The more I think about things, the more Im convinced that the only way to be happy right now is to pump myself up on drugs. Im a 20 year old mechanical engineering student starting his second year soon. I tried to kill myself twice over seeing my friends in better positions than me, and I dont think Ill be able to secure a job that gives me enough money to try all the things I want. Im not graduating from an Ivy League, Im not a doctor either, so I wont make enough to travel the world and do the stuff that Instagram and Reddit always puts on my feed. Even if I manage to win the lottery or something, I know nothing compares to the ideals that I make up in my head. Nothing on this earth looks fun or interesting anymore. I just wish I can jump into games or books and live my life there where anything is possible, but here, you dont expect aliens to take you to worlds beyond your imaginations, superpowers, or to save the world. The way I see it, Ill just be working my ass off with the occasional vacation until the day I decide to kill myself. Because of that, Im not motivated to try hard enough because I know everything is second best to my expectations. Whats the point of trying if you cant get what you truly want in the end, just a consolation prize? Its a vicious cycle, and I feel like a car running on an empty tank when Im not working for myself, but just for external reasons like not wanting to fucking starve when I graduate. Im ready to leave this fucking earth if I know nothing makes me happy anymore. Ive learned from my past two attempts, and I think the next one will finally work.",
    "A bit of a strange case: Exercise has DESTROYED my mental health. Thoughts? Advice? I feel like Im a prisoner in Guantanamo Bay, and frankly, Im surprised that more people havent killed themselves in that godforsaken place. I know, it sounds insane, but this is how I feel. Its gotten to the point where recently, Ive had anxiety attacks and suicidal thoughts. I dont want to live like this, I cant live like this. How come there are so many people who do intense workouts and dont experience these afflictions? Exercise is supposed to improve ones life, and indeed, thats exactly why I started exercising, but its having the OPPOSITE effect on me right now. I know that you guys will tell me to see a therapist or specialist of some sort, and trust me, I will be meeting with one soon, but in the shortterm, any advicehelp would be greatly appreciated. Thank you, and I hope that you are all having a good day and enjoying your life.",
    "Looking for advice to get through severe episode while waiting on meds trial to kick in Im currently waiting for my latest meds to hopefully kick in, but am suffering a lot in the meantime. Id love any suggestions for getting through the days. I have tried exercising, hobbies quilting, knitting, gardening, TV, getting out of the house, reading, pot, booze, etc. Nothing seems to help to rein in the increasinglyaggressive negative thoughts. Sometimes I just cry or stare out the window. Even petting or playing with my cats feels like stress. I try to nap it away, but I cant fall asleep during the day. Not currently actively suicidal, but lots of passive ideation that seems to be getting worse. I am a little desperate and welcome any ideas. Some background I am considered treatment resistant, have tried 2030 meds plus TMS, ketamine, mushrooms, and plenty of various therapy modalities. Nothing seems to stick for any period of time. Current med is Emsam 9 mg, an MAOI. Trying to give MAOIs a good chance before trying ECT.",
    "Do I have depression? Everyday I wake up with an unsettling feeling in my stomach, its such a challenge for me to get out of bed and get to school. I used to have a drive to do amazingly academically and become someone Ive always dreamed of.. But now I dont see the point. Every lunch time I just sit in the bathroom stall, each day feels so painfully long. I hate it. Most of my friends have betrayed me, so I dont enjoy hanging out with anyone at school. I dont want to talk to my school counseller about my problems, I have a fear of being judged by someone who doesnt know me, and I feel like my reasoning for skipping school is so invalid. My mum is so angry and thinks Im playing a game with her. She keeps telling me theres not long to go just keep pushing yourself, and I realise that but its still so hard for me to get up every morning.",
    "Help me, please. I have 0 friends in the literal sense. I have been living like this for more than 3 years I am putting aside every homework I have to write this. And just before you think anything else while reading this, I HAVE NEVER AND HOPEFULLY NEVER WILL THINK ABOUT COMMITTING SUICIDE, I FEAR DEATH. I also dont pretend anyone to completely read this, I just want to get this weight off somewhere and that this remains as a testimony for anyone who can identify with it and if you do read it you have my gratitude, its not much but its the most I can give right now. I am a 20 year old male currently in University studying what I like. Physically, I consider myself to be average, but sometimes I hate what I see in the mirror and sometimes I like what I see in it. Mirrors are a source of unhappiness for me and even if I try to escape my homes mirrors I will often open the camera app of my phone to look at me and take pictures of my face because I dont feel comfortable with what I see. I have hundreds of selfies just to look and to analyze my face and I always get angry if I dont like what I see. I dont know how much the last thing is related to the following thing, but I am a very timid, shy and silent person however I never have a frown in my face in public because I am always open to talk to anyone because I really need someone to talk to me I thank and appreciate virtual messages and conversations but I need a real life interaction. I feel guilty because sometimes I transmit this feeling of helplessness, sadness and misery to my dad and my brother and I know my dad thinks theres something wrong with me and I know he is shy to talk to me about it. I am in misery right now, the last real person who isnt from my family who I talked with was last September and I still cant consider him my friend because I know how real and genuine friendships feel like judging from my childhood good friendships, I miss those friendships but those persons are now far away, now have a life of their own with girlfriends and friends. I try to contact my first and old friends in Facebook and although they enthusiastically answer we can never get together, and even if we could I would be so embarassed to share with them what my life has become.",
    "I feel down for no reason at times, even while being with friends Sometimes Ill be doing good and having fun with friends and then I just start feeling sad. Theyll usually ask if Im good and stuff and I say things like yeah Im fine. I dont really believe myself, and I know they dont either at times. They tell me they are there to talk if I need, but since I feel depressed for no reason I dont know what I would say to them. I want to talk about it but all I know is that I randomly feel depressed for no reason, theres no big event or smaller event its just random. What are some things I could talk about? They want to help me and Id like to receive it, but what am I supposed to do? Just tell them I feel depressed for no reason at times?",
    "No One Cares So Why Should I? I am not great with conveying my thoughts but Ill try. I feel like no one cares whatsoever. All of my friends have others to hang out with, and honestly they probably enjoy each other more than being with me. On top of this, I dont really know how to tell people Im not doing well for a few reasons. I always seem to get short responses like itll get better or Oh and then its left at that. No one knows how to help me, which is fair I suppose, but after so many cries for help, Ive given up. No one knows how to help and surely it must upset or annoy them hearing about me having a bad time, so I decided to lie. I dont tell anyone how Im really feeling except on rare occasions. Even then, its not usually helped. Im so useless to everyone by being this way, so instead Id rather put on a mask and fake happiness, that way no one has to bother. I dont care about myself, I just want others to be happy and if that means ignorance then thats fine I suppose. I dont think anyone should do this, but I dont carry the same standards for myself as I do others. Im sure itll be bad but I just dont know what else I could do. I wish I could just be better but its impossible. Everything hurts in my heart so much that sometimes it makes me nauseous. I cant stand living around people who barely notice me. I allow myself to get used to make others happy. I hate it, but Ive decided its logical if it makes others happy. Instead of two people hurting, I just do, all the time. In this sense, Im like a doll. Im used for whatever purpose and then discarded afterwards. It hurts so bad, but I dont know anything else. Im worried about asking for help since I feel like I disappoint others when I cant tell them whats wrong, or if what they say or suggest doesnt help. I dont know what I need honestly. Sorry to be a bother.",
    "Got rejected from my desired program Hi, I was bullied and betrayed by probably all the people I thought I loved and was also living with my abusive dad when I was attending my last year of high school. This caused me to be severely depressed and suicidal during that year, but miraculously I still managed to get in to my dream school which happened to be UBC Canadian school. Anyways I was accepted into the Sauder School of Business in UBC and went there right after high school. However, that was the WORST decision of my life because I was still severely depressed and suicidal by the time university came around and scored the lowest marks of my life. Im talking about me being a 95 GPA student in high school going straight to a 55 GPA student in university, and also failed a science course my favorite subject btw. This happened because the whole first term, I stayed in bed so much resulting in missing class, barely showered, ate irregularly, and refused to hand in assignments just because I subconsciously wanted to selfsabotage myself or something. This really screwed my grades up, but thankfully I started seeing a psychologist and also got antidepressants and they helped me function normally after my first term in my first year. Ever since then, Ive tried my best to correct my mistakes and raise my GPA, been scoring mostly As and Bs I managed to get my GPA up to 75 but that first term just... drags me down still. I recently applied to change programs to science because I realized business is just NOT for me, and I want to do science... but I got rejected due to my failed course and my past 55 GPA for the first 5 courses I ever took in university. Im already one year behind because of my decision to change programs but now Ill be 2 years behind because of this rejection  I have to reapply for the next year . Im broke and poor and have to pay more debt the longer I stay in school  I dont even know if Ill be accepted next year when I reapply... Anyone have any advice for me? Im so lost... I feel like even when I function normally, depressed me from the past will always drag me down and bring me back to that state...",

Ive had depression for 6 years now and have been able to temporarily solve my problems but it would always come back worse, and i have no idea what has caused it this time, especially considering ive been on summer holidays which by a landslide my favourite part of the year. Im starting year 12 tommorow and am scared that not only because of all this im going to fail and waste my opportunities, but the extra load of 68 hours of school a day is just going to completely destroy me on top everything else happening.

    "Complete recovery after depression is a realistic expectation? Hey, before depression took over my life I23F used to be such a happy person  joyful, positive, hyped about all kinds of activities, passionate about life. Before finishing college I used to think that lack of time is my only problem, I had so many plans and wishes and I used to think that depression isnt a real thing, that some people just choose to be unhappy. And then it hit me  repressed childhood trauma, unhealthy relationships with my family members and too many disappointments in my love life gave me depression. At first I thought its only a bad phase and I was expecting it to end soon since I was about to start my summer vacations. I had planned a 2 weeks trip to Scotland and I was really hyped about it for like 6 months before leaving, but somehow I couldnt enjoy it, I only wanted to sleep and be alone and I was struggling to get through each day without being rude or visibly irritated by everything was going on around me. Thats when I realized that bad phase was a special one, but I only decided to get specialized help when I was already 4 months deep into it. At that point I was a mess, crying several times every day, spending all my free time sleeping, being terrified of my own thoughts, started thinking about suicide, pursuing a toxic online relationship, being unable to watch movies or reading books due to losing my ability to concentrate. At that moment, one of my best friends told me I was only a shadow of the person I used to be. The best feeling I was able to get about anything was this is almost acceptable. After my first visit to the psychiatrist I was put on medication and after only one month things became a little bit brighter for me  Christmas was coming and I started WANTING TO DO STUFF AWAKE!! I started watching netflix again, playing video games, hanging out with friends. I was still sad mostly, but I was able to enjoy these things from time to time which was nice. I also got fired right before Christmas for sleeping too much at work and doing almost nothing because of my depression, but I wasnt even mad about it.",
    "Do you fall out of love when you're depressed? Please. Anyone. My boyfriend and I had been together for 7 months. He first mentioned he was struggling in January with depression and needed to figure it out but had never felt that way before. We were still happy and talking all the time but I could feel him distancing himself still but he wasnt emotionally just physically. Then coronavirus hit... I saw him right before he went back to work in the beginning of it all, he had taken a vacation for 3 weeks when it was starting. After that last time I saw him, it wasnt for another week and a half until I saw him again and he was totally different. He was irritable, quiet, just NOT himself at all. During the time I didnt see him he hadnt seen his children either and it broke him. He broke up with me a week later when I saw he had basically broken down and mentioned he should get some help because he was different and suffering horribly. He said he needed to get better and it wouldnt be fair to me to wait. 2 weeks after ending things I asked if he still loved me and he said he didnt. He cut off all emotion from me. This whole time Id been trying to help him, was supportive, gave him sites to read up on it, got him to tell his mother, and also got him to reach out to a therapist through the fire department. My question is...did the depression make him stop loving me? Did he actually stop loving me or is it masked by his depression? Will he come back? Im drowning in despair and want the man of my dreams back. What do I do? Each time Ive seen him since that last day before he ended things he has been shutting off more and more...and eventually wouldnt see me anymore. Please someone help. I dont know what to do anymore for him. Or even know if he really just doesnt love me.",
    "I lost my job and potentially my career due to a deep depression. Hello, I 27F am using my alternative account because there are people who are trying to hurt me with anything they can find out about me. I was diagnosed with Anxiety, depression, and Bipolar disorder at the age of 11 and have always struggled, but I functioned for the most part. A little over a year ago, I was in the darkest place of my life. My dad had just had a major heart attackstrokeaneurism and was destined to die according to doctors he beat the odds with months of comastherapy. My favorite aunt had committed suicide and left my two high school aged cousins motherless. Most terribly though, my ex had blindsided me and illegally started a child custody battle to take my only child, a 7 year old, away from me who I have raised his whole life. I spent all my personal investmentssavings, 15,000, to hire a top attorney and was left broke and completely shattered. My partner was there to support me as much as he could so my son an i had a roof over our head but i was suffering. Shortly before this all happened, I had completed my 1 year internship at a major Financial Firm amp had gained my Series 7 amp Series 66 FINRA licenses. I was so proud of my accomplishments, salary, and stability after 10 years of customer service and sales jobs that did not provide full stability. I was so happy, the happiest I had been in a long time, and then everything came crashing down at the same time. I had an amazingly supportive boss who helped me every step of the way until I exhausted my PTO, UTO, FMLA, Short Term Personal Leave and he had run out of options to offer me. During all this time, I was nothing but a husk. I wouldnt leave my bed, eat, shower, and I spent hours just sleeping. My partner didnt know what to do and Psychiatrist were unavailable due to a large shortage in my city over 6 month waits and up to 9 months. I refused to go to an inpatient facility because I knew it would hurt my child custody case but at the time, that probably would have been the best option. This went on for over 3 months.",

If you stay to read everything, thank you, I appreciate it, because I really need it. So, I am almost 17 and I have depression since back in secondary school. I am always isolated by my colleagues, who only use me when they need to. Even so, I am always there for them although not the other way around. In my country being selfish is in power, but my parents raised me to be kind and modest so its pretty hard for me to find any friend. Besides that, my parents treat me very badly, always yelling at me or punishing me out of nothing, sometimes pretending I dont even exist. They dont believe me even if I tell the truth and dont ever encourage me. Because of that i became shy and introverted. The only friend I had , who started talking to me two years ago, becaming my bestfriend and also my first love later, changed completely when she got into highschool, got a boyfriend and threw me aside even if I told her about my depression and she knew I really needed her. Now I am alone and I got used to it, but I need someone be there for me and my loneliness only makes me feel more depressed. I always avoid going out with my parents because I feel like shit with them but I hate myself for it and their disappointed looks break my heart. The only way to escape from reality is my phone, but I started using it too often, watching night after night anime even if I have severe myopia. I constantly feel tired, I have no motivation to do anything, I dont seem to be able to love someone anymore and I really cant see myself in the future. The reason I write this is because today I had a nightmare with that girl and when I woke up my chest was hurting so bad and I screwed up with my parents. If anyone has come so far, thanks again, and sorry about my bad English. I really need some advice  What should i do? How can I escape this?",
    "First break up So ive scrolled on here for a bit and it seems like everyone is really nice... so here goes nothing This is my first break up but very weird ending. Ended with us both crying and and saying we loved eachother but the timing just wasnt right. He kept thinking about a toxic ex that he just couldnt get over even if in every way our relationship was healthier.his depression is a bit more severe than mine, but i would feed off his too0 much as well witch was bad too. I honestly dont know what im doing here....i guess i just want my story hear even though its rather insignificant and dumb haha. But i feel different now this is a different kinda of depression, i feel more just empty rather than hating myself or wanting to hurt myself. I dont really know how to cope with it. Like is this just how you feel after a break up and it passes or like do i just feel empty now...? Yes he was my first in practically everyhing we did over all but i cant help to feel it was all fake... he said he would think abouy her when we were together thats when i knew his depression was bad because he would just stop everything, caring, talking to me, all attention would stop it like would mental fuck me up. Like when he would do that it was a never endint cycle in my head like okay what wrong how do i help or just support,what if its me? Can i be nicer? Can i be sexier? And i ugly yo look at? Is he thinking of her? Etc. And it would every single time come down to him just randomly missing her. Like even right now it still fucks me up when did he think of her? When i was my happiest? Like it just all crumbles in to lies for me. Or im over thinking this whole thing and should stop thinging of it but its hard lol. I dont know maybe im in the wrong post but just advice, help on my depression how to cope with my body image cause i think im gross.i really dont know",
    "Trapped I feel like Im trapped in my own skin and I have no way out. The depression is starting to become too much and Im not sure if Ill ever be able to feel whole again. I lay awake at night, staring at the ceiling, crying because I feel so alone. I feel so alone, and yet connecting with people is so hard. I feel like Im just coasting through life and theres no way of becoming whole again. The crying and the negative thoughts are becoming too much. And Im not sure if theres ever a chance of me feeling anything other than this intense sadness.",
    "How do I stop being victimized? But then this happens i take this solutions but the regretted as i feel as a coward or a fool. It would ease my mind if I could find other cases or how to deal with this kind of situation where you feel helpless.",
    "I don’t know what’s going on I was always the guy that never thought he would get depression you know. Honestly me even saying that I have depression makes me feel like less of a man, it makes me feel like one of those emo and edgy kids from school pretending to be depressed and in their feelings. Everytime I felt sadness or lonely I just take a break and go to sleep or just get back on the grind and try to push through it. But I dont know, lately its gotten so much worse. Two weeks ago for a whole week straight I had insomnia, and Ive been feeling lost, unmotivated, frustrated, anxious with everything. My life is falling apart because Ive been being unmotivated to do anything. And back then If I ever felt unmotivated I always thought that it was just a lack of discipline to do the things I dream and strive for. But lately its been different. Ive been in my feelings every night, and I sleep for more than 10 Hours daily. Im always tired, I feel lethargic, unmotivated, and I need help. I looked up what the things Ive been feeling could mean, and the Internet keeps suggesting I have depression. But I dont feel overwhelmingly sad, I just feel overwhelmed, stressed out all the time, my body doesnt just want to do anything. My Mind just wants to take a day off. I just wanna give up on life. No I dont want to die, but I cant bring myself to try anything anymore. I want to make D1 Soccer in college, but I just dont feel like it anymore to practice and train and so I deteriorate in skill and fitness. I guess this is Karma because someone told me a while back they were feeling the things Im feeling now and I just told them to step up and be a man, and kind of just disregarded the Possibility of them actually being depressed. Even then, I used to have a friend who was depressed and I told her to just stop being depressed and own up to her actions and feelings, I told her it was just a lack of strength and that she just lacked discipline. But I guess now I understand. And I hate it.",
    "Is it normal for medication to make things worse before getting better? I started a new medication yesterday, Fluoxetine in liquid form to be consumed orally after breakfast, i was drawing as usual but suddenly i got memories of stressful moments of my life, which made me incredibly angry, i reached the desire of screaming and punching stuff, havent break anything thankfully. After 5 practice sketches i decided to call it out for the day, now im in the bed eating junk food out of depression. These things happened before, but this happened in such a unusual way, it normally happens after my ASSHOLE dad pisses me off. But this time it was the memory alone that triggered my anger, i dont know if the secondary effects are meant to happen in just the next day of starting the treatment. I know this isnt the place to ask about medicine but in case this is more in the psychological side then i need a new perspective on the matter.",
    "Don't know how to live Im only alive against my will. Im not a medical professional so Im not qualified to end my own life. My country and all other have banned my basic human right to die. Due to my rights being stripped i really dislike most people. As most people have contributed to the anti depressed moral grandstanding laws banning the basic human right to die. I have developedental health issues so i will never be able to support myself financially. I cant do the tings i used to due to physical limitations. I have no hope of any decent future. I have family and friends around me. Mom didnt abort me so she missed her opportunity to actually help. No way i could justify starting a relationship in my position. How do I exists in a life i dont want with nothing left to live for? If your just gonna give some bullshit answer on how life is worth living or how i should continue my suffering to keep my family happy Please dont bother. Its not wanted and Its definitely not about helping.",
    "Wife wants space to fight depression I have made the conscious decision to fight with every strand of my being to save this marriage and I will not be the one that ends it. Things have been fairly positive, we have met up at least once a week for walkscoming over for dinner etc etc. But its all very friendly, but I do say that I love her every now and then. She wants to take things one step at a time and she is open to marriage counselling, if the mental health counselling doesnt work out. I think deep down she still loves me even though she doesnt say it or that she misses me but does slip in the odd soppy nickname here and there. Might be just a habit, I dont know. She still clearly cares about me because the other day she barged into the house after my phone wasnt receiving sending calls or texts and I didnt let her know I was safe at home. She also does other things like picks things off me like the odd scab and blackhead here and there, cut my hair and hugs me in a meaningful manner. I feel like I may be rambling a bit here, I want to feel positive about things but I am really struggling. I am putting a brave face on for her so she has less pressure, but anytime we part ways I sob uncontrollably for hours because i just love her so much and want her to come home. Has anyone else gone through something similar with their spouse? Any tips? Ive been extremely self critical and I can see there are improvements I can make to make the relationship better. Especially now we have more financial freedom. But with lockdown still in force, it makes things 10x more difficult. TLDR My wife wants space to find out what she wants. She says Ive done nothing wrong. We still talk and meet up. Marriage counselling after her individual counselling. Im hurting and want neutral advice.",
    "My depressed partner drains me So here is the thing. I know hes depressed and I know that he is busy with surviving day to day. But Im pissed. I sometimes get so angry and frustrated with him. He doesnt go to therapy and I dont know, if he really tried to get a therapist but the waiting lists are too long or if he didnt try hard enough. He wont tell me. Same thing with his job situation. I dont know, if he is searching and for what. Everytime I ask him, what he wants to be or do he tells me, he doesnt know. And I started asking him really deconstructed questions like what kind of activities writing textsorganizing eventsmaking statistic sheetsetc do you like? do you want to work alone or in a team? what goals helping people and what kind of peopleincomeetc do you want to be met? and so on. Its always I dont know. I am getting really impatient. Its been six years and he has so much potential that he doesnt see or use. Everytime I suggest something, he doesnt use that info, but feels stupid, becaus he didnt have the idea himself. Doesnt matter that I keep reassuring him that it is okay, to need help or not know everything on the spot. He feels stupid and blocks any further conversation and than i find myself trying to calm him down and in the end he promises me to change things, but never does. Probably because he really doesnt have the energy, I get that on an intellectual level. I understand it. I still feel extremely frustrated. This whole situation keeps our life on hold. It didnt matter to me for a long time. I always told myself, that he will find his way and that he will figure everything out, but now we are in our thirties and I really want to start a family. I want to get married and have children and start the next chapter. I cant do that with a man who barely survives. And it starts to severely affect me.",

I only have 1 friend and she is also depressed ik i should surround myself with positive people but idk i just dont We got high a couple months ago and i noticed some cuts on her hand i was stoned so i couldnt really process what i saw and basically forgot about it. About 3 hours after when the effects had calmed down, i remembered that i saw the cuts and asked her about it and she denied it at first but she eventually showed them to me and i asked her why she did it and she told me that she doesnt even know why, she said its stupid and it does nothing for her but she does it anyway. Fast forward to present day, the cuts are now on her wrists not super deep she does it with a box cutter and i have basically begged her not too. She has stopped doing it for about a couple weeks now because she has a job and it requires her to wear a tshirt and she does not want people to notice.

I am clean of it now and I have a loving boyfriend 18M, for the past one year and he knows about it. Both of us are in pain because of this. The dude has been texting me for the past one year repeatedly making me satisfy his needs. If I block him he creates other accounts. Ive already gone through physical sexual abuse when I was a child.

    "Where to go and how to get diagnosed. For years Ive gone through what I self diagnosed as episodes of depression. They usually last about a month or two of being super down and not having any drive to do anything at all. Im 21 now and it has been this way since 15 years old. When I was 17 I told my mom I was depressed and I told my guidance counselor in high school. Nothing came out of that except they sent me to a doctor to get blood drawn for some reason and I was sent on my way because the counselor said maybe I have a thyroid issue. Terrible counselor and terrible doctor. Never went back. Not blaming my mom either I just think she doesnt really understand what Im saying I feel. Ive talked to her about it a lot and she usually just tries to support me and tell me things will get better or youre just in a rut right now. Which can sometimes piss me off. But she is in no way doubting me or anything like that. She even told me to go see a therapist or doctor. But I dont know where to go or even how. Who do I go see to get a diagnosis? I dont want to be brushed off again. Instead of trying to self analyze my problems and try to treat them my own ways Id like to finally get closure and see if I really am depressed, or something else, or just dramatic.",
    "I am really struggling with people touching me Ive been having a pretty rough two or three months. This means even that I feel uncomfortable having my boyfriend touching me. I have talked to him about this twice how Ive been growing distant and disliking anything to do with touching he is a person who loves touch. It seems like even though Ive told him how bad it feels having someone touching me, he keeps doing it and it is starting to suffocate me. He is always asking why I dont touch him and stopping me to hug me or touch me in some way. This is making me quite irritable as well. I am waiting to get help from a doctor and see what I can do about it, but can you guys give me some advice on this? How can I get myself to not feel this way? Ive been forcing myself to take it for a while now and it just gets worse?",
    "I'm struggling Ive always struggled with depression. It went away when I met my partner. I thought I had everything figured out. Then he told me he might want an open relationship one day and now, my trust, my faith, my sense of self and who i am and what I want out of life is broken, its gone. I cant trust anyone anymore. Im just an empty body, waiting to die at this point. I feel like everyone is the world is like him. I feel alone in my wanting to have 1 partner for the rest of my life. I feel alone in the dedication and commitment I have to wanting to make a relationship work. I sabotage all my female friends because I have developed an aversion to women because in my brain I am convinced they will all try to have sex with my boyfriend. I will find something, anything, to validate my beliefs and it spirals out of control, I cant figure out whats real and whats not. I cant figure out when my brain has made something up it never feels made up! It always feels real. I feel, like whats the point of a relationship if it might just end one day. I cant imagine being alone. I dont want to be alone. I know its unhealthy. I understand this. I understand that I have a problem. But, its not going to just simply go away. Its not that I am not capable of making it go away. Im sure I could try. Its that I do not want to let go of my dreams. I dont want to live another way, but I feel alone. It doesnt help that I am an atheist and it feels like my values are not common amongst atheists. Life sucks.",

Ive dated her for years this isnt the first depressive episode last time I did leave since she was already moving on with someone else. But this time there is no one else we were talking about marriage before she went into this depressive state.

    "Depressed International Student; need help I start working on something and feel it is totally pointless. I start watching youtube or the office to feel a bit better and suddenly it is 6 pm. I think that its already evening, maybe I should go out, get some fresh air. I go out, pickup a friend and smoke a cigarette or two my friend doesnt smoke. While coming back, I feel the day is almost over and I am basically useless, nothing will change if I get high. I go and buy some marijuana edible legal, eat it and go back home. I act like I am working while staying high, so my parents wont know. Many times, I just lie that I have a meeting and shut off my door, lie down and masturbate like twice or thrice in a day. As I get high, I also overeat and buy a lot of junk food and chocolates. Then, I spent the rest of the night till 23 am doing all this and watching office or Youtube. I feel totally exhausted and go to sleep. Then, I wake up next day exhausted at 10 and the cycle goes on. I also feel pretty dumb as I have almost no progress on my thesis. My professor thinks that I am smart but I am not. I just slack and slack and come up with some excuse for not doing the work. I just make some dumb and vague presentations an hour before the meeting. From last two weeks, I havent even done that. I just make some excuse and try to portray myself as the victim. I have one more semester left for my thesis and I think I should just quit. But I cant because then how will I pay for my loan. I am also not getting any internships, how the fuck am I supposed to get a job. I thought maybe Ill start a PhD degree as I am not really getting anything else and Ill at least get some stipend regularly if I get the scholarship. My chances of getting the scholarship are highly dependent on my honours thesis and I seem to be doing a very bad job till now. I have to submit a draft of a literature review on Monday rn its Saturday night which will be of around 15 pages and I havent even started yet.",
    "I don’t want to feel depressed anymore Ive been depressed for 8 years now, and long story short its really been getting the best of me these past 3 months. I dont know why its all crashing down now. Im tired of feeling like this, I say I want to die but in reality I just want to escape. I finally want to be better. I just dont know how. Therapy doesnt seem to help, and Im willing to try anything to feel better. Every time I get to a good place mentally, something happens and Im back to square one. Im a mess I guess and just need help to get beyond this",
    "Nothing helps. No matter what I do. My depression consists of lack of interest in all of the hobbies I have, disassociation from friends and family and not caring about them, mental fog that causes me to make mistakes at work which Im then yelled at for, fear of death and meaninglessness that takes over me, and feeling worthless and incompetent at life. It doesnt matter that I eat clean, exercise regularly, write my thoughts down, meditate, force myself to practice my hobbies, go to work nearly full time, take classes, keep my car and living space clean, force myself to socialize, or try to be what is generally accepted as a good person. Life is fucking miserable. I cant make sense of anything. If I try to make a point, an argument shuts it down. Then I question my view, change it or adapt it, then argue that point, then it gets shut down. Its as if there is no truth in the world at all and nothing is real. Its so goddamn frustrating it makes me break down. And then I think about how Ill never be like a normal person who can just be themselves and move on with their lives. I feel guilty for everything I do that I cant prove is the right thing. I just want to die all of the time and I even think about it in the middle of working or playing music, even during these intense moments where I should be focused I can only long for death and a cessation to the pain. Im also in physical pain from multiple injuries that are long term and past drug abuse which Im sure fucked my body up. Im too afraid to actually kill myself because I know Ill just go into a void and my go clings onto life selfishly. I probably dont deserve to live though I make sure to tell myself I do. It doesnt help. I just want one thing to make sense in life, but everything is so confusing and Im no good at any of it. Ill start my semesters of college with straight As, keep them till 23rds of the way through, then lose focus and end up with Cs or D and have to retake some classes.",
    "Venlafaxine Withdrawal - Can’t tell my boyfriend My bf does not know the extent of my depression and I suspect he does not understand it.

Yet Ive never gone far to act on my suicidal thoughts and I know I dont harm myself. But Im tired of living this way. Tired of struggling with major Depression, anhedonia, anxiety and chronic headachesmuscle tension. Sometimes I think, if I have no fear of death then why dont I just do something crazy with my life and just go for my dreams and just push myself to exercise more. But I dont even know what my dreams are now. I dont know what I like anymore and its hard to enjoy things. I just watch shows or try to take walks and keep avoiding my responsibilities.

But I just dont feel connected with people as much even tho I have some friends that have been checking up on me... I just dont feel close to them. I dont feel good or necessarily sad, just mostly apathy and emptiness. I dunno what to do with myself. I found purpose before but then I lost it when I became depressed again.

    "feeling kind of depressed (cycle) for a while 18 year old here. One day I kind of realized there was an ugly aspect of my face deep set eyes with some hyperpigmentation. I learnt thats a thing seen mostly in people of color amp has to do with facial structure or something like that. I think I had a panic attack because I was crying about it for a while and then became normal again. But the next day around the same time the same thing happened..then I was happy again Im of course one of many people who dont really call themselves pretty and never really considered it. But right now Im thinking maybe if I get therapy and stay there for as long as possible, Ill feel somewhat better or calm. I wont fall back into the cycle of feeling depressed about it, it was kind of traumatic. Dont really think its Body dysmorphia, or could it be? I dont really care about looks too much. But I hate seeing my face most of the time. Ive even been listening tousing affirmations amp frequencies on YouTube recently to change that ugly aspect so I can just look pretty ok. In other words it just sucks. I guess for some people many people obviously genes didnt work out so well. Wish I looked better. Then I would be carefree and not worry about this. Dont even know what I really am actually. Should people like me just give up..maybe not because I do have other interests which at least are entertaining. I like drawing, making edits amp watching videos, etc. I think Im falling into that depressive cycle again and I just want it to end. But I dont know how.

And the best part is that i cannot get help , i dont want to speak to my mother and solve the problem , i keep everything inside me.

One example of this was how I couldnt even be happy for my friend whos talking to a girl right now, like Im unbelievably upset at myself that I cant even be happy for my own friend.",
    "How do I stop the fear of getting too attached to people? Hi everyone, A bit brave for posting this on my main, but here it goes. My attachment to people is a big issue. It has definitely led to heart ache, sadness, and disappointment. So  I got this great job a couple of months ago, every day was a challenge and something new. My colleagues are great people  I genuinely love speaking to them, and just overall having a good time. But  I have an issue of getting too attached to people and not interpreting signals correctly. This eventually leads to the other party to not dealing with me anymore I dont really blame them to be honest and just... cutting me off. This has eventually developed into me not opening up  or being personable with people as I am simply too scared of this attachment growing. Sometimes they message me out of work We all have each other on social media, big mistake on my end! and I just leave on seen or reply blandly, or sometimes in the middle of a conversation I just never reply, simply because I feel like this will go down the same road as before, just being too attached. Every day I struggle keeping myself composed I take photos just to get my head off things, this is the only thing that gets me going through the weekend. Should I tell this to my colleagues? Should I keep it a secret? I really dont know. At the end Im just not happy with how I am. I get suicidal ideations every single night and just remembering the relationshipsfriendships that I have fucked up literally gives me anxiety and it has definitely caused some sort of trauma. I dont go through with suicide because I just think of my parents on how sad they will be. But  once my parents pass away I am planning to fully commit as I really dont want to live this crippling anxiety with every single relationshipfriendship.",
    "Feeling Super Stuck - Would Love Some Advice I grew up in an abusive home, and was abused basically daily from about the age of four until I left at 16. Turns out that the only other abusive relationship Ive ever been in is with the person Im currently married to. There was never physical abuse in my marriage, and my childhood trauma definitely factors in here. I could go on for pages describing the history and the current dynamics, but Ill keep to the point by saying that Ive made huge strides in understanding my mental health, that I know myself quite well, and that the chances of me being happy and fulfilled in the marriage are zero. Theres been a mountain of therapy, tonnes of conversations, over several years. Ive been the this is fine meme for about four years now and I just cant do it any more. If it wasnt for our daughter, I would have broken up long ago. Ive stayed because of her, and Ive done my best to make the relationship work. Its clearly not working though, and Im feeling painfully stuck and Im miserable. I have every reason in the universe to leave except for one reason, and shes an amazing little human that I cant imagine abandoning. So yeah, I have no frigging idea what to do. Staying in this relationship is a terrible option. I cant afford to live in Houston without a job. Working remotely for a company in Canada is an option, but most pay terribly and I havent had any luck landing one yet. Homelessness is technically an option, but not really. I could go back to my old job in Canada any time, but thats a 23 hour drive away not counting traffic and bathroom breaks. I dont have anyone in my life I can talk to about this, so Im hoping for a little bit of emotional support here. This situation has me feeling unresolvable stuck, and for the first time in my life at times Im feeling desperate and miserable. I know the right thing is to find a way through it with my wife for the sake of my daughter, but honestly I dont think my soul can take it. Any suggestions?",
    "No matter what I think I feel like I can't stop myself from suicide Ive spent so much time thinking about killing myself, even had dreams where I have put a gun to my head and pulled the trigger. Just every time Im thinking I drift towards thoughts of suicide. I just dont see the purpose in anything at all. Every time I try to think myself out of it I just fall back into thoughts of suicide again. Like the finishing thought behind all my thoughts is suicide and nothing else matters. I just feel like unless I kill myself Ill just be here waiting to kill myself until I finally do it. At this point Im not even sad anymore, Im just THAT tired of being alive. I have nothing to gain from continuing to live, Id rather just be at eternal peace after death over each day being wasted time after time after time again. I dont know what to do. Love is the only thing that I could imagine that could pull me away from these thoughts but then theres nobody who loves me, or understands me or wants to spend each day together. So Im just left lonely and at that Id rather have been dead.",
    "Could someone offer some advice on how to be a functioning adult? Ive been depressed my entire life. Because of this, Ive spent all of my time doing what was required of me such as homework, taking care of basic needs such as eating or sleeping, and mindlessly refreshing social media or the news. I have no hobbies or interests or skills or ability to take care of my mental wellness. I can probably survive on a physical level I know how to work, how to pay taxes, how to pay bills, how to get in contact with someone to rent an apartment, that sort of thing. But I have no idea how to stop being so miserable all of the time. I cant keep a job without feeling suicidal almost every day because I need to work although I force myself to keep one anyways, I cant pick a future career path, I cant motivate myself to pursue hobbies, I cant even do things that make me feel happy because nothing really does as far as I know. What Im asking is how do I stop just surviving and start living? How do I fit a fulfilling life around all of this stress and overwhelming deadlines and responsibilities? How do I actually be an adult? I can do the basic things I need to in order to keep my physical body alive, but I have no idea how to do anything beyond that. Thank you guys for your help, and I hope something great happens to you today like finding an unexpected 20 in your pocket.",

    "I don’t know how to help my depressed friend. Hello everyone, Ive come here for help or advice on what to do for one of my good friends. This might be long because theres a lot to unpack here. She19 has dealt with depression ever since middle school. I didnt know her at that time, only the past couple years and this year has she started opening up to me. She comes from a family that is overly strictly Christian. Both of her parents dont really believe in mental illnessmental help and her mother constantly gaslights her saying her depression isnt real and gets told to just suck it up or that she doesnt have anything to be depressed over. She tells me all the time about how shes tired, feeling sick constantly, body aches, has zero energy all of the time. It doesnt help that she works 40hweek. Ive been pushing seeing a psychiatrist or counselortherapist, and she wants too, but she also suffers from severe anxiety and absolutely despises the thought of hiding something like that from her parents because even just thinking about it sends her into a anxiety attack of sorts. Recently though, I feel like its gotten worse. Whats even worse is that Im the only person she talks to about this sort of thing, or I guess the only person she really talks too often in general, but recently shes started to push me awaydistance herself. I dont know if she means too, or if shes doing it purposely, but I dont know what to do. This scares me. Im trying to be there as much as I can but its starting to become difficult. This breaks my heart and I dont know what to do. Thanks for taking the time to read this. Ill answer any questions best I can.",

I tried looking through the other rooms therapy 13, advice 12, etc. and it also didnt seem to be really on topic. I tried to do the 11 support and there was someone who answered but after I shared, I no longer got a response not sure if they got busy, missed my message, or something else.

    "Weed and depression I started smoking marijuana at the age of 15 at first it seemed like the best thing in the world, but as time went on, my anxiety started to dominate in my life, causing me today to have depression. Nowadays I cant stop smoking marijuana because my friends are always smoking and it is inevitable not to smoke, every time I smoke I feel like its a bad trip I get stuck in my thoughts, judging myself, creating impossible situations to happen and I cant get out. last week i was having suicidal thoughts worst of all i dont want to kill myself but i cant stand the suffering anymore and every time i smoke i feel those same thoughts, im afraid ill never be able to smoke marijuana again since I miss the trips that I had in the beginning.

    "My ex husband dead because of me and I hate living I married my ex husband when I was 18. We had 2 kids together. I already had 2. There was ups and downs. Good times and bad ones but something that stayed constant was he wouldnt work. I went to nursing school with the promise he would take care of the home. This didnt happen. After 7 years of this and also quite a bit of mental abuse I divorced him. The kids started getting into trouble and were so upset. Plus to be honest I missed him. I went back. I did this for 8 more years. Meanwhile he had developed quite the tab habit. And me overdrawn everyday day trying to feed habits and kids. I didnt leave again til it got so bad he was needing stronger and stronger things and me and the 2 girls left at home had no running water or lights. It was hard without family. He begged and begged me to come back. Just like last time. He also played bad guy and even tried to get me fired. He died less then a year after we left. He was in a crack house. High on heroin and fentanol. His kids devastated. So now here am i.. with all the things ppl know I went through. And I have to be strong for the kids. But there was some good times too. Some only him and I shared. He understood me like no one else. He wasnt always a drug addict. Maybe I actually hoped subconsciously that he would get better and we could try again. After all I had never cared about anyone like I do him. All I know is I miss him so fucking much! I cry every day. I dont wanna live without him. Everything and I mean everything makes me think of him.. and Im so lost. I cant believe he left me. He left me here without him and it hurts so damn bad and I dont know how to make it stop. I just want him.... and all this im feeling roaring in me like a fire.",
    "Is it just me or does depression sometimes come and go? I 16M have been struggling with depression for quite awhile now and Ive wanted to know does it usually come in waves? For me I can stay happy for a period of time with little to no suicidal thoughts before suddenly slipping back into a pretty horrible state of depression. I feel like theres some triggers but they dont exactly cause the full blown depression state but maybe my overthinking pushes me into a bowl of shit and I was wondering maybe whether it was just for me or maybe its for other people struggling with depression.",

He doesnt have a father because he unfortunately passed away a long time ago and Ive been the only one raising him. Recently hes been putting his hands on my breasts during the day.

    "I just someone to hold me. I don’t know anymore. Its been a month since my partner of 10 years left me out of no where on my birthday. Just had their bags packed and said Im leaving. I have no closure and still dont even know what happened. She was physically and emotionally abusive to me but never told anyone about it on account of how emasculating it feels. I dont know how you tell people your female partner punches you at home during arguments. She begged me to go to therapy for years and started to with covid, I worked so hard to become a better person and mentally healthy and she hated that version of me. Now Im a waste of life in their 30s with no reason to live. She took all my friends with her and I just dont have anyone anymore. I drove cross country to be with family to try to sort myself out, but was quickly reminded why I dont spend much time with my family as its only made my mental health worse. I was happier alone with my dog in my car with no where to go or anything. Ive stopped taking my medication and have been drinking heavily, which I hadnt done for a year really. I took my last Ativan today and its been the only thing keeping me from going off the deep end. I doubt my psychiatrist will prescribe more so it just seems like the end to me. I think for some people suicide is their lifes purpose and I feel like I am finally becoming content with that. But I cant even talk like this openly with my therapist or psychiatrist out of fear of just being committed. I know my self and know I will just lie to get out of there too and will only drive me further to killing myself. I just dont understand why people I thought loved me want to hurt me so badly. I guess I just have bad karma and have done something to deserve this so I feel like nature is just telling me its time to die. I dont expect any one to respond or even read this. I just have no one.",

Often I starve just because food is so unappetizing. But I have to eat, especially at work because I become emotional and cry in front of clients. To complicate matters, I just dont have much energy to expend in making a complex meal or the know how to do it. Any recommendations for something I can take to eat at work?

    "To medicate or not.. About 2.5 years ago I was diagnosed with depression  anxiety no biggie. It runs in the family, its a biological depression as one side of the family doesnt produce enough serotonin, so nothing actually happened to me to set it off. But it affected a lot of things that I wanted control over, I wasnt living my best life. I went on medication Venlafaxineffexor, and it helped dramatically. Though I gained 15kgs in the 6 months. So I came off. Ive been good for 2 years, I got the weight back down, and Im hovering between average and athletic. But recent changes in my life have stirred the pot. Mirtazapine is a recommendation that should work differently and not cause the weight gain. I dont want to go on the meds again if Im going to gain that weight back so fast. I dont want to be on meds my whole life like my family members. But nor do I want to stay like I am currently. So how do I decide? Flip a coin? My psychologist and psychiatrist havent been able to help me make my mind up. Anybody been on mirtazapine? Does it cause weight gain and kill libido? Not that I have a libido at the moment anyway, thanks life",
    "We were engaged. He left me for a 19 year old he has been talking to online for the past 3 months When he woke up, he sent me a long message apologizing, saying how bad he felt and begged for my forgiveness. Yes I know, Im stupid, but I was going to forgive him. He was telling me that anything I wanted him to do to gain my trust back, to let him know. I told him to block her in all social medias. He did. He sent me screenshots of everything. The long call happened from a Friday night through a Saturday morning. His regret and attempt to try gaining my trust back only lasted until Sunday. These two days he spent apologizing and telling me how he wanted to grow old with me, that kind of stuff. Well, like all this didnt seem bad enough, the worst part of the story comes now. On Monday morning, I was at the gym, and I got a message from him. The way he wrote seemed odd, so I asked if something was wrong and he said he didnt feel good. I immediately left the gym and told him to give me a few minutes, that I would get home and we could call. As soon as I got home, I didnt even shower or anything, I just went to my room and called him. Then he just finished shattering my heart. He said he needed to be honest with me. He said that from the very first time we met in person, when I went there, he felt something wasnt right between us. That he didnt feel a connection. He said kissing and other intimate moments felt weird. He said he only proceeded with everything, asked me to marry him, started my Visa process and everything because he was scared of being alone. Since he never had another relationship before and I was the first one that ever got interested in him, he felt like he had to do everything he could to keep me in his life, so he wouldnt end up alone. Now that he had found this other girl, he felt he really connected with someone.",

Weve known each other for 12 years and now were both in the same university. He has panic attacks and a very unbalanced cycle. Im spending most of my time with him, cooking for him, holding him through his attacks and trying to take care of him in general. Problem is that Im struggling with my emotions.

    "I don’t know what is happening First of all, hello everyone and thank you for taking the time to read this. Ive been dealing with a lot of stuff recently and I think Ive done pretty good in regards how to deal with it but I still need some additional inspiration andor advice or you know, just someone who will listen because my friends have been listening to this a lot and I dont want to burden them with this any further. I was dating a guy from January until pretty recently and we were always on the brink of getting serious when he decided to distance himself from me because I think he was scared or something I dont blame him then in may I found out that I was pregnant 4w  3 d when I found out and I told him. He got extremely angry when I told him and that resulted in us having this really bad argument over if I should keep the baby or not and I was not budging because I thought it was in my best interest to keep the baby but then one thing led to another and I had a miscarriage the same day as I told him about the pregnancy and he seemed relieved that I had the miscarriage. But then yesterday I told him that I had to stop seeing him because I met a guy who treats me better and what not I hadnt talked to the guy I had been seeing for a few weeks so I assumed that it was over and he decides to tell me that he loves me he worded it like this even though its not in that way I love you and really care about you and I told him that I love him as a friend and that I really care about him too, later on he proceeded to tell me that he regrets how he acted towards me when I was pregnant and he now sees that we could have coparented well and that he wishes things wouldnt have happened like they did. I dont know how to feel about this because when he brought up the miscarriage I started to feel like I did when it happened because I still want that baby even though its gone and I know I can never get it back. Is it weird that I still want to be pregnant and is it weird that this chat of ours brought back the feelings that I had previously suppressed towards him?",

    "Should I get myself checked in to a psychiatric ward so they can force me to start my antidepressant? I have anti nausea medication, and I can take that while starting. This option has upsides and downsides too. First of all if I ask them for anti anxiety medication Im guaranteed to be seen as a drug seeking patient. They did that before and I dont even have any drug abuse history. Even if I get them I might not have the willpower to start them. I might end up getting an anxiety attack even if I take anti anxiety medication. Okay here is the part where Im talking about stuff I dont really know much about. The anti nausea medication I have is Zofran. From what I understand the reason antidepressants cause nausea is because they increase the levels of serotonin in the brain and the digestive system. As a result of that the increased levels of serotonin agonizes the 5HT3 receptors and this causes nauseavomiting. With repeated use the 5HT3 receptors become downregulateddesensitized and because of that nauseavomiting stops. Now if I were to take Zofran it will prevent me from getting nauseous because it will prevent serotonin from agonizing the 5HT3 receptors, since its a 5HT3 antagonist. But that means it will also prevent 5HT3 receptors from downregulateddesensitized, because they arent being excessively agonized, and when I stop taking Zofran I will become nauseous or I will vomit, and that defeats the whole purpose of taking Zofran. I dont want to take Zofran continuously because it comes with its own side effects. End of the part where Im talking about stuff that I shouldnt be talking about. So now the upsides of the second option. I wont have to deal with the psych ward. Considering the healthcare system in my country, I have good reasons to believe that the care they provide at the ward is not good enough. I wont have to do a lot of explaining to my parents. I wont have to risk abuse and stuff like that. The revolving door syndrome appears to be very prevalent with the mental health facilities in my country.",
    "I can't open up to anyone I just dont have anyone to open up to. Ive never been close to my sister, and my dad hates me. the only person in my close family I could talk to is my mum, and I dont want to tell her just how bad I feel all the time, because she gets really stressed about everything, and I dont wanna hurt her. Im not nearly close enough to any of my friends to talk to them about how i feel. I keep posting online, reaching out because i need to feel like somebody cares. and as supportive as everyone has been every single time, I need a shoulder to cry on. I need a hug more than anything in the world, and I cant have it.",
    "I think I’m slipping into insanity Hey all, need a bit if supportadvice As of recently, Ive noticed Ive been having a lot more breakdowns than I usually have. These have gotten to the point where Ive begun to push the important people out of my life. On the flip side, I dont do anything with my life. Besides the global quarantine we currently have due to COVID, I just.... do nothing. I feel bad because I have no job, so Im constantly asking for money from my parents, which I then spend like a madman, and, again, I just sit at home and play video games all day, despite telling myself to do other things. This, along with recent events, has left me highly aggressiveabrasive. Thing is, I recognize that this is not me, and Im basically trapped under impulse. What can I do? Is this Psych Ward or MRIworthy? Does anyone know of ways I can get help online or through an app?",
    "I need help to help a friend... Which pretty much dug him even further into the hole he is in, I cant help but want to do something, I wont be telling his parents more because I am afraid that he will be punished for speaking his problems out loud, which is wrong, but keeping in mind his parents, not surprising, anything I can do for him?!? I really quite do need this help as I have never been... sad... Ive never felt actual sadness... Ive felt defeat, anger, pitty, but not sad. Ive never felt... deppressed, or done, so I have no idea what its like and how to solve it... any help would be great . thank you in advance lt3",
    "Effects of anti depressants So I just started anti depressants this last week and I wanted some input from people that are also on them. I dont know if I feel okay or if Im numbing down. And I dont know if that numbing is a part of the medication, or if I should ask for it to change? I dont get excited, but I dont get severely depressed anymore, and my anxiety is just a series of belly aches now. Do I have to trade betting emotionally free for stability? Or are there other options? Medication is lamotrigine, 25mg. 1dose every day at the moment, soon apparently to be upped to 50mg a day. Tldr numb from meds normal? Or should I try something else",

Note, I cannot afford hospitalization. 1. 5 therapists talk therapists 2. 2 nurse practitionersprescribers 3. 1 failed treatment program 4. 2 school ceoncelors 5. Talking to my friends 6. Talking to my parents 7. 5 different psychiatric medications SSRIS, Mood Stablizers, anxiety meds 8. ReligionFaith didnt work 9.

I still am extremely afraid of any feedback, even good feedback. I am so, so tired of trying. Ive tried so much. I just want to stop. I always tell myself this, that its all not worth it.

    "Women of Reddit: Does your period make you feel suicidal? Every time Im on my period my depression gets worse. I cant bring myself to do anything and my tears wont stop falling. I feel sad over the smallest things and get super exhausted. I think its time to end my life. Like the urge becomes strong and then I start thinking of ways and then I fall asleep. I dont want to go on like this forever. Life is the worst fucking thing to have happened to me and I want nothing to do with it. Im actually the weakest person Ive met. And I just realized that it gets worse during my period.",
    "I have no one else to talk to Their problems are so much bigger than mine. I usually snag the bathroom for extended periods of time because its the only place I can cry in private. So... I spend a lot of time in the bathroom. I feel like a failure all the time. I couldnt give my partner a house or a honeymoon. I cant afford to get her the treatment she needs and I certainly dont consider getting any for myself because I feel like I can still function on the bare minimum. I cant work two jobs like I used to because my physical health has started taking a nosedive. I know that things could be so much worse for us. Its not like Im ungrateful but I just feel so bad all the time. Im constantly feeling like everyone hates me and sees me as a burden. I feel like I have nothing to show for all the work I do and I cant stop working because we cant afford it. Im lucky to be working from home for now but we return to the office soon. Now being around people in a small room terrifies me because of covid. If I get sick, everything will fall apart for my family. Im so, so very tired. And in mental agony. All the fucking time. I cant afford therapy, i dont even know where to start in finding outside support. Not even sure why Im posting here... I just needed someone to know this. Its not like I want to kill myself or anything, I have too many people depending on me, but sometimes I wish I could go to bed and just not wake up. Everything hurts. All the time.

    "I don't know what to do at this point other than end it. Nothing has helped so far. Just blamed me. I live with constant guilt. Whenever I make a mistake, I hurt myself. Consciously or not. I have scars up and down my arms and all over my fingers from stresspicking, and my shoulders and thighs and stomach are covered in selfharm scars. It does not matter if its a big mistake or a small mistake. I cannot deal with the guilt of fucking up even a little bit, so I hurt myself to punish myself. Its the only thing that makes me feel a little better when I fuck up. I have been sexually abused 3 times. The first instance started at the age of 10 and ended at the age of around 12. My childhood best friend had started acting really strangely, cutting me off for no reason and telling me he hated me and treating me like shit. Essentially, we made a trade I get to stay friends with him if I send him videos and pictures of myself. He never told me why he started acting this way. The second time was the worst one. There is serious background to this. I made a new best friend in 4th grade, and we have been super close ever since. We had a mutual crush on each other for years. In 9th grade, I couldnt handle the stress anymore, and set my suicide date as New Years 2017. By some stroke of luck, my best friend invited me to an Xbox party and talked to me all night long and distracted me from killing myself, and we confessed our feelings for each other that night and started dating on January 4th, 2017, during my 9th grade year. We have been together ever since. However, in 10th grade, he admitted to me that he had a fat fetish. I was mortified I was pretty overweight back then from stress eating, and had no self esteem, but I tried it out because I loved him. It was horrible. I told him we needed to stop doing that, and that I was going to get fit and lose weight. He then insisted that if I did that, he wouldnt love me anymore.",
    "Advice on how to deal/make progress So, Im currently in a hole with my depression, and I could use some advice on what to do and ideas on how to approach things, as Ive done a lot already. Its a bit of a story, but I will keep it as brief as possible. If youre reading this and want to help, thanks in advance! So depression has been a thing all my life, but I only got a diagnosis around 10 years ago Im 33. I am also disabled, having a diagnosis of autism and suffering from chronic fatigue. I got therapy, and eventually, medication. The therapy CBTlike didnt really help, but at least talking to someone was nice at times I had a good therapist. The medication did help. I was put on 50mg sertraline. Fast forward a few years, and I start to do worse. I get sick with bowel pain that appears to be persistent. A few other difficult things in my life happen, and my depression starts coming back. The pain eventually becomes so hindering I have to stop work entirely. I get a pretty intense comprehensive therapy program for dealing with unexplained symptoms, and it is overwhelming. I lapse back into deep depression. The decision is made to up my dose to 100mg sertraline, and I climb out of it. The lessons I learn from therapy eventually help, and helps me control the pain and lessen it somewhat, although the fatigue actually intensifies. Fast forward to around now, covid times. Turns out, telling someone with a tendency for severe depression stay inside and have as little contact as possible is a recipe for bad times. I live in a place where I dont have a social network, a result of them moving away and me trying but so far being unable to because disability and dependency on social housing, which is a mess. So events were very important to me, and theyve all been canceled now for about a year and a half. I honestly do pretty well for around 10 months longer than I expected, before things get bad and I seek out my psych again. The decision is made to up my sertraline dose to 150mg, although I note I am seeing a pattern of it stopping working every 3 years.",
    "Placing too much on outside help? Hello, I 20m am a Junior in college. I have dealt with social anxiety, self esteem issues, and most recently depression for nearly half my life. It was a result of reactionary behavior I caused my own problems and I have never been able to shake it, as I tell myself I am incapable of change. Cause yourself problems once, you will sure as hell cause them again I have been spiraling more or less over the last few years, and only now am I sane enough to look at my lifelong issues. Unfortunately, I recently moved to a new city where I know no one. The loneliness has recently gotten to my head, and that combined with the stressfulness of college has me incredibly overwhelmed. Suicide has been on my mind more and more lately until I told myself today I would do it. But here I am. I have an appointment with a therapy clinic lined up on 59 May 9th  USA, but I do feel guilty to an extent. All that goes through my head upon dealing with my problems is tell the therapist and they will assist you in making sense of it. This has me feel irresponsible and ridiculous. There has been many people in life who cant afford help and have gotten along just fine. Its your life, and at the end of the day its on you to fix it. Yet at the same time I am so lost. All that goes through my head is my inner critic, saying its pointless. Sorry to ramble. My point being, those who have had success beating their issues on their own, what techniquesroutinesactivities did you use  partake in? What helped change your perspectives? Any feedback is appreciated thanks for reading if for some reason you got this far",

    "I’m so depressed and anxious all the time, what do I do? So I know no one on this sub can help my mental health and thats ok! But I just have no idea what to do with these feelings or thoughts and quite frankly I dont want to be alive all that much. Im young, 17 and my life so far hasnt been as hard as some peoples but its not been the best and this last 2 years especially have been shit. Constant battle with what Im thinking could be adhd, ocd, anxiety and depression although Im not diagnosed so im taking most of these titles with a grain of salt until I do It makes me wonder if all of my adult hood is going to be shit too, I cant quite imagine myself as the happy version of me I used to be, especially going forward. I see nothing beginning to help me. Ive tried substances and techniques and they dont help. Other than weekly therapy and being doped up on some meds I dont see any other options. Has anyone else felt lost, empty, and frustrated in this way and gotten better? Any success stories about conquering mental health? Thanks yall",

I dont even know him that well, but at the time it was so easy. He was real kind and nice about it, and reassured me it was good to talk. But waking up today I just felt worse. I havent gotten out of bed and were well into the afternoon. I texted today, but no response. Maybe it was all a mistake. Maybe I shouldnt burden people with my problems.

Every day I am screamed at for not automatically going to cut wood or do the dishes and other chores. I am called lazy by my parents and my younger brother. I started to play video games because as a child I was never allowed any type of electronic and I was extremely curious. Because of how my family treated me I started playing more and more video games and it became the one thing that I actually felt motivated to do. I began lying to my parents about what I was doing and when my school gave me a MacBook with special programs in it because I have ADDI played video games on that. I became addicted and still am. My parent filmed me on a camera and now all my homework must be done in front of a camera. I am just sick of how everything in my life is falling apart. My parents made a contract for me to sign about the rules of the house. I signed it. There are special things like, finish all homework get 30 mins of screen time. There are also stupid rules like at lunch no tv, only homework. My parents want me to do exercise but I am already 6ft1 and 150 pounds. They scream at me when I want to use my 30 mins of screen time after I have done my homework. On weekends I sleep for 14 hours and I just feel like I am in a constant cycle of screaming and pain. My parents threatened me with violence and to take me out of my dream school. I worked very hard to get in. My life is horrible and I am considering just giving up on everything and ending it.

    "Soon to be dad and I’m struggling to cope So Ive written posts about this before but heres the basics. My pregnant girlfriend split up with me. She said she dident love me anymore. I lost my temper and said some things I shouldnt have which I admit was my fault. We dident talk or have any contact for 6 weeks I drunk heavily during this time and my depression was unbearable. I eventually reached out and apologised and explained I wanted to be there for the baby. She agrees I meet her for the first time since we broke up and she makes it clear she never wants to get back together and just wants to be friends. So since then Ive cut right back on my drinking intact I dont drink anymore. As the son of a alcoholic looser father I dont want that for my child I want to be a good dad. Anyway every time I talk to her it feels like a kick in the teeth. So I actively avoid messaging her and only respond to her when she messages me cause of all the pain it brings up. The only thing keeping me going is the baby. But its been 10 weeks since we broke up and I still feel just as broken and miserable inside. I dont have any friends I sit on my PlayStation all day just trying to zone out and focus on something other than how miserable I am. I thought that when I stopped drinking I would feel better and to be honest I dont I still feel like shit. I have a therapist whos helpful and a support worker to help me not go back to drinking. But it doesnt help much and to be honest I just dont know what to do anymore.",
    "Lost in a rabbit hole @_@ Hi, Im 23 years old and I tend to feel like Im wasting time. I stopped going to college at the end of 2017, I didnt go back for the fall semester. I found two pretty good jobs until they both laid me off, due to the fact that they were only seasonal. After that I havent felt like filling out applications, instead Ive been pursuing my dream job. I want to be a journalist and lately Ive been so far down the rabbit hole of story writing I feel like I nearly lost touch with reality. I know in order to learn you have to fail over and over and thats how I feel. At the same time I feel like Ive been spending way too much time writing and researching I forgot when the last time I talked to another human being. Im not that close to my family and I only have a couple friends, who seem to be busy most of the time. When Im not obsessing with writing I catch myself day dreaming about a perfect world where I go out on the weekends and have fun. I have never really experienced that and the thought makes me feel alone or that this humanity. People are just words on a screen now. If anyone has any tips please let me know!",

    "Help. Depressed husband. How to best support and love? Hi! I believe my husband is depressed but not completely admitting to it yet. We have been together 14 years and have children together. I love him dearly. His depression has manifested itself in pushing me away, anger and hostility towards me, I believe as a defense from trauma in his childhood that has been retriggered in the past few years. I am basically his scapegoat for everything wrong in his life. He also is distant, wont talk, and uses TV and books as an escape which are at thankfully healthy but spends considerable time in them. I would love ANY solid advice on how to navigate this. How can I best love him through this? Especially if his instinct right now is to push me away. Any dos or donts? Can I leave affirmations  encouragement for him in the form of notes? This is killing me slowly inside. I miss my friend. He is such a fantastic guy and I feel as if he has been swallowed by a dark cloud. Also to note we are in the beginnings of couples counseling. Thanks again for advice. Especially if you have been that husband and come out healed on the other side.",
    "Any other depressed mental health professionals out there? Im wondering if theres anyone here who can relate... I am on my doctoral internship which, is my last step towards getting my doctorate in clinical psychology. I had to move 1000 miles to start my internship which is obviously stressful because Im away from everything familiar and my support system. And its stressful because Im stepping into new role working 40 hours a week as a professional, rather than being a student and working part time. And my anxiety has affected my work. And the more my supervisors have provided what was intended to be constructive criticism the more I have felt like a worthless piece of s. And the more Ive messed up, the worse their criticism has gotten. And now my supervisors want to meet with me next week. Pretty sure Im going to be put into some kind of remediation. Or fired. And I feel like such a worthless failure I dont think I can make it through this year. And I cant help but think that my life is over, and I should just be done with this. My 8 years of education in psychology and hundreds of hours of therapy have not helped me get away from the feeling that I am worthless as a human being. I know where it comes from, but that doesnt solve things. I cant use cognitive restructuring to think myself out of how I am feeling. I have tried and Ive tried and I dont know if I can do it anymore. Sometimes I think Im going to be OK, I think I can pull myself out of this. But wondering if theres anyone out there who can also understand what its like to understand themselves on an intellectual level but still feel completely unable to fix their selfdestructive behavior? Any therapists who can pay attention to their patients needs and then be unable to meet their own, or who wonder how they can help clients when their clients are more healthy than they are?",
    "I don’t understand the point in living I thought I had it figured out with religion. But religion ended up being just another idol that failed me. Now I feel even more lost than before. I cant seem to wrap my mind around suffering. I cant understand why we seem to be in this universe just to suffer and die. Maybe others find enjoyment in life, but I cant seem to get any. If were just supposed to toil and work to nourish ourselves only to continue to toil and work until we die, why delay our inevitable death? Why not just commit suicide? I know this is dark, but this feels like the most rational conclusion. I need help.",

But once Im home, Im utterly depressed, because I have nothing to do. I have hobbies I used to love, but at this point, starting to do something anything at all seems like a tall hill to climb. So I just nap and browse the internetsocial media. Because that doesnt require effort. I used to have passions, like art and music. I used to write, draw, sew, exercise, watch tv, watch movies, and read. I cant seem to focus properly. Ill be trying to read something, but dont understand whats going on. I cant remember anything, either. I cant wake up in the morning. I tried antidepressant medication, but they actually make me 100x worse. So now, I need to find natural ways to get up, do things, find passion. Id like to have a schedule, but every time I try to make a schedule, I cant stick to it. Something is wrong, and I dont know how to fix it or balance myself. Someone could tell me, Just do it. But that isnt going to help, because theres an important piece of the puzzle missing for me to just do it. Im not sure why I am this way now. Any advice? Anyone share this same experience?",

    "Ex broke up with me because he was depressed and said he still has feelings for me He and i were together for 1.5 years. He had depression since the beginning because of his psycho parents. His dad said he hates him and told him to die because of high medical expenses. He said that he cannot be in a relationship because of his depression and said he probably will never fix himself because he is depressed to the point that he will never be fixed. Since the beginning of our relationship he said he was dealing with depression. He also said he will leave his parents house after the summer for college which made him upset. He wanted to leave as fast as possible. He told me that his dad abused him in front of his extended family and nobody saved him. This made him extremely depressed. He said rn is not the right time to be in a relationship and I completely understand why he is doing that. He said that he still has feelings for me and that he will never be happy with me if he doesnt love himself. I completely understand his stance and I gave him space. 1. Do you think he will come back? 2. Do you think his life will get better when he leaves his abusive family?",
    "List of ways to treat yourself So Im writing a list of nice things to do for myself when I really feel awful and have been too mean to myself. Was wondering what pick me ups you guys have as I want this list to be super super long and range from things that are completely free like painting my nails to paying for things like a massage, things that require barely any effort for the days I cant get out of bed like maybe songs to play and things that are super adventurous and cool for those few days I have bursts of energy and ambition.
