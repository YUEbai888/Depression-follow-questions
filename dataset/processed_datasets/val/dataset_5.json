    "My insecurities are everyone’s plaything. Ive been through a lot and its insanely diffcult to open up about them, so it seems to family I act the way I do just because I chose to. Im constantly being made fun of for not doing certain things and I get really offended and uncomfortable. I prefer not to share what, but I usually tell them to quit it, yet theyre always like its a joke or youre so over dramaticbuzz kill. Now I dont ever say anything because now I have the reputation of being the negative Nancy of every social event. I even have a certain family member who pry into my business cause they want to know my secrets. Why isnt boundaries a thing anymore? Sometimes I think to myself I should just blurt out what Ive been through just to have a greater chance of letting them leave me alone, but its scary and personal. I cant even write them in a journal, to my past therapist who I saw for six months, or friends I trust. I hate myself everyday for always keeping things in. Im a coward. I feel trapped in my mind. Always telling myself to forget, but think about it everyday anyways. What do I do to change? How can I escape this constant degradation from people? Thanks for reading.",
    "Cymbalta Not looking for medical advice Anyone tried Cymbalta for depressionanxiety?? I was on Effexor and came off because we thought about getting pregnant. Since then Ive been crying, feeling depressed, irritable and lose my temper over nothing. I feel like I need something since I obviously cant control my moods unmedicated. When I came off Effexor I had about a week of pure hell from withdrawals. Im nervous to start new meds and would like some input. Proscons. Not sure what other option I have seeing as its causing relationship problems.. any advise or words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated.",
    "Just been rough for the past month I dont really know what Im hoping to get by writing this but, Ive been doing really poorly lately. I get up, I work for 910 hours straight consulting job, then I feel too exhausted to do anything else... I go to the gym at night, then I pass out and do it all again. Ive been so miserable and so overwhelmed, and I hate myself for being so incapacitated. Most of all, I think Im freaked out by feeling like itll always be like this. Ive been putting so much effort into keeping my baseline up  I eat regular meals, I sleep 8 hours, I work out, I meditate, Im on antidepressants, and Ive been going to therapy for two years. Ive been feeling better, but again I still feel like shit, all the time. I cant stop belittling myself. Its so scary, and it makes me so angry. I dont understand how everyone around me, my family and friends, can go through the same stressors as me and be fine. And not feel concerned about their work, their relationships, if what theyre doing is enough, and not be exhausted all the time. I feel so alone in this. My parents and friends dont really support me in this the way that I need them to, and I snap at them, and then I feel bad because I know theyre trying their best, and they dont need to be here for me at all. I just feel trapped in my own anxious thoughts, alone.",
    "Antidepressants has ruined me Im 17 and ive been taking antidepressants for a while and I was just changed to a new one and I was taking small doses of the other ones to wean me off of it ever since I was off Ive been suffering from antidepressant withdrawals. I feel really dizzy and tired all day Im irritable I have weird pressure feelings in my head like zapping and Im starting to feel nauseous Ive felt like this for three or four days and I thought it was my new pills but it only started when I stopped taking my old antidepressants and I looked up withdrawal symptoms and I have them. I absolutely fucking hate pills I never wanted to go on antidepressants but I had to. Now instead of being nonfunctional and depressed now Im sick nonfunctional tired dizzy and depressed and my mom is really scared. I hope these dont last long I just want to stop taking pills. Im going cold turkey off them",
    "This is too long and no one likes reading long shit but I just can’t take it anymore idk what to do Today I woke up to the sound of my neighbours bellow me screaming, arguing and slamming shit. Its been happening more often lately, especially on the weekends. I have ptsd, bpd, amp severe GAD amp depression. I moved out of my parents 4 years ago to escape a toxic home. I was raised in a family who always screams at each other, constant bickering, slamming shit and breaking furniture. I have grown severe mental issues because of my childhood and flinch easily at loud noises. I live in a very old apartment building in a rough part of town because its all I can afford. Covid robbed me of my dream job amp all friendships, so I have been a loser sitting at home playing video games all day to escape reality while living off EI. Im pretty sure my benefits just ended today, idk, Ive been too scared to look. Ive saved up 3 months worth of rent and Im too scared to spend any money because I dont want to get a job because Im too adhd for university and couldnt pick a career for the life of me. Now Im a jobless loser with 0 ambition to be a wage slave. I am stuck living in this apartment that used to be the nicer part of the shit area. Well thanks to covid, my rental management accepts anyone amp everyone to keep rooms filled so now theres lots of crackheads and sketchy people who live here. The lobby is always filled with garbage now, homeless peoples bikes and garbage bags parked INSIDE the lobby while they buy crack from suite 18 bc they marked in the elevator. Oh theres now crackheads spraying grafiti on the inside of the elevator door too. I am living in a shithole, but this is what I get for being a useless loser living in poverty. The walls and floors are paper thin so I awoke to the couple beneath me screaming and slamming. I left the apartment at 10 am to escape the incoming panic attack I would have if I listened to it any longer. I come back at 2pm praying they would be done, but nope. Still screaming at each other.",
    "Could someone offer some advice on how to be a functioning adult? Ive been depressed my entire life. Because of this, Ive spent all of my time doing what was required of me such as homework, taking care of basic needs such as eating or sleeping, and mindlessly refreshing social media or the news. I have no hobbies or interests or skills or ability to take care of my mental wellness. I can probably survive on a physical level I know how to work, how to pay taxes, how to pay bills, how to get in contact with someone to rent an apartment, that sort of thing. But I have no idea how to stop being so miserable all of the time. I cant keep a job without feeling suicidal almost every day because I need to work although I force myself to keep one anyways, I cant pick a future career path, I cant motivate myself to pursue hobbies, I cant even do things that make me feel happy because nothing really does as far as I know. What Im asking is how do I stop just surviving and start living? How do I fit a fulfilling life around all of this stress and overwhelming deadlines and responsibilities? How do I actually be an adult? I can do the basic things I need to in order to keep my physical body alive, but I have no idea how to do anything beyond that. Thank you guys for your help, and I hope something great happens to you today like finding an unexpected 20 in your pocket.",

I need help. I wont get into too many details, But My Wife F26 Said that she doesnt love the person I have turned into, she told me things she doesnt like about me and Im trying to fix them. She Broke my heart this last week and my Brain is trying everything it can to hold on to her.

    "I have been severely depressed and it is affecting my school work and looking for advice Since Ive hit my 20s, my depression has just plummeted. In high school, I hadnt been diagnosed yet with my anxiety and depression, and even though it was present it didnt feel nearly as bad as this. I hit my 20s, now 23 yrs old, and I am having constant depression cycles. The cycles are becoming more frequent and each time it feels harder to come out of. As of lately I have been probably the most down that I have felt to date. I am in my sophomore year of college as a bio major. I havent been keeping up with classes, I have been failing exams and I dont have nearly enough credits to keep my scholarship for my junior year. I have fucked myself so badly with school I dont know what to do. I want so badly to take a leave of absence to get myself together, up my medication and see a therapist. I really want to get better. However, if I take a leave from school I will lose all financial aid for my junior year as well. My fiancé and I are pretty financially responsible people and have budgeted out for the next year and a half based on the financial aid we both receive. It is not an option to lose that money or we will be completely fucked. I am asking advice on what to do. I need to take a break from school or I will just keep digging myself deeper into this GPA and depression nightmare, but we also cant lose any money from it. I do want to reenroll for the fall semester, but I just need a break now. I am lost. Any advice would be so helpful.",
    "I'm failing out of college and idk what to do So Im in my first semester of college, not a fancy one but one that I was kinda surprised to get into. Ive had 3 cousins go thought the same college and graduate easy. Im not good at studying and have gotten help but I dont think its working. Im always extremely depressed and cant find the energy study or go out with friends. None of my family knows except my mom and the only thing shes told me to do is to do better. I wont be able to go into next semesters classes without passing my current ones with a C or better. Im so lost and I dont know what to do or how to even start. If I fail out of college there isnt anything for me to do besides fast foodcustomer service. Any advice on helping my depression so I have motivation to study or tips on studying would be greatly appreciated.",
    "To everyone who actually took time to read this, thank you for caring for me, a random stranger who probably doesn't deserve getting much help anyways. I got depression around the age of 11, but I just never bothered to get myself help until I was close to really cracking down from all the stress and anger Id hold in from all my encounters with my sister and her husband. We dont get along, and they always gang up on me, saying how my best friend did this better than me, I was always so bad at this or that, or how I was so fake and I always lied to them. They say other things too. My mom started this nightly ritual for me, and it really helps. Shed take Vaseline, which would help heal wounds, and shed spread it all over my arm where Id hurt myself. Then after that she takes this long seethrough sash, and shed tie and secure it on my arm so I dont pick at my wounds and scabs at night, because I do that a lot just so I could feel the pain. But every time in the morning and afternoon, Id always reopen and add more cuts and pinches onto my arms. This really stresses out my mom because I never stop, even if she really begs me to. I just get mad at her and say that it helps me. Today, I had gotten into a pretty bad argument with my sister and brotherinlaw. The previous night, I snuck my iPad into my room no electronics in my room, and I stayed up till 4 am playing and talking with friends, who were pulling an allnighter. It was fun, until my brother in law read my messages without me know and he found out. He got really pissed, and they enforced my already strict parental controls on my iPad, and now I can only strictly use it for a few hours at a time. They also deleted a few of my apps they didnt like me using because they didnt use it and found it a waste of time the apps were things like TikTok and some games. While I was using my iPad, my brother in law got all in my face and pointed out how I already used my iPad for 4 hours already, so he told my sister to block my iPad so I could stop using it.",
    "my LDR boyfriend admitted he has depression and wants a break because of it for context, my boyfriend and I are in an ldr for over 1.5 years now. hes from japan and im from america. depressionmental illness are very much taboo, as is even things like therapy, in japan. its just not something thats socially acceptable to even talk about there, so i cant imagine how hard it must be for him now. weve never had any major fightsdisagreements until this confrontation happened on thanksgiving day. he has been studying abroad in europe for the semester, and its definitely taken a toll on him he knows and admits that this is one of the major reasons he is feeling the way he is now. hes homesick, doesnt have any close friends, and has recently found out one of his best friends from high school is addicted to drugs. overall.... its been a really crazy semester for him, and lots of shitty things happening in my personal life as well. its just not a good year for either of us, but our relationship has been really strong. i had just booked a nonrefundable flight to visit him for christmas, my birthday, and through to new years. i noticed that, compared to when we discussed this visit during our last time together 1st week of november, he was significantly less excited. i knew something was off, but he wouldnt say. this weird vibe kept persisting through the week, and on thanksgiving night, i asked him what was wrong. he finally admitted to me paraphrasing i dont think i can love you anymore. not because i love someone else or lost interest in you, but im feeling really depressed recently, and i cant enjoy things. i cant even be excited for your visit. now, im just needing a break. Im not saying I wanna cut you off completely, but at this moment idk how to even talk to you. what Im doing is not giving up, but cleaning myself up. i just need time. he keeps saying things like this, which is hard for me to accept because I know what its like to be depressed.",
    "Help? Im not sure how to start or talk about this i hate asking for help or putting my problems on others but im realizing i probably need to talk to someone. Ig ill just say im not sure what to do with myself. Ive repressed emotions my whole life to the point that up until last weekend i dont think id cried since i was a kid even going through relationships and losing people emotionally or physically just nothing. My mom has mental issues she never told me about until just recently when i tried talking to her about whats been going on with me as shes an incredibly private person but i had my first anxiety attack this past weekend and cried more than i can remember ever crying. Ive lost interest inthe hobbies that made me who i am. Ive slowly lost all my friends after getting out of highschool 2 years ago and i used to have a big group. But i have no one to talk to or be able to open up to now that im trying to. Most of them i fell away from slowly or had a falling out with but my best friend since 3rd grade killed his sister after having a psychosis episode he was my go to always there for me and i grew up alongside his sister tho whole time. I work with his dad and do talk to him about this stuff but theres only so much i can talk about with him as he lost both his son and daughter in the same night and doesnt know how to handle things himself. The other person i was incredibly close with completed our trio died of an overdose a few hours after id left his house. Ive never had a girlfriend who i really opened up to or caught feelings for but now that i did i just fucked things up by overthinking things and id never quite cared for a girl like i do her. Im so lost. Thanks for reading you beautiful people",

    "At what point is someone ill enough to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital? Early this year, I tried to kill myself, and I asked my psychologist if I could be admitted to the government psychiatric hospital cant afford private so she she some research into it and they said that Im not ill enough. This time, I have a detailed plan with a guaranteed method of killing myself, theres no way it could fail, and a set date. But I want to go to the World Cup in Qatar next year. The thing is, as much as I want to go for that, the life that I face in the wait until then us quite horrific. Im going to be forced to go to university and I refuse to do that, but I know its going to result in massive fights with my family where Ill be cornered and ridiculed as a failure, and I wont have support support friends either because they agree that university is best for me.

    "Feeling lost, alone and dwelling on the past Im looking for some advice. Ive really been struggling over the last couple of weeks. I live alone, I dont have any friends or partner and I have spent the majority of the last year isolated and alone. Spending so much time alone means that Im constantly over thinking things, dwelling on the past, beating myself up over mistakes, even things that happened years ago, everything feels like its a much bigger problem than it is. How can I leave all this behind? I know that I cant change the past, whats done is done, I can only learn from my mistakes in the future, but I just cant let things go. I dont enjoy life and I have nothing to look forward to. I dont want to die or anything like that, but I am sick of constantly being miserable and worrying about everything, unfortunately distractions only work for so long.

I feel awful and I know that I need to bathe, and i do, but its about 4 times a week or less.

    "Can't move on. I think it's the end for md Hello Reddit. Ive come here today to say what I feel in my core, and if I cant take anymore, then may this be my suicide note and my farewell to humankind. Im 24 years old, male, Brazilian, and I cant take anymore. I think about the only thing I was able to accomplish in my life, failures. As a middle class person on a average poor country, I always had everything handed. Was handsomely educated thanks to my familys money. Always were quick to learn stuff and was English fluent at 15. However I never managed to be able to study, to take time away from what I felt like doing, which is play video games or playing bassguitar, and this caused me to have low grades on school, and bring trouble to my relationship with my parents. After school I went to college but dropped out because it was not what I wanted to work with. Then I got into another college and dropped out again. I always liked listening and playing instruments, and Ive been playing bass since my 16. Decided, then, to become a musician. Turns out I cant study music, just like I couldnt study anything when I was a teenager. I work at a shit job that pays me a laughable salary, I dont have any skills that could help me get another job and I am unable to learn any skills from scratch. Everytime I try to learn something, for example, music, I fail. Nowadays, when Im not working at my shit job, I am drinking, playing video games or doing any other thing that would make me forget who I am and push the hurtful feeling and thought away. I cant take this anymore. I dont know if Ill be alive tomorrow, but I thank every and each one of you who reads this, I have no one else to say what I feel of think. Goodbye.",

I find myself wondering how long it would take people to realize I wasnt there. I dont want to hurt my self but I find myself wishing more and more to seriously disappear. I feel unloved and unwanted right now. No one reaches out to me to see how Im doing. I dont have any friends and the only person I talk to really is my husband.

I had him for almost 11 years and he kept me alive. I adopted a new cat but its not the same. He hasnt been around long enough to have the same connection.

I hate my job so that makes me depressed, I go to the gym everyday but I always end up hating myself by then end because everyone there is more attractive and fitter then me and ill always be ugly and fat and no one will love me, I go home to do homework and I end up depressed because I hate school, then I try to take my mind off things by playing a video game, watching a movie, or listening to music but even then I become depressed because I start to think about what a piece off garbage I am because I could never create anything like the things im enjoying. I cant hang out with my friends because eventually, they piss me off because while I love them to death, they can become very annoying and make me angry. I cant really meet new people because I am so afraid that people will not like me that I do not even try, which also screws up my dating life as well.

She posted on her story a picture that said being constantly let down by the one person you looked up to all your life is really exhausting. Which hurt, but its absolutely true.

    "Medication mood drops Hi, Ive been on two medications for a short time. Clomipramine for my depression and Methylphenidate commonly known as ritalin for ADHD. While I have noticed and upturn in my general mood, it seems to drop throughout the day at regular times. Before 10am, Im actually quite good and productive. By 11, I can feel a real drop in my mood. By 1pm Im completely gone and miserable for the rest of the day. Basically Im just wondering if others have experienced this kind of mood drop when put on meds.

    "Still on the fence For a long while now I have been depressed and havent really had many close friend and for a little bit hitting a point of literally just 1 semi close online friend and no body else at all, but thats besides the point. For the last probably month or 2 I have been on the fence or just cant decide on what to do with one side being just live a happy life with a tightly knit group of girl and maybe online friends with possibly even a relationship and the other side being suicide. For the longest time Ive been leaning back and forth and thanks to friends Im feeling better some time but thanks to school and alot of punishments and groundings every so often and fairly recently having moved between states pushing me the other way. Im not sure if this is just me or amazingly common but I just dont know what to do any more and I want to be able to land on the right side of the fence on my feet and not fall back into a pit sorry if its an odd analogy. I just really dont know what to do since the only people who ever really reach out to me are semi close friends and just some school mates ending nonsense. All I do if sit around mostly unmotivated to make a difference and better things for myself by simple even doing homework but instead I feel like a lazy bum who uses his only bit of motivation to ask a handful of friends how their day was when I see them only but still feel like Im just pestering them. I mean its been almost half the school year now and the only person who sits next to me because they want to and not because their entire group moved to where I sit is my semi close friend I mention earlier. Ive got nearly no friends, got near nonexistant privacy, no motivation, and the only 2 things that I can always look back on for a reason to keep going are Im my dad only child and he put 15 years of effort into making my last this long and just the simple question of how can I do it quick without it hurting too much or looking a fool.",

    "Are antidepressants the nuclear option? Hi, I was in a serious car accident recently and walked away but Im left with some long term health issues that will take months to resolve because of waiting lists UK based. The health issues mean I cant take part in my main hobby as Ive been told that partaking in that hobby will lead to a worsening of the medical issue and lead to permanent damage. Over the last few weeks, Ive been struggling. Im low and on the verge of tears all day every day. I cant concentrate, I have brain fog, I forget what Im doing constantly, I have real trouble making any type of decision. I have a stressful job which requires me to be at my best, and Im not managing it very well. I take no enjoyment in anything I do, Im avoiding family and friends. The more time that passes, the worse I feel. Im guilty that I dont feel relieved that the outcome wasnt worse, Im angry that someone elses other drivers poor decision making has put me here. My friends and family my partner in particular are worried about me as I am not myself, I feel guilty about this too but cant bring myself to feel normal so I avoiding speaking to them. Im on a waiting list for counselling, and Ive been having regular catch ups with my doctor, but this week I spoke with someone new and within 5 minutes of speaking to me for the first time, she told me my symptoms suggested depression and prescribed antidepressants with a suggested minimum course of 1 year. I have a family history of depression, but this is the first time that I have been here, and medication feels like a huge step, especially seeing as she mentioned taking them for a year. I just want to get back to feeling like myself again, but what I have heard about antidepressants suggests that they wont be the magic fix. Am I right to be cautious of this new doctors advice or should I respect their medical experience and just go with it?",
    "Advice for holding yourself accountable? I want to change but I'm not sure how to go about it. Ive technically already posted this but I figured Id try and ask once more. What are some ways you held yourself accountable in regards to cleaning and self care and stuff like that? When I was really at my low I got to the point where all I would do was sleep so I didnt have to feel anything. I wantneed to get out of that and back to the person who could actually get up and do things. Its not like I dont want to do them but I let the place get so bad its so overwhelming to think about where to start and I just freeze. Im pregnant so Ive finally starting going to therapy because I want to be healthy not only for me now but for my future child. Me and my boyfriend are trying to move to be in a less stressful place but with the emotional ups and downs and pregnancy symptoms Ive been totally useless. I want to contribute and not just sleep. I need to break these habits and become a better person.",
    "Too much to handle She constantly feels entitled to just barge into my room to deliver twohour lectures about how she knows whats best for me, and how I should become the ideal daughter that she pictures in her head  a socially awkward, terrible at communicating, familyoriented yes woman, without any inclination towards her career and even if so, abysmally little interest must be exhibited. First of all, what a hypocritical thing to believe for a woman whod been to several countries for work, and secondly, why wouldnt she try to put herself in my shoes FOR ONCE? She ruined my life by forcing me to join a terrible college, despite me getting accepted into better ones  she blackmailed me by playing a whole bunch of cards  my fathers hard work card, my life will get ruined if I dont obey her card, Im only doing good for you card, and what not  just so she could persuade my dad to buy a new apartment in some random suburb village area. Then came her tantrums to move into the suburb, despite owning a good enough home pretty much within the city. She had absolutely no logical reasons to move, and the only backup she had were her delusions and the curses she hurled at me . Needless to say, she won again all I asked from her was two years of time for me to move away from her and leave her to her muchwanted peace from me by graduating from college. She has bad blood and beef with almost all of her and dads relatives, and the only backup she has is her father, who is a much more aggressive despot, who always thinks hes right, and others esp who are younger and financially more unstabledependent do not have a right to question the decisions he imposed on their lives. My father is said to have been a compulsive liar in the past, and he seems to have reformed now, but he feels incredibly helpless in this situation, despite this suburb house being his property. This quarantine has made the situation pretty much worse, and I really want out, but I dont know whom to go to and seek help from.",

    "Learning I have Alexithymia really fucked me up. Ive always accepted the fact that one day I will kill myself. I joke and say Im going to kill myself every once in awhile. Ive always felt empty and just figured that it was Depression and suicidal thoughts. I promised myself when I was little I would kill myself at 21, Im 23 now, Im on meds for depression and I go to a psychiatrist, I have a long term girlfriend who I can see a future with. However, that doesnt stop the fact that one day I will kill myself. I told my girlfriend I never want children or marriage because when I do kill myself itd be easier on everyone. I am getting a vasectomy soon so I dont have any dependents, Ive pushed people away, no, I forget other people exist because thats how much no one matters to me. A few days ago I learned that I have Alexithymia, which means I dont feel emotions. I never had a way of explaining how I feel until I found out what Alexithymia was. I have no feelings. I can not experience what I assume is one of the best things about being a human. I have no imagination, no creativity. I simply exist and thats it. Imagine playing a game thats in the first person. Thats my life, I just see stuff, I dont feel anything. Not to be cliché but I am nothing but a shell of a man. This really fucked me up, enough where I stare off, Im not very talkative and I get lost in my head that life truly is pointless. My girlfriend notices and shes kind of worried, she asked if I would be okay by myself before she left for work. I feel like this solidified that life is ultimately pointless, especially for me. I only see two options Kill myself or live in the prison that life is.",

    "what would you guys do? 27M from São Paulo, Brazil. I live with my mom, 53, and dad 88. Since 2012 hes diagnosed with Parkinsons and dementia. I struggle with depression since I was 15. mentally, Im always judging and blaming me for not having a job, not have become a doctor, rich, so I could pay caregivers for him, and hire someone for helping my mom at home. Ive graduated in History. But where I live in currently theres no job for teachers not to mention historian. I could tell all my story, but Im not looking for apologies. Im just desperate I dont want, Im not mentally able to take care of him. Im furious, frustrated and really angry to confront him sick. I fear to do him some harm if I get completely tired of things he is not blamed for not being able to eat, go to bathroom and walk for himself. Im seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist. But the meds are doing no good yet. What would you guys do? If you really feel unable to get out of bed. If all you wanted was to sleep and dont wake up ever again. To put some noise cancelling headphones in order not to even listen to his voice shouting all the time for help or moaning due to his illness? Please could someone help me? Send some piece of advice?

    "I think I'm severely depressed and I don't know how to fix it. First things first I created this account because I dont feel comfortable using my regular one, and this is the first post Im making with it, but Ive been a Redditor for the better part of a decade. Please dont hold my desire to remain anonymous against me. Thank you. Now that thats out of the way, heres why Im posting Im a 45yearold guy and only now have realized that Im just sitting around waiting to die. Most people wouldnt know that by looking at me though, because on the surface Im a happy, friendly, outgoing person, but on the inside I just feel empty and hopeless. I cant sleep, Ive overeaten to the point of morbid obesity, I have no friends, my relationship with my wife feels distant, I dont get out and go anywhere, I dont exercise, I have no career ambitions even though I have a steady job, and I just generally have given up on everything and I feel like Im just going through the motions. Its been like that for years. I lost my dad in the 90s, my mom died 12 years ago, my fatherinlaw died a year after that, my brother has stopped speaking with me, I broke my leg a few years ago and it never healed back as well as I wish it had, I hurt all of the time, and my quality of life has plummeted. I know I need to seek help, but I dont know how to go about it without feeling like a failure. The idea of medication repulses me, and opening myself up to a total stranger seems like a nonstarter, so I dont know what I should do. As a result, Ive done nothing, and my health is only getting worse. If anyone has ever been in shoes like mine, how did you fix the problem? What did you do to change? How can I even get motivated to seek help and support when I cant even motivate myself to exercise, eat healthy, or talk about stuff like this with my wife? I just feel like Im surrounded by dead ends and all I can do is fake it until death finally solves my problems for me.",
    "I don’t know anymore 22 F Ive been really bad depressed for a really long time. Anxious, suicidal. A lot of abuse and mental illness here. I had a lot of shit happen a month ago and Im struggling to deal with it now. I went numb until recently because it was just too much. I almost killed myself on a Monday. Wednesday I found out my friend did kill himself. Sunday was the funeral. Monday I was raped by someone I thought was my friend. Tuesday my boyfriend kept making suicide jokes. Wednesday I broke up with him. I cried over my friends passing. It hurts, I still get sad sometimes, but its out of my system for the most part. What isnt out of my system is the rape. I didnt realize it had happened until about a week ago. Like I knew factually we had sex and I felt like I cheated but I couldnt really remember it. Then a week ago I told a friend what happened and hes actually the one that pointed out uhhh thats rape. And I was like oh...yeah.... I guess so. Anyways I went numb after that but tonight thats broken. Ive cried so much for so long but I still just keep starting back up. I need to sleep because I have work tomorrow but Im struggling with sleeping alone. The tv isnt helping. Im always exhausted after crying but I just cant sleep. S",
    "Scared to call crisis services Im in the USA. I have no insurance and effectively no money like, none I have some family, but asking them is out of the question. Im pretty sure somethings pretty wrong, considering Ive been crying and panicking and bludgeoning myself and thinking about suicide for years now, but I dont have any resources to go to an actual doctor. Earlier tonight when I was more worked up I called the US national suicide prevention hotline. The guy I talked to gave me the number for mobile crisis services in my rural county. I explained my financialinsurance situation to him and he assured me that if I call them, a doctor with this service will come to my location and its free, no charge but even if its true, what then? I cant imagine theyre going to actually do anything except take me to a hospital, stick me there for a few days, maybe they give me some medication and then they release me and tell me to make a follow up appointment with a doctor somewhere I cant pay and probably cant physically get to no car, rural area, and I get a bill for the hospital stay. Which I categorically will not be able to pay. If thats what would happen, I truly am better off dead. TLDR I want help but I strongly suspect that if I ask for any, Im only going to get the opposite. Am I crazy or am I right?",

It doesnt seem like our cases of covid19 are severe like in other states, but I heard someting about borders being closed for couple months or years in our country depending on others states.

Ive always been a little sad, i mean, nothing to worry, i think, because i felt happy sometimes and used to enjoy things. Ive always been too obsessed about the way i look, i think in a pathological level, avoided meetings because a felt ugly, dont eat or eating way too much, etc, so thats why i think this situation feels particularly hard. About a two months ago i thought i had a cavity in my tooth i dont know the word in english for caries. I stopped smoking. I went to the dentist, it wasnt that, she cleaned my teeth, but i was feeling like my four frontal teeth are moving, she said they dont move but i feel it. She said i have bruxism so maybe its that, but i literally cant eat because i feel that movement and it driving me nuts. I used to wear braces when i was a teenager, now days i need them again, and i cant look at the mirror. I want to go back in time. Im crying all day, i dont eat, i constantly think about killing myself because thats just my life, everything goes the worst way it can go since always. I dont have money to go to therapy, i tried to talk to people but they dont take me serious and say i should stop bother them. My boyfriend really tried to make me feel better but nothing worked and i knew he felt frustrated and i think angry because of the way i talk, so i started to act like everything is ok. Today my mom said i was skinny and i felt like crying because i know it is because i feel so terrible. I used to love my teeth, they were the only thing i liked about myself, i used to love smiling, now Im crying all day, feeling stressed, thinkin about killing myself.

    "I want to go to the doctor about depression Ill spare the backstory, but after 15 years of feeling mostly bad and two attempts at counselling therapy Im prepared to give medication a go. Im not sure how to talk to a doctor about this I REALLY dont want to be seen as an attentionseeker and I have a habit of playingdown how I feel you get real good at acting over 15 years. Im in Wales in the UK by the way if that helps. I rarely got to the doctor about actual health issues since its so difficult to get an appointment and you only get to say about three words during your speedy 5minute slot with a doctor who youve never seen before ugh, its kinda free so I should stop moaning. Last time I spoke to my mom about it sparing some details Ive never told her about feeling suicidal and selfharm I do she just said Im probably feeling down because I had a lot of work to do at uni and I have a cold  Ive exhausted the other options. I hate having to seek help because men arent supposed to show emotions. Every single piece of depression info online just has to make sure they tell you that dEpReSsIoN iS mOrE cOmMoN iN wOmEn. Thanks for that. I just hope they suggest medication. My two experiences with therapy werent good I just desparately wanted to tell someone my whole story. All of it. I want someone who will listen to me for once. Instead I found it so hard to say anything personal or really true, sitting in horrible little rooms full of Buddha statues and pictures of sunsets being glared at by the therapist for getting upset while she sits there scribbling down notes you never get to see and and looking at the clock so she get get on to the next gulible sucker who pays 40 for 50 minutes of spilling personal information. I know Im a bad person I just hope medication will enable me to not be. Im sorry Im rambling since going to university Im 26 btw I have been feeling worse than ever before. Do you think its a good idea to talk to a doctor about this? If so, how? Thank you.",
    "Advice to an 18 y/o depressed closeted bisexual dude who mostly has anti-lgbt religious family &amp; friends and is contemplating suicide? this post got no replies in the depression subreddit so here I go Im an 18 yo dude. Im starting my first year of college this August. Ive been thinking about coming out as bi to a few friends that I care about and ones I hold dear, but Im afraid of what might happen if I do it. Were all Christians my familys Catholic. I know a lot of people I care about wont approve of me whenif I come out. I project myself as this straight guy whos just an allysupporter for LGBTQ rights. Ive fought with some religious friends as I defended the topic of samesex civil unions online amp offline. Its been about 10 months since I last went to a Sunday church service where I used to talk to some friends who go to church there. I still go to my neighborhood Catholic church because of my dad who put me in the choir along with my brother. My dads also the president of our Catholic church choir. Hes also VERY outspoken about being antiLGBTQ. I find it hard to come out to my family because were super religious Catholics. There was a time when my Born Again Christian cousin female came out, they recommended her to go to conversion therapy. I was one of the few family members who know this along with my older other cousin and some of my unclesaunts. I wont be coming out to my family. Maybe not yet. Or maybe not ever, considering the factors Ive just mentioned. My dad and I would probably fight if my family finds out. Its ironic that its hard to be open to your own family whom you share the same house with. Still havent catch up with a friendchurch leader from churchschool. I feel bad for ghostingavoiding friends from this church I used to go to Born Again Christian. The last time I went to that church was July 2018.

Most of our conversations are about her telling me how shitty she feels, sick, or seeinghearing stuff because of the meds or how she just wants to sleep all day. I decided to give her some space but today I really felt like calling her to check up on her and in the first 30 seconds of the call she started acting like an asshole to me and i got pissed.

    "I’m not sure if I have depression, please reply, I made posts to other subreddits and no one answered and it’s making me feel even worse Im 16F btw. For many many years Ive been extremely upset with my weight and my looks. I hate everything about me, I could give you all the things I hate about my appearance in a heartbeat. Sometimes when I look in the mirror I think oh I dont look too bad and sometimes I think oh god I cant go out Im so ugly. My weight has become a really bad obsession. I think that because of problems relating to how I see myself I might have gotten and eating disorder? Im not sure because I cant self diagnose. But, I have lost noticeable amount of weight by eating 12 times a day and limiting my calories. And Im not sure if thats extreme dieting or an actual eating disorder. Im scared to go to the extreme and go underweight Im close to being it because I have a deadly disease and could die if Im not eating properly. And Im not too educated on EDs so Im not sure if Im being too dramatic. Back to my depression, I moved during 5th grade and had no friends until high school, people openly avoided me because I kept asking people if I could play with them. This one group of friends made it extremely obvious that they dont want to be near me, which hurt a lot. Lots of boys said behind my back and in my face that Im ugly, horrifying, repulsive, a ugly octopus, sewer rat, etc. That really hurt me back then, still now. And I do believe Im all those things theyve said. Then a miracle happened. I made a friend. She was a cool kid and the time I spent with her was the best Ive ever had with someone besides my family. Then after few months out of no where she acts like I dont exist. She never spoke to me and treated me like a stranger, and it hurt so much it still bothers me. I thought that I did something wrong, that I wasnt good enough, or I was too ugly that she didnt want to be seen with me. Then in high school I finally made friends.",

    "I need help finding coping mechanisms TW suicide For most of my life, id always been extremely suicidal. I wont go into detail about my life but it sucks and heavily contributed to me having depression and being suicidal since before I even became a teenager. A couple years ago, I had a failed suicide attempt and thanks to the help of some people I managed to actually develop a will to live and I finally got rid of the suicidal part, but Im still struggling with the depression part. When I was suicidal, it was really easy for me to handle mental breakdowns by just telling myself Its fine. Ill just kill myself, I dont have to worry about the future that much. If things get as bad as Im fearing theyre about to, I have an easy way out. Now, whenever I have mental breakdowns I default to saying the same thing but then I start thinking Fuck. I dont want to die, I cant just kill myself. Theres no way out of this. and my mental breakdown continues and gets worse. Im really struggling with handling mental breakdowns. Even when I try to distract myself, either I fail to be distracted and keep overthinking, or it just pushes the breakdown further down the line and the moment I stop being distracted I fall back into the breakdown. Im trying to stay away from substance abuse. It works, but I want to stay healthy and I have personal experience with the dangers of substance abuse. Ive tried depression medication before but none of them really helped me much. Im considering therapy, but Im too anxious that revealing I used to be suicidal might make them worry Im currently suicidal and result in a psych ward situation. I dont know what to do anymore to cope, google doesnt really help, its hard. A clarification just in case, Im seriously not suicidal. I will not be killing myself. I dont need people spamming the comments telling me why I should stay alive, I just need help finding coping mechanisms please.",

    "I want to go home So Im fresh out of highschool, and Ive just started studying in the Netherlands  am doing my bachelors. I was diagnosed with clinical depression and autism 4 years ago, and was on some medication, but stopped my visits with my doc and stopped taking my meds because I couldnt accept it back then. So here I am now  at uni, and Im miserable. I want to go home. The separation anxiety along with the constant feeling that Im not meant to be here is killing me. Im constantly crying, Ive had way too many thoughts about taking one too many pills which I havent thought about in a really long time, and I miss my dad he passed away. I really love what Im studying, but I cant stay here I dont even know what the problem is, Im not able to concentrate, I dont feel like doing anything or staying here. My mum has made it clear that I can come back if I want, and that she will support me in getting an education closer to home. My father always wanted me to get a good education, and wanted me to have a good life, but I dont know how to. I dont even know what the problem is, which is why I cant fix it and I really just cant take it anymore. I want to go home, and I want all of these bad feelings to stop. I want someone to help me but Im scared of the comments my external family will make if I go back Im scared Ill let a good opportunity go Please tell me what to do",
    "I need ideas.... Im about to be 33 years old, have never been able to get a job due to a lack of abilityskills and the fact that I was born with disabilities  the big one being a developmental disability Spina Bifida. Whats more, I have little interest anymore in attempting to GAIN any skills due to unbelievable levels of frustration and depression Im also inquiring about this in a disability subreddit. Anyway, outside of forcing myself to TRY to learn skills that I have absolute interest in whatsoever and am convinced are still far from any sort of guarantee of being able to land me a job, what can I do to stave off intense boredom everyday, repeating the same routine of sitting on my fat, lazy, SEVERELY work ethiclacking ass all day doing nothing but watching t.v. which sucks during the daytime when all it is  is repeats ive seen dozens of times, and surfing the internet which Ive done so much by now that Im actually bored of the internet to some degree LOLSMHFML. Im hopeful that when I finally get the call that I can move into an apartment building that is specificaly for lowincome PwD, that in time Ill either be able to buy my own video game system or a holiday or something will roll around and get somebody to buy me one as a gift. That will at least give me a third thing to do in addition to perhaps when I live there and my SSDI slightly increases due to the fact that I wont be living with my parents anymore, MAYBE Ill have enough disposable income to also watch movies from time to time? I know most of you are going to say that I need to volunteer, and while that is a good idea and was doing that briefly in the past before they got rid of me because they needed to use me more than I could offer, I am currently recovering from a series of 3 surgeries, and am not really at a point where I can feel comfortable leaving the house and volunteering like that  if I could even find something youd be surprised how hard it was for me to find something in the first place.",
    "How do you deal with losing all interest in your passions in life? A few years ago, a really bad breakup turned into a long term depressive episode, and I lost all interest in the very few passions in life that define me. I spend a lot of time really missing being in love with what I used to do the way I previously was from time to time I even have the tendency to try to push myself into giving it another spin. But every time I try, it feels like a job, and all motivation and determination I have gets sucked straight out of me. I just want to love doing music again, because Ive been such a bland, shell of a person since I suddenly fell out of it. Does anyone experience such extreme loss of passion and interest in big things in your life? How do you cope? Its been 3 years and Im struggling still, and Im honestly losing hope that Ill ever really love something that much again .",
    "I'm close to suicide Im 38, Im feeling suicidal and numb. Nothing to live for. I have been unemployed for 1.5 years, since then no one contacted me for an interview. My skills are as a researcher without an MA. I gave up looking for a job. I live with my parents. My last relationship was 6 years ago with my friend, lasted 3 months, she did it out of pity. Before that I only had 2 same length relationships with years in between. Before that my childhood and teens were in Saudi Arabia, so nothing. My motivations in life were to support financially and psychologically my cousin and my single mother friend, first got into a relationship the other leaving country soon and Im not working to support her. Now the only thing keeping me from taking the exit is to not hurt my mom. I dont have close friends but my blessing in life are my cousins, who I cant see because of covid 19 and they arent enough to fulfill my life or from committing suicide. Please help!! !",
    "Depression or just “messed up” Hi, Ever since I was 17 15 years ago my life has been crap. I had a long term boyfriend who treated me like crap for 12 years, lied to me, stole from me and was emotionally abusive to me. I had a child with him and finished with him 3 years ago. I then met someone, he was ok in the beginning but then he started purposely saying things to hurt me like saying Id be the worst person in the world to have a kid with, how hed never marry me, and also call me a fat ct Im not actually fat he apologised for all of that saying he only said it because he wanted to hurt me. but recently, hes started lying to me and then wed get in to a fight and hed say Im mentally sick and that Im really messed up and obviously have loads of insecurities. For the past 7 years Ive felt SO low! My mood changes so quickly, i get moody quite often, I am constantly doubting myself and after the recent lies from my current partner Ive come to realise I cant trust him or believe a word he says anymore. Ive also been having bad thoughts not so much suicidal, more that I think it would be so much easier for people if I just died In my head Ive put in place what would happen to my child if I did die. Am I depressed or just messed up from my past? Im so stubborn I dont want to talk to a doctor in fear they would laugh in my face and say Im just a waste of time. I dont want to speak to family in fear that they would pity me. I dont want to speak to friends because Id feel embarrassed. I cant talk to work because its such a stressful job theyd only worry that I may end up taking time off work! I dont know what to do anymore.",
    "How do I help my depressed sister? My sister comes to me almost every night talking about how she is depressed because she has 0 friends and she cant make any friends no matter how hard she tries. Her other problems consist of being 18 and not even close to having a boyfriend she has never had a boyfriend, being sick of school and wanting to skip getting her associates and getting straight to work, and shes also pretty self conscious of her body and her socially awkwardness in front of others. I am 16 and I truly cannot understand her issues. She talks to me for hours about her problems and when I try to give her advice she gets frustrated. I dont have any friends either, I am also socially awkward, and I also am very self conscious. We share all the same problems the only difference is that she cares way too much and I dont care at all. The advice I try to give her is to show her how and why she shouldnt care. I dont understand how she can care so much about these issues. I understand sometimes but its not a constant battle for me, I eventually continue not caring about my issues and am happy again. Im worried about her because she talks about wanting to kill herself and Im the only person in our family she can talk to because she is afraid of making my parents more depressed than they are. My questions are How do I go about caring for her? Should I just listen to her problems or should I advise her to care less? Perhaps neither of those things?",
    "I'm 16 and I'm a mess I feel like Im a shadow of an older self, like my real me died and I am just his shed, slowly crumbling to pieces. My mind feels blank and oversaturated all at once. I feel like Im not even the main character of my life anymore, Im not even sure if I ever was, I feel like Im just a background character, I feel like Im stuck on froze and I cant move an inch. I see all those opportunities of potential happiness go away, slip of my hand, I feel like Im constantly waisting my time just by being alive, I feel like Im losing so much time, I feel like Im watching all the best moments of my life pass me by and I will never get them back. I feel like I cant do anything anymore. I feel like its out of my reach, like Ill never anyone of importance, like Ill never positively impact peoples life like I always dreamed of. You know, the internet is a shitty place, not in all of its aspects, but in a lot of them. When I started using social media outside YouTube, in this case Twitter, I was around 13. I exposed myself to a lot of shit. To a lot of poeple and events I wish I never knew existed, to a lot of disappointments, to a lot of toxicity... Do a lot of you wonder if youre just weak? The internet often gave me that impression. I think Im weak, I definitely do, but I dont know how much. I dont know if poeple are just agressive pretentious entitled assholes that think their opinions make them somehiw better than everyone or Im just being too sensitive and itd just the way poeple state their opinion, I dont know. When I was 13, I played so much vidya, sometimes from 8 am to 8 pm non stop. When I discovered that one of my favorite games was hugely hated on the internet, it made me feel miserable, like my taste was inferior, like I was so dumb to like that thing.",
    "Antidepressants Antidepressants Hi! Ive been thinking to take antidepressants for a while now. I have sudden outbursts or breakdown episodes ? wherein I just cry and cry. I can feel the physical pain in my chest, or heart, specifically. Its so heavy. Ive been seeing a psychotherapist for a few months already, but it doesnt seem to help. It started because of work which I already resigned from 2 months ago. And then this pandoras box collection of traumatic events in my subconscious seem to have been opened so Ive been still experiencing the breakdowns despite seeing a psychologist. For people who took antidepressants Was it worth it? How was your experience with it? Did it help? Im sorry I just needed answers. I have no friends who took antidepressants before. Im also shy to reach to them, especially now that I need them the most. Thank you, strangers.",
    "I feel extreamly unmotivated to go on with life I see no point to this. I dont want to continue. I dont think Im depressed or anything, but if I was given the option to never have existed I would take it. I never asked for life and I dont think I want it. The only thing keeping me going I suppose is the trauma I would inflict if people found my body in my apartment. Besides that my parents spent a lot of money on my education and without me to provide for them when I finish they may end up in poverty. Im trying to do better but some things just seem to be taking me 10 steps back the moment I try harder. I think Im growing number to life. I have a final tomorfow and I dont care.",
    "How does one even find a will to live in this situation? I am completely and utterly lost as to how to justify continuing with my life. I live in a small town, I have no car, and I barely make enough money to afford rent even while working 67 days a week. I have no health insurance and Im falling apart at 25 due to all the health issues I cant afford to deal with or even get them properly diagnosed. My family despises me because Im gay. I dont even care about that anymore, but I have no lifelines to help with anything. My husband lives 12 hours away and its been my goal for 4 years now to get to him, but I cant afford it, and even if I could, I dont have a car to get a job once Im down there. He wont help me even though he makes 70k a year because I dont have the right mindset but I dont understand how my mindset could possibly be any different under the circumstances. I have been through every job in town and several out of town that I couldnt even get to for very long, and the shitty job I have now is the best paying one. I dont have the money or time to go to school, but thats all anyone ever suggests. Im not even at home 12 hours a week, yet Im supposed to somehow get to a community college in another city for 16 hours a week, plus 3040 hours of reading and homework? There literally are not enough hours in a week for that to work, and thats not even accounting for the money I dont have that it would cost me. It doesnt make any sense. Im grinding my face into the pavement just trying to make ends meet in a life I dont even want anymore. I cant even fathom whats stopping me from ending it right now, other than some primal instinct to survive. I have zero reason to go on.",

Either dont eat at all or eat way too much. Constantly stuck in why bother mode for literally everything. Dont want ot get out of bed ever, it only when Im forced for work or to go to the bathroom etc. I dont have a whole lot of a support system. Maybe a small amount of family left and an more small amount of kind of friends. And yes am in therapy but it doesnt seem to help. Seriously, soo sorry for the whole life story but again dont know this works exactly. I promise i wont be so long winded again..",
    "I have an extremely hard time waking up in the morning. Any advice? Hello everyone. For years now Ive had a really hard time waking up in the morning, and Im only able to get up at a reasonable time if its an absolute necessity. Even then I usually sleep in too long and am late for things. It generally doesnt matter how much sleep I get, I still feel tired. I can be super motivated to get up early as Im going to bed, but Ill still feel like a zombie when I try to wake up and wont even bother. Ive started exercising more and feel a bit better in general, but still havent found a way to fix this particular issue. I dont know why something so simple is this difficult.

I know theres people with bigger issues out there, but i really wish i could hear some kind words right now. I have no motivation to do anything productive at all anymore. I dont even wanna leave my bed. I used to draw a lot and play the piano, but now im just miserable. I feel nothing. All thats happening in the world right now is just too much for me. And the pandemic... This is a really lame problem but now i cant hang out with friends and i feel really lonely. I actually feel a lot worse than everything im writing right now, i just cant really describe it. Also, i use my phone almost all day long out of boredom and how empty i feel. I seriously feel like the world is ending. I either feel nothing, or sadness. Its honestly so tiring cause i feel like im wasting my life and theres so much i could do like pursuing my dreams but my depression is making it impossible.",

    "Feel as if I'm toxic because of my depression and anxiety, but I dont want to be As the title says, I feel as if Im toxic to those Im close to. When I ask they swear Im not, but part of me feels as if theyre saying that to be nice and not to hurt me. They let me ranttalk to them about things I deal with and how I feel, but I feel as if Im making them feel bad also and becoming more of a burden than a friend. I feel as if Ive ruined what couldve ruined any future with 2 different people because of it. I believe I understand and know the source of my depression and anxiety, and partly has to do with my familys religious beliefs. Yes Im a Christian, but my beliefs are different froms theirs and if they knew, it would be a huge mess and them possibly kicking me out. My parents currently help pay for my college, but Im hoping in the next year or so I can get a parttime job or internship to make enough to move out. Anyways, the only access to help I have is counseling at school. I want to be better and be happy and normall, but I dont know how and my parents beliefs mostly their church restrict me from doing so. I feel as if Im stuck and in a constant loop of finally being happy, something happening or realize what Im wanting to so is against what they believe, my anxiety getting bad, and then depressed. I have a close friend that tries to help me, but I feel as if he doesnt think Im trying to get better. He understands the situation Im in, but I still cant help but think that. I also got diagnosed with endometriosis which then restricts a lot of physical things I can do, which makes things worse mentally for me. Ive been asked by another friend if I have a hobby or something to keep me distracted, but I dont. I never did much activity growing up due to religious beliefs like sports or anything else. Even when I did find something I liked to do, I was told I couldnt anymore and had to give it up. I just feel as if Im stuck and I just dont know what to do anymore.",

    "Those who’ve dealt with it longer than I - how? So Im a 20 y.o. F whos currently on her sophomore year in college. I was diagnosed with severe depression and a panic attack disorder about two years ago. Since then Ive dealt with two changes in medication, a suicide attempt and moving away to my own apartment and away from all my family and friends. Since starting school Ive realized Ive become incredibly isolated. The only time Ill have human touch is when my boyfriend visits me for the weekend, and unless a professor or a group member speaks to me, generally throughout the day I wont have a conversation with anyone. Even my parents dont talk to me everyday. Ive joined a DnD group and have made attempts to push myself out of this crippling isolation but how do you make friends when more than have your days are bad mental health days? My depression has worsened significantly since moving and to help myself I got a 3 month old puppy that Im training to be my service animal. Honestly, that baby is most of the reason I get out of bed as puppies dont care if you have depression  they need to be trained. Ive also made another doctors appointment to see about yet another med adjustment. I also got in contact with a therapist but I honestly dont see how it will help much being as though I can only go to one session a month. I just dont know how Im supposed to live like this? Like is this going to be my life from now on just barely struggling by with less than a hand full of people who would actually give a shit if I failed miserably? I just need to hear from more experienced depressed individuals how did you survive?",
    "How do I start things and stay motivated again? I seem to be in a depression hole of a cycle. I can somehow still manage to go to college 5 days a week, and go to work on weekends. But once Im home, Im utterly depressed, because I have nothing to do. I have hobbies I used to love, but at this point, starting to do something anything at all seems like a tall hill to climb. So I just nap and browse the internetsocial media. Because that doesnt require effort. I used to have passions, like art and music. I used to write, draw, sew, exercise, watch tv, watch movies, and read. I cant seem to focus properly. Ill be trying to read something, but dont understand whats going on. I cant remember anything, either. I cant wake up in the morning. I tried antidepressant medication, but they actually make me 100x worse. So now, I need to find natural ways to get up, do things, find passion. Id like to have a schedule, but every time I try to make a schedule, I cant stick to it. Something is wrong, and I dont know how to fix it or balance myself. Someone could tell me, Just do it. But that isnt going to help, because theres an important piece of the puzzle missing for me to just do it. Im not sure why I am this way now. Any advice? Anyone share this same experience?",

I havent been diagnosed so I dont 100 know whats wrong with me, but my problems include Not having any motivation, not having hope for the future, getting irritated very easily over stupid stuff, being terrible at interacting with other humans, barely caring enough about my life to get out of bed, desperately wanting to be left alone for a couple of months, sometimes wanting to kill myself and so on... I have made two posts already and I guess Im mostly repeating the same things but I REALLY REALLY WANT ANY HELP  SUPPORT I CAN GET. II dont know just say something nice in the comments or something.

    "Feeling at the end of the line As I mentioned I have anger issues and while I was working one day my boss called me to his office just to yell at me about a complain I presented to management about an issue with my laptop, I used to use my personal laptop to work in the office because they couldnt provide one for me and when it broke I asked them for a replacement, apparently this was out of line for them and he just begun insulting me with my colleagues hearing everything in the next room, I almost lost it but kept it together just enough to put myself face to face with him and asking him to repeat everything closing my fist ready to beat the shit out of him, he just stayed silent and I laughed at him and just turned away, a few weeks later I was fired if you think I should have reported him and the company I did but keep in mind this is Bolivia, there is no justice for anyone who doesnt have money so until today I havent been able to get another stable job and we basically just live with the food our families give us and small jobs I got and everything goes to pay the bills, on top of this, about a year and a half into our relationship when we moved in together and a month before getting fired we got a loan from the bank to began a business together and when she was set to go and make a deposit to buy our merchandise her uncle got notice of this and robbed her like a common thief yeah you read that right, so we went into debt with no job and no business, police and family where notified but the scumbag flew the country to Peru as far a we know. My wife knows about my rape and thanks to her I was able to talk to my sister about it too, needless to say I broke my sisters heart but also made us closer, she also was kind enough to pay for private professional help for me and her to deal with this, I also opened about this with an uncle my mothers brother who I thought was someone completely different to what he turned out to be, when I told him about the rape he broke hard and I took him to talk with the therapist I was seeing thanks to my sister, and what she told me before the therapist and told to him later changed everything, she said that I needed some sort of compensation for what had happened in order to move on, it wasnt possible to get legal justice due the time frame of the events and the lack of evidence beyond my word and she didnt suggest anything more beyond that we should try to figure it out, of course telling the whole family was my first thought and let the truth have its day, but my uncle mothers brother begged me not to tell anything because it would destroy the family, specially my mother who has a lot, and I mean a lot of love for the uncle who raped me, she my mother basically raised him the first 4 years of his life because his parents had a busy and privileged life and he the rapist is seen by the rest of the family as a great guy and an example, with this he mothers brother convinced me not to tell anything, I know I could have just said no and told everything to everyone but thinking what could I possibly put my mother through after seeing how his brother took the news made me feel trapped and basically Ive been living feeling like a prisoner and the responsible for my entire family being together or not.",

    "Stuck between moving forward and killing myself Though I dont see the point of putting in all this effort to do things if it doesnt make me happy. I dont even have the energy or motivation for it. Every time I hear someone say Move on!, Man up!, Do this or do that, I already feel the pressure and it cripples me. Its not even that I dont want to do it. I really want to live a good and healthy life, but its like I am incapable of doing so. Seeing other people getting further in life also paralyzes me as well as watching vids on how to improve myself. Everything just scares me and paralyzes me. Still, I know its the only way out of this and my only chance of ever getting her back. However, there is no guarantee Ill get her back. So that thought is depressing on its own. And dont get me wrong. I know there are other girls out there. That is not the problem. I am not ugly and I can date girls, and I have done so for months already. I have had bad dates and great dates, and I have met great girls I could picture a relationship with, but it simply doesnt do it for me. I want my ex. Even when I put all the emotions aside and try to rationalize it, then I still want her. Right now I just feel trapped. Moving forward wont make me happy. It is not enough. Though sitting still and doing nothing wont make me happy either. At this point, suicide seems like the only solution, but even that is a scary and hard thing to do. However, I feel its the right thing to do as I feel far too broken and useless to continue this unsatisfying life. I wish there was some magical solution. I wish my ex would give the benefit of the doubt. I wish she would give me another chance. I wish she would make that sacrifice to help me. Though I know that that is ridiculous. I know that I have to do it all by myself that it is my responsibility... but I cannot do it anymore.",

    "I have no idea about anything anymore. I just feel so numb to the world. Im constantly fatigued and apathetic to others. I only want to talk to my late fiancées family and a few of my professors. Everyone else just takes too much space in my head to make any sense. My therapist is getting me to switch therapists since hes retiring but I really liked him and I feel bad for it, but Im resistant to getting a new therapist. I dont want to be. I have no friends and a very hard time making friends. Im tired of my parents shit. I never got to grieve my fiancées death properly and it ruins my life even now. I feel so, so lost. I am directionless. All I have is a career goal but everything else has fallen apart and Im just so fucking tired all the time about fucking everything. I want to just play video games but its so hard to get any time to myself with my parents blowing up my phone 247. I just want to be free and I want my fiancée back. Its all too much.",
    "Need motivation to continue what I love Hey all, Ive been so stressed out ever since I stopped drawing a year ago. It makes me feel horrible when I see my favorite artists post, almost jealous because Im not as good as them. My mental health has ruined how I perceive my drawings and I can never finish a sketch without feeling depressed. Today I want to start over and get back into things. I dont really have anyone to support me, so I hope it doesnt sound pathetic when I ask for it here.",
    "I am so tired I have entered this on a different subreddit, but no one seems to be too responsive besides one person who I am really thankful for. I want to hear more from others.... Im a very introverted person, and Im smart. I know what I should do to get help, I know what the sources of my problems are, I know what I have to do. But I am so tired. To make a long story short, I was emotionally, physically, verbally, and sexually abused for the first eleven years of my life, and now I am adopted by my godparents, who I highly respect as my mother and father. Anyways, like I said, Im a private person. This means people say things to me without thinking how I might feel about it. I also do not share my past memories with others I need to move on. I cannot blame them for their ignorance, that would be rude. So when people get mad, and yell at me, I leave my face blank and take it. But its been hard lately. When my mom gets upset with me, practically anything that leaves my mouth is talking back or an excuse. It makes me feel like her scolding me about being ungrateful means I dont deserve what she gives me that I dont deserve a loving mother, I deserve what I had, and that my feelings are excuses. But I take it, and I bounce back. Those outside of family know me as a happy, innocent, smart, and responsible person. If I am ever anything except some state of happy, people think its weird of me. Because I always get back on my feet without them knowing I fell. But I am so tired of getting back up. Of forgiving everyone that has hurt me over and over. Of taking all of those offensive comments silently. Of fulfilling the expectations of those around me when I already expect perfection out of myself. Of trying to put effort into my appearance only to look at my own hands and feel revolted. Of acting. Of not feeling good enough for anyone.I sometimes wish I had a normal life, but look back on it and would rather it be me than anyone else. And I want someone to see that.",
    "Eating. (Tw) I can barely eat 2 meals a day anymore. Today I had nothing for breakfast, a cookie for lunch and a few slices of pizza and a few chips for dinner. My family keep putting food infront of me but I always say Im not hungry. I cant tell Im loosing weight but apparently my family can. I cant help it. I exercise for hours a day and eat little food. I feel like fainting alot of the time. But I dont want people to find out I havent been eating so I eat tiny amounts, and then continue on. I drink tea to get me through the day. Im constantly tired, cold and angry all the time. I dont know whats happening to me. A few months ago I would look at people who said they mentally couldnt eat and say they were stupid, but now Im the person I called stupid. I guess it started when I found out I was transgender. I started working out because I hated my body. As time went on, I started to work out more. And as more time went on I started to eat less and less. Help me. I cant stand it. But I cant stop. No matter how much I want to eat and be healthy. I cant. My mind wont let me.",
    "I don't know what to do at this point other than end it. Nothing has helped so far. He then insisted that if I did that, he wouldnt love me anymore. I was terrified of being abandoned by the love of my life, and sex was the only form of intimacy I knew at this point, so I didnt want to lose the only things I cared about. I kept doing it for him. It would make me cry and have panic attacks and occasionally throw up, but he didnt stop. I kept telling him that it was okay because I didnt want him to leave me. I developed severe anorexia because of this. I havent told anyone about it because I dont want professionals to get rid of it. Its a comfort for me I need to be as skinny as possible. I cannot be fat or I will kill myself. I also dont have time to be hospitalized for something like this right now. I am in the midst of scholarship applications and making money for college. Now that I am skinny, I am severely paranoid that he loves me less and doesnt like the way that I look. He has admitted both of those things. When hes in a bad mood, hell insult me about how Im not sexually good enough for him anymore and that my body is ugly because Im so skinny. I dont feel good enough, because I clearly am not. He reassures me that he still loves me personality and my face but frankly thats really shitty, if you ask me. The fat fetish thing doesnt happen anymore, but Im not good enough for him now. Im too scared to leave though. He has been my best friend for like, a decade. I dont want to lose what weve had. This is the biggest problem I face right now aside from the abuse I endure from my mom. This is the reason I had attempted suicide, both times. I was drugged and violently raped at a party by one of my friends at 16 while everyone was sleeping. I dont really want to talk about that one. It was just rape, I guess. Uncomfortable situation. It was the least emotionally taxing of the three, though. I have CPTSD.",
    "My life is meaningless, and I’m struggling really hard with pain and emptiness. Anyone feel the same way...? Every day is just bleh. I have no purpose, no reason to live, so every day ends up feeling empty. I dissociate heavily all the time, so it feels like my life isnt even mine anymore, in the passenger seat of my own body, as if my strange hands and floating disembodied voice dont belong to me. I dont recognize the stranger in the mirror. I want to cry with every ounce of my being, but I just cant, no matter how hard I try. There is no release. Basic personal hygiene requires so much mental energy that it just ends up getting neglected entirely. How can I think about brushing my teeth when I dont even want to get out of bed? Hell, when I dont even want to wake up? Its all way too much to put into words, and this post is already pretty long. Sorry for rambling. Thanks for making it to the end of this novella.",
    "I'm sick of how everybody treats me and the way my life is going I am 16 years old and I live with my entire family. Every day I am screamed at for not automatically going to cut wood or do the dishes and other chores. I am called lazy by my parents and my younger brother. I started to play video games because as a child I was never allowed any type of electronic and I was extremely curious. Because of how my family treated me I started playing more and more video games and it became the one thing that I actually felt motivated to do. I began lying to my parents about what I was doing and when my school gave me a MacBook with special programs in it because I have ADDI played video games on that. I became addicted and still am. My parent filmed me on a camera and now all my homework must be done in front of a camera. I am just sick of how everything in my life is falling apart. My parents made a contract for me to sign about the rules of the house. I signed it. There are special things like, finish all homework get 30 mins of screen time. There are also stupid rules like at lunch no tv, only homework. My parents want me to do exercise but I am already 6ft1 and 150 pounds. They scream at me when I want to use my 30 mins of screen time after I have done my homework. On weekends I sleep for 14 hours and I just feel like I am in a constant cycle of screaming and pain. My parents threatened me with violence and to take me out of my dream school. I worked very hard to get in. My life is horrible and I am considering just giving up on everything and ending it. My parents have said that I wouldnt kill myself because I am too lazy and that nobody would come to my funeral because they wouldnt have one. Please help me. ampx200B ampx200B ampx200B I am a boy",

I seem to be subconciously selfpunishing myself for everything that I view as a flaw. I dont know what hobbies I could do, It really frustrates me that I dont know what makes me happy anymore. I feel that my sister doesnt truly support me in my gender transistioning even though she keeps saying she does. It seems like her and I just have different love languages Hers is gift giving and mines is words of affirmation , and so it makes me feel like her vibe is inconsistent and that frustrates me even more. I have been constantly feeling terrible about myself and others, but I primarily take it out on myself because I dont want to hurt other people with my emotions. I am very tired of feeling like I dont like myself and I want to care about myself...but I dont really know how. My parents basically told me that I evolved backwords, I was a very happy kid that could do quite a lot when I was a child, but now as an adult I hesitate, I close down, I feel like a shell of my former self.

    "My boyfriend had recently self harmed, and this has triggered me The entire time my 24yo boyfriend and I 21F have been together, he has always suffered with depression and anxiety. He has his good periods and bad periods, and I learnt how to deal with both. Hes off anti depressants, and hasnt been to therapy in a while. Until a few days ago, hes only ever told me about his urges, but has never actually self harmed. Then one morning, he told me he had cut himself, and how he was sorry and was really ashamed he had done it. I was supportive towards him, let him cry, and made sure he was okay. But after I had dealt with this, the thoughts of self harm seem to have become more frequent in my head. I have dealt with recurrent self harm thoughts in the past, but I havent suffered with them recently. I hope that I never act on these, but if I did I fear that he would blame himself, or think that I acted out to be like him. Im just confused.",

Would love to go see Jumanji next level which lead her it felt like to start over thinkinking. Whats that movie? Whos the Rock? Oh Him!... Theres two? I thought they made only one? Something about video game esk movies being a product for addhd melenials with apreciation for the art of a good movie. Even though she loves the original StarWars...and how about this depressing movie instead? no Gosh youre such a pill! I guess I made the mistake of comenting how I just like sometypes of movies but not others. I like uplifting ones, and also like funny ones. Just didnt want to see Knives out, or a nature documentarywhich did look excelent, just not in the mood to see it. That lead to fun drama. about being picky ? ??? and now its made things hard for her to treat me to movies and gosh she thought itd be fun etc. But as a back up plan she happened to have some cardgames. Meenwhile Oh. My. God. Both my parents and her taking turns tag teaming how really need to get off cymbalta because its becoming netorius for adding weight. and how my therapist is so evil, and by the way so is big pharma.

Today somehow the topic of being sad came up amp I was like why would you be sad again? amp he responded with because it always relapses. Thats how depression works. amp I was speechless. I understood that he used to have breakdowns they all, 23 in total, included something that was about me. but I never guessed that hed have depression. Im a generally very happy person amp Im not sure how to deal with this. I dont think hes professionally diagnosed because I do remember him saying it feels like hes depressed but never said he was diagnosed. I dont want to doubt him but at the same time I dont think what hes feeling is something as severe as depression. I dont know what to do. Should I just support him either way? If so, how am I supposed to support someone when theyre having depressing episodes?",
    "Am I depressed? *trigger warning* I, 23 Male have been feeling weird FOR YEARS. I dont really know if Im depressed or not because I have never been to therapy and probably never will because Its hella expensive from where Im from. I dont want to selfdiagnose my depression because I just find that weird and wrong. I was 12 when I first harmed myself, I dont think I did it a lot but back then, I just thought I was just influenced with the whole emo phase a lot of people my age then was so into. I had a few attempts growing up, and thats when I started thinking maybe I really am depressed, because even If i didnt do it constantly throughout the years since I first did it, there would be days where I thought dying would just be the best option because I felt so shitty all the time. I googled the symptoms of depression as I grew older and would relate to most of it, BUT i still could not find myself to think that I am depressed since I have not even checked in with a professional. Today, I have been feeling so bad about everything, I could explain In details about my life but It wont be necessary for this post. Some days theres a reason for me to be sad, and some days I just dont know whats the root of my sadness. I would just feel like shit even though I had a great day, and I could never really point out WHY im sad and it frustrates me until I cry and just try to exhaust myself and sleep and hope that I feel better when I wake up.

    "In love with my best friend who doesn’t see me like that. So Iv known this guy for over two years now and the moment I met him I started to fall for him. We are both mid 30s and have a real connection. We actually met from a online hook up at the beginning and he ended up staying here for a few nights, but after a week when I asked him for a date he said he wanted to stay friends as that was more important. I still remember how much it broke my heart then when he rejected me, but we hung out nearly every day. He stayed at my place most of the time and we just became really close. We sleep together whenever we stay at each others places, just cuddling. Over the years I have fallen deeper for him and I had already suffered with my own mental health before all this but now I feel so torn. He is literally my one and only friend, Im terrified of having another talk about my feelings with him in case I push him away again. We didnt speak for a few months as he wasnt very understanding that I couldnt stop loving him. I cried every single day when we stopped talking and this was during lockdown last year. It was awful, I think about him all the time and I have a lot of trouble sleeping with my mind just racing. Mostly When Im with him I genuinely feel myself and happy, but then I always wish for more. I dont know what to do, I feel like if i stepped away again from our friendship I wouldnt last. Its not that I want to end my life, but for awhile now I just wish I was dead. He keeps me tethered here, so I dont know do I just hide my feelings and say nothing and hope the friendship works. I would have been a very outgoing, proactive and positive person but I dont feel that anymore. I burst out crying a few times a day about my life, I dont really sleep, I cant really eat which isnt good cause Im already v skinny. Over the past few years Iv lost many friends to suicide so I know how terrible it is, but lately I really find myself understanding why they did it and tbh I dont have the guts to go through with it.",
    "My depressed partner drains me tldr My partner has been depressed and not knowing what to do with his life for a long time. I am the only person he relys on for support and I cant bear it any longer. It starts to severely affect my own life quality and happiness. I 30f met my partner 32m at university eight years ago. He was a very fun, open and active guy with a huge social group. After two years of being friends we started dating. It was around that time that he was done with all his courses and papers and the only thing left for him to finish uni was to write his bachelors thesis. That didnt happen for another four years. Within that time he basically didnt do anything. Didnt write his thesis, didnt get a job. He told me, that he had no clue, what he wants to do with his life and I tried to encourage him to just do some internships to figure that out, but he never did. He is fortunate enough that his parents pay for his expenses always did and still do, so money wouldnt be the problem. He never did any internship. Fast forward six years and the situation is still the same. He did eventually finish his bachelors and started a masters degree but realized that studying just isnt for him. However he still isnt properly searching for jobs or internships or general input that would help him figure out, what he wants to do or be. The thing is, that his self esteem is lower than the mariana trench. He feels like he doenst know anything and is underqualified for basically every job. Hes not. Hes incredibly smart, attentive and detail orientated and has a great passion for social justice but he keeps telling himself that he isnt enough for any job and he doenst dare to apply. I dont know how to help him. All my affirmations seem to not penetrate his mindfog. However, the problem is that Im the only one hes talking to. Because he realized that all his peers moved on he stopped having contact with them because he was embarassed. So here is the thing.",

    "I'm so tired I remember the next day where during all of class I lied in bed, not saying a word to the friends I usually talk to all day, it just all felt so hopeless. That night I remember asking my mom to look into therapy again then went upstairs and lied on the floor of my room for a half hour crying and trying to vent out what I was feeling, but everytime I talked about it I was too scared to fully explain to my friends, leaving it coming off as a student wanting to be lazy rather than sheer hopelessness and a severe lack of any will to keep living they it really was. I took the AP exam yesterday on my birthday, it was fine enough but left me wondering why I even did that, why did I go through all that stress and mental fatigue to look kind of good for colleges? I was tired, tired and done with dealing with this. So here I am a year later, lying in bed with no will or motivation to do anything else. Behind on my school work, and vastly unprepared for an SAT coming up in a few days, just wondering when will it be better. I dont want any of this anymore, I just want to sleep, Im so tired of everything, Ive been burnt out for months with no end in sight, why wont I feel better? I have a test for my drivers license coming up next week too, which cause me to again spiral and type all this, when does it end? Will I ever be just content with life? Im tired of it all, why wont it get better? When will it end? Is there even a way to cope anymore?",

    "I don’t know how I should feel My life has been weird recently. Some good things have happened, but also some shit things have happened. For example, I managed to put on weight which is incredible, and I am now eating 3 meals a day up from one and a snack when I was at uni. Also, Ive managed to reconnect with some old friends from school, which I didnt think would ever happen. But on the flip side, people I cared about have decided to leave my life over the last few weeks, using either their own or my mental health as their reasoning. Ive also had an ex who cheated on me and sexually assaulted me try reenter my life by messaging some of my friends. At the minute, Im feeling as down as ever. I have reasons to, but I also have reasons not to. So, I cant help thinking I shouldnt be feeling this or thinking like this and beating myself up about it. I think I should be happy, but I just never seem to be. I dont really know how to think or how I should be feeling anymore. I dont know what to do about all this, Ive used all the counselling my uni offered me, and also some from a trade union. I cant afford to go private, so thats now out of the picture.

    "My mom said I'm faking depression Hey everyone, Ive never posted here but I hope youre all well. I really need some advice if you have any. I go to one of the top universities in North America and am currently in my 5th year. These past 2 years have had me feeling really low and Ive been thinking about seeing a therapist because I may have depression. I feel very demotivated and tired even though my work load is insane and I cant afford to slack. Often times I feel very worthless, a burden, and a waste of space. I also binge eat which makes those feelings worse. The eating has gotten a LOT better but it still had its moments. Anyway, Ive been wanting to sew a therapist but I need insurance which had been kind of holding me back. My dads insurance covers the whole family I live at home, for cultural reasons but he and my mom would be able to see who uses it. After a year, the feelings got worse and I made the decision, after much deliberation, to tell my mom that I would like to see a therapist and that I would like to use the insurance. She said okay and j started looking but most were fully booked or not taking new patients. Today, we were discussing my sisters divorce. Her ex had depression and was one of the reasons they got a divorce. My mom says that anyone who has depression shouldnt get married, and that it applies to me. She said that she thinks Im faking it for attention because its not visible to her. She said if I do think I have it, I should forget about finding love or getting married. I interpreted her words to mean that people it depression are unworthy of love and that I would ruin someones life like my sisters ex ruined hers.

My best friend is a girl who Ive fallen in love with so hard that I would literally give anything just to see her happy. But she doesnt feel the same way towards me and I dont want to leave her as Im the person she turns to whenever she has a depressive episode. If I ended my life she would be left with nobody and Im scared for what would happen to her, but I know she wont ever need me the way I need her and that thought itself is one of the reasons why I feel so down. I dont think Im ever going to love anyone to the extent I love her so whats the point of living if Im never going to be able to feel emotion to that same level.

    "I'm nothing without my medication. Hey, im Bradley. Im turning 16 close to the end of this year. This years exams that are upcoming are really, really important and will determine my near future. Its stressful, but I always avoid getting stressed. Heres where the first problem comes in when im not stressed, I dont worry about the exams. So in the end, theres completely no effort when the day comes. Medication started about a month or two ago. So far, ive missed some days and yes, my psychiatrist knows. I wont elaborate on my problems but basically I have been diagnosed with depression after close to 3 years of suffering in silence. And it has been tough. Seeking help didnt relieve me that much, but it did. My mood changed a little, im kind of more positive in terms of my everyday life. Just school, sports and home. A cycle. Everytime theres signs which are triggers, but im afraid of telling my teachers or psychiatrist because im just too scared to im always getting into that depressive episode. I get easily angry, especially to my friends and I tend to be impulsive during these anger moments. Its tough dealing with depression. Really tough. Medication just makes it seem like I cant handle things on my own, and drugs are needed just for my mood to get better I mean, when I was a child it was so easy to be happy, why not now?. I seem to never forget that without medication id be dead. I dont know if I should see it that way or whether I should take things on my own. Its masculinity, right? If we could handle this, were stronger than others, right? People always tell us that itd be better if they understood what I was going through, but must I really tell _everyone_ that I have depression?",

    "Overthinking is killing me I have always been shy, and was recently diagnosed with severe social anxiety. I have also been depressed for about 3 years now, after I had been bullied by some  friends  in middle school, 7th grade. 8th grade was even worse, I had lost all my friends, and had turned into a loner. My freshman year was the same, and the teachers even started to pick on me. Thats when I left, and decided to stay at home and do online school. Both of my parents are hard working, so they couldnt stay home with me, so I had absolutely no motivation at all to work on school, and barely passed. I am now a Sophomore and only have online friends. I overthink EVERYTHING to the point where I cant even text my friends online anymore, because I worry I will say something weird. It has never gotten this bad, I used to be funny, and I didnt overthink as much. I was almost outgoing. I dont know what to do. Ive tried talking to a few therapists before, but it has never helped and i am not sure about any medications. It is really hard for me to post this, but I need some help.",
    "I was too close to hurt myself In the past few days Ive been hit hard with my depression. For me sadly it doesnt have to be triggered and it just happens. Yesterday morning I thought I was getting better but as the day passed it just got worst. After not eating for the entire day I went and got some food. I was such a mess and I just stared at the knives and picked one up and pressed it against my arm. I repeated it a few times and I got too tempted but managed to put it back. Afterwoards I broke down crying cause its a thought I hadnt had for years and I didnt selfharm for years and now out of nowhere I was so close to doing it out of nowhere. Im glad I didnt do anything but at the same time I feel so sad I almost did. I hope you have a good day today thank you for reading",
    "People who don't have school/work: what do you do? For the people out there who arent in school and dont work, what do you do with your time? And I know it sounds like Im being rude, but I really want to know. Long story short, Ive been in college for a few years with worsening depression. Its likely that Im going to take a leave of absence because its become painfully clear to me that I cant handle school. I dont want to leave school, but I made exactly zero progress towards my degree this semester and its a massive waste of money to stay in school at my current mental state. Im in the middle of trying a new antidepressant my sixth in about three years and my current plan is to move home for the upcoming semester so that I have time to figure out treatment because trying a new antidepressant takes like three months and if this medication isnt the one, then thats another quarter of the year down the drain. But Ive been trying to figure out what Ill do with all my time and... I find myself drawing a blank. Sure, Ill be trying medications and going to therapy, but thatll take a couple hours per week at the absolute maximum. I can try to exercise, but again, thats maybe an hour out of my day if I can find the energy to do it. The rest of the time, I have absolutely no idea what to do other than watch Netflix and YouTube and go on Reddit, all things which I know are bad for my mental health and make me feel even more like I have no sense of purpose. I dont think I can handle getting a job maybe on a parttime basis, but Im not sure if I can deal with even that. My family has dogs, so Ill take care of them, but still, I anticipate having hours and hours of time in which I have to entertain myself alone. tldr Im going to leave school temporarily, but I dont know what Ill do with all my time other than mindlessly browse the Internet. For those of you who dont go to school or work, what do you do with your day? What gives you a sense of structure and purpose?",
    "How do you date while depressed? I really want to start dating, but I dont know how to tell people about my depression or just the shittyness of my life in general. I feel like I have nothing to offer I dont speak to my family anymore, I dont really have any hobbies anymore, Im about to drop out of school, I have really bad anxiety.... the only thing I have is my physical appearance. I deserve happiness so I do want to date, but it all just feels really unfair towards the other. I dont want to start dating someone just for them to find out after a month or something how big of a mess I am and then either leave or stay out of pity. But I also dont know how to let people know in advance without sounding really pathetic or attention seeking. I dont really want to wait until Im better, because that will take years and years and years due to my trauma. But I also dont want to just spring my baggage onto a stranger who didnt ask for it and isnt prepared for it. Does anyone know how to tread this needle?",
    "what's the best messages to send to someone who is depressed but not replying back I probably should just drop the ball on my friend but I wanna try to reach out. I typically have deeper talks w her and she leaves me on read, shes kind of ignoring me when I ask mundane things too. even the funny memes maybe she doesnt find it funny are seen but not replied to. not sure what to say or do, and I know times are dull for everyone but I just want my friend to message me back, even if its a leave me alone, pocket.",
    "I suffer from persistent depression and my GF wants to leave me. Last night she told me she did not see a future for us in that way. My sombreness, some of my anxiety fueled behaviour and display of a victim mentality hurt her and have crossed certain boundaries. She meant to tell me this before, even left some breadcrumbs via text. I only noticed her pulling away, losing interest or giving me the silent treatment. I could have guessed this was on her mind but maybe I was to scared to have a talk. I feel sad that she has been dealing with this for a while and how difficult that must have been. She told me that shed given me the benefit of the doubt a couple of weeks ago but never mentioned this to me like so. I do feel her way of going about this, her communication could have been better. But then again this must have been difficult and she told me that it felt like abandoning me. I am so caught up in my current mental state that I have trouble going about things. Like litterarly doing anything some days or going somewhere on time is hard, and I hate that! Dealing with my thoughts, anxiety and all that other crap made lose myself my self worth and the man I wanted to be. But ive crossed her boundaries and I completely understand why she did not want this situation anymore. She told me she still loves me and does not want to give up on me. She recognises this is my situation and that I am not the guy she fell in love with right now. She needs some time to find herself and I need to get a grip on my situation.. I want to improve my communication and our communication. I want to manage my outbursts better. I want to manage my anxiety better. I want to regain my self confidence and self worth. I want to stop this victim mentality, I hate it! I want to regain trust and to reconnect. I could really use some advice and would love to have your input or experiences. TLDR Dealing with a bad depression episode that changed us and my relationship. She can not take things anymore and wants out, how can I improve things?",

Like I said before, everything has start at all early 2019 I guess. I start to imaginating me fucking with some people especially my nieces one is a kid and another a baby and I cumming on it. This impacted me...you now? Suicide. But this happen to another people why this impacted me? I imaginated me having a pee pee on my friends girlfriend. Have a period of time that I imaginated people without their eyes. Actually has periods that I had fear of becoming blind. I dont if is because I have made jokes about a friend that have one eye blind. He have his moments of stupid speech but this dont justified what I have done. Have a time that I watched Gotham 2014 that Is a tv show. There is a Joker on the series, and for a period I wanted to be him, kill people you know? Why? Why? Why? Have a time in mid 2018 that I was in conflict religiously. I wanted to know that If god or satan really exist. I guess that Ive prayed for my mom die? Ive prayed to rain? For both? You know now Im in conflict with the numbers 12 and 18. My nieces have been born in years that ends there. I dont know what to do. I am racist? I cant have a relationship with women. Well, once I was masturbating and when I was going to thought the name of my niece. Once I was watching porn and remembered of the name of father of my friend. It happens with one of nieces too.",
    "How do I gauge the success of my antidepressant without knowing what the “best case scenario” actually feels like? At this moment in time, I am on 60mg prozac a day. I just cant seem to stop wondering about how to know when I have found the correct prescription. It has been a few months of increasing the dose and Id like to believe it has been helping me, but I cant tell if its all in my head or if it is just coincidence I have been having one or two good days a week instead of none. prozac is the only antidepressant I have been prescribed over the years, and while I am hesitant to try something unfamiliar, the idea that there might be a more effective medication crosses my mind frequently. I struggle greatly with low energy levels motivation fatigue and it would suck to know that all of this time I could have been pursuing a prescription that was a better fit. I feel like I have been making decisions blindly simply because I dont have the experience of another antidepressant to compare the effectiveness.",

    "I kill myself if you don’t read My upbringing only perpetuated my depression. My single mom never gave me responsibilities and I had too much free time. Making it worse I was a nerd so having the option to just stay inside and play video games was heaven. Years went by without speaking with anyone or trying to build relationships. In my teen years that was basically suicide because who wants to be known as the loner. So I would skip days to keep my fragile ego safe. Thoughts go by in my head that if I could just at the very least get over my fear for rejection I could get my life in order. Because having an intimate relationship would really solve a lot of current issues I have. And so Im actively looking subconsciously and consciously because i am starving for intimacy. I know how that would look desperate maybe a bit crazy. And its not about sex its about completely being open and honest with another person. I feel I can only be this intimate with a girl and refuse to open up to such an extent to the access of other human beings in my life. Because the human being in my life were not driven by choice ie family, childhood friends Im in a pickle and it sucks, but if it wasnt for weed I would not be aware of my issues, stayed positive and attempt to help myself. This is only a recent discovery ever since joe Rogan started talking about how weed paranoias actually help you figure out what is actually stressing you out. Thats the worst about depression, every action you do against yourself feels justified and logical. Its truly a terrible disease and I hope I survive this. Sorry about title Im just so desperate I apologize for my existence.",
    "Step son quit working &amp; refuses help My stepson has some undiagnosed mental issues along with anxiety and depression. A couple months ago he lost his job because he wasnt showing up to work. I know he makes a few dollars here and there but Im not sure how. He never leaves his house and he refuses any help mans mother offer him unless my wife just offers to give him cash. We have learned that he has been doing some sort of drugs off and on for several years. About a year and a half ago we had to spend a lot of money to get his house out of foreclosure because he hadnt been paying the bills. I know he isnt paid his mortgage and several months now so at some point theyre going to foreclose on him and kick him out. Im just not sure what to do. When he stays with us he argues with his mom NonStop if she even asks him to take a shower. He doesnt clean up after himself and when you goes to the bathroom he makes a huge mess. Its hard for me to even think about living with that. But if I tell her he cant stay here if hes not working or showering or cleaning up after himself, she just says that shes afraid hell be homeless or kill himself. Any advice?",

The last year of my life I have been battling with severe depression and anxiety, and was just recently hospitalized for a week in a psychiatric ward. At this point, I feel so incurable nothing has helped. I have seen my therapist for a year, seemed professional medical help, took the numerous amount of pills and have not felt the slightest bit better. Things have gotten worse than before. I have laundry piling up in the corner of my room and at this point I just pull out any clean clothes I can find in my dresser. Showers? HA even a short 5 minute shower seems to take too much energy at this point. AND I AM SO SICK AND TIRED OF HEARING THE SAME BULLSHIT LINES OF It will get better, and You have nothing to be depressed about, or Everything will be fine because it always works out. To be honest, my depression has just spiraled out of control at this point. I cant look at myself in the mirror and hate everything about myself internally, externally and mentally. I hate myself and the people I am hurting. I could have a good day, but at the end of the day my suicidal thoughts still sit in the back of my head. Sometimes I sit and regret not just doing it blade to my wrist and a family member walks in. I had the blade in my right hand, resting on my left forearm and I regret not ending my life there when I had the motherfucken chance.",

    "My friends left me, whats wrong with me and how do I fix it? After about 6 months I got fed up with this so I wrote him a essay on how ghosting and making only rude comments isnt nice and that I was sort of hurt that he was doing this. He then responded, Oi calm down. Too where I got more mad calling him out for the crap hes been doing, only to get the response, Cringe. We eventually got into a call around the same time, too where he said that he didnt care about me and he ghosted me because he felt like it. A few months later, some of my friends wanted to inv him to a discord server, I was a little not that into it, but I felt that maybe he would be more mature and would be my friend again or smth dumb like that. After my friends had messaged him, he messaged me, Cringe. I asked him, Dude what the hell. Too where he said, Yknw its been a few months, I used too think that you were just a joke or a little game, but now your weird and kinda cringe. Then blocking me. This all happend in about the same time in august 2020. I mean I dont know if Im being silly but it really really hurt me, and I dont wanna be on some kid on r Im14andthisisdeep.

What if Im just being ridiculous and Im really that bad like she said? I know this is really long and all but Ive just been looking for some help I guess. Of course Ive made other friends after this or tried to make contact with other kids that Ive known previously, but Im always like the one person who you want to stop messaging you.

So on so forth I have no interest in studying anymore, Im not good at that. Everyone been pressuring me to get an A even though I cant get a C. My family doesnt have much money and is very strict, my father doesnt allow me to work, study first. I know that I will work a minimum wage job and I know he cares about me The only upside about me is that I like to try things and get the experience, I tried many things from coding, stock, drop shipping, making my own face cream, cooking, farming, exercise etc. Im more interested in those type of things than studying but I know none of those things matter if I dont have any capital so to get capital I need a job or win lottery somehow. Also I like writing suicide notes  Im an idiot I know that, guy that cant even passed my highschool exam. Guy that doesnt learn from previous mistake. Ive been suicidal this year because everything is going downhill. I have just started stock trading recently with 800 dollar and I have lost 500 dollar already. Last month I was able to make atleast 20dollar perday for 2week for now I have been losing 20 dollar a day around that amount.

Ive been in therapy several times, and have been on antidepressants and antianxiety meds for 3 years. Ive always thought my depression was situational, and Ive worked really hard to change my life for the better. The past 612 months have been the best Ive ever felt, as such I made the decision to start trying to come off my antidepressants. My GP advised to take the pill on alternative nights which Ive been doing for the past few weeks.

I feel like I have fucked up my life so bad, who knows if I will be able to recuperate. I dont have friends, the only person I speak with is my mother, I live alone, work sucks, not implicated with anything because I cant keep a commitment. I just feel really lost.

A white Christmas is great. I like chucking a snowball at my boyfriend. And hot chocolate is my favorite. However, why is it so fucking dark? Sunset at 5? Are you kidding me? Im exhausted, time confused, miss the sun, and I swear to God if it rains again at 40 degrees, Im hibernating for the rest of the year. I hate driving in the dark. I have to go outside to get to the basement to do my laundry, which thanks to last nights snow, means going through an inch and half of snow, on top of cold mud, into a rocky cold basement at the bottom of some rickety ice covered steps, just to put something in the washing machine. We have multiple cats, so I have to dump cat boxes daily, which makes a daily run to the trashcan, now in the dark. Driving in the dark. I hate how dark it is. I hate that it looks like midnight at 6 pm. Its just absurd. How do you all survive winter without living in a cocoon of blankets on the bed? Side note, yes I am aware of S. A. D.

Ive done talkcognitive therapy for years, but at this point medication is going to be necessary. The one psychiatrist in my area that was accepting clients had their partner retire and took on all of their patients and no longer had any appointments available.

    "Can someone help me? I am a 13 depressed and suicidal kid. I have been like this since the age of 11.i have no enjoyment for life whatsoever. My parents are strict so they want me to be at the top of my class. But since Ive fallen in this state, my grades have started to slip. My parents got really mad at me and made me work even harder. But its hard. I have zero motivation. I have failed. As a child, as a friend, as a student, as a person. I am too scared to tell my mom. I told my dad. He seemed to care for a week. Then he shomed no empathy. Back to a strict parent. My mom says depression isnt real. I havent told her. I just heard her while she was talking to her friend. They expect me to study 14 hrs a day and only play for 2 hrs on Sundays. I am hopeless. I am deciding if I should end it all or not",

    "What to expect when you share your mental health with your family? I recently shared some parts of my mental health with my family. So my question is this what should I expect them to behave after sharing this with them? My experience telling them wasnt pleasant and I dont know if Im at fault for sharing or if Im at fault for expecting a certain behavior. ampx200B Heres what happened I am 24, female. Ive had depression, anxiety, dissociation and derealisation for over 2 years now, probably had it before but it was only confirmed by a therapist two years ago because thats when I went to see whats wrong with me. ampx200B Nobody knows about this side of me but my ex girlfriend. So recently I told my mom I have anxiety. My family keeps showing at my house randomly to visit and stay for hours and that would cause panic attacks each time because I want expecting their visit or planned for it. So one day I burst and told my mom why Im always upset when they show up like that. all I expect is a call before hand to prepare myself mentally. ampx200B Ive told them about my dissociation and derealisation because they have been nagging for months wanting me to buy a car and drive instead of commuting and refusing to move to a house thats far from work. my mom lives with me so me driving is important to take her places I kept telling them Im not ready and I just need more practice. I took so many lessons and wasted over 1500 learning with no result to the extent I was kicked out of the driving lesson by my instructor because he thought my driving was dangerous So one day they said Im a coward and that I should just go and drive and not let my fear control me. So I shared the reason why I cant drive. They first said theres no such thing as what I mentioned and that I shouldnt diagnose myself with no knowledge. I told them I went to 3 therapist and they all confirmed this. After a moment of silence they said I shouldnt let this stop me from driving. I said no It should stop me because its a danger to my self and the people around me. My sister said ok seek help.",
    "I don’t have anyone to talk to and I don’t know what to do anymore Nine years ago I was diagnosed with depression and generalised anxiety disorder, Six years later I was also diagnosed with PTSD due to sexual assault trauma, and finally stopped living in denial and got a formal diagnosis plus started treatment for anorexia nervosa. my lifes kinda been a train wreck for the most part. I always remember being deeply sad with an overly critical and hateful view of the world around me human kind are doing nothing productive for the earth and it would be best if we walked hand in hand to extinction to save the planet kind of hateful or for some periods of time feeling like Im buzzing with happiness, in which times I felt unstoppable. With my first diagnosis, my first set of meds followed, I trialled quite a few over the years but when I decided they didnt work for me I tried self medicating with anything I could get my hands on and ended up with major substance abuse issues. Ive now just managed to get myself sober and maintain it for the last month. I feel as if Im being sucked into a giant pit of despair I cant get myself out of and Its progressively getting harder to leave bed. I get panic attacks before and during leaving the house because Im terrified someones going to hurt me. I only go out to get groceries and even then sometimes I get there, panic and cant leave the car so I just go home. I cant sleep properly anymore due to horrible nightmares. I can never shake the feeling that Im a giant burden to everyone in my life so I cant talk to them about when Im struggling. Ive isolated myself so much over the past few years I dont have a single friend left. Id like to try medication again but Im too terrified to try anything and have panic attacks thinking about taking something to shut up my mind in fear of getting addicted and out of control. Has anyone else struggled with this? What helped you overcome it?",

    "Any tips would be helpful I am 20f and have been struggling with depression and PTSD since I was 13 or 14 years old. Recently I developed a severe alcohol problem that I am trying really hard to beat. Without the old expectations of school, I find myself really unmotivated. I dont get out of bed until hours after I wake up and I have trouble finding a routine during the day. I live with my bf23 and he is very supportive but he works a lot. On the days that he is home, we do all kinds of things together and I will even wake up early to clean or make breakfast. But when Im alone, all that goes out the window and I dont even have the motivation to feed myself, brush my teeth, or much of anything.

    "Advice on how to deal/make progress The decision is made to up my sertraline dose to 150mg, although I note I am seeing a pattern of it stopping working every 3 years. They dont recommend therapy, as theyre not sure what to give me that I havent had already. The experiment with the 150mg doesnt go well, the sideeffects become really apparent and awful at this dose. We decide to discontinue and try something else. The psych recommends bupropion, but I have another idea in the mean time since Ive been reading the promising research on psilocybin which happens to be legal here. I try that once I am weaned off the sertraline and it works really well... for about 3 months. Then Im back to slipping into deep depression because its insufficient. I try the bupropion, but it doesnt agree with me. On day 4 I get a headache and malaise severe enough to knock me out completely for the day, and it feels like the skin on my head is on fire? That last one is extra worrying for me since I really dont want the alopecia that it can cause. I decide since its actually stopping me from doing social things I have left, I should discontinue. Thats where I am now. The situation is currently pretty bad, Im struggling to keep the suicidal ideation at bay. Im not actively under treatment of a psychiatrist at the moment, I would have to look for another referral. Obviously moving to a place where I actually have friends nearby would help, but even if I did find a house somehow, I am in no state to organise and execute a move. I honestly feel pretty bitter about society treats the less fortunate, Ive mostly just been left to deal with the consequences of austerity since the financial crash, the failing social housing policy, and the corona policies on top of that. Since Im not exactly clearheaded at the moment, Id like to know what youd do in my situation. I think I need another medication to try, or stick with bupropion for longer. But all of them are a mixed bag, with risks sexual dysfunction, or weight gain, or liver toxicity.",
    "How do I process a break up with depression and anxiety In April, I 25F blew up on my boyfriend 24M because his communication was extremely poor and he still had his dating apps. I kept mine to spy on him and until he finally deleted his. In November, he ghosted me because I blew up on him for being online on Badoo. we met on My trigger is rejection because I havent seen my father in 21 years. I get hysterical because I relive the abandonment and rejection over again I begged for him to come back and he did 3 weeks later. But, I always took the blame. He claimed that he used it to get weed. Fast forwards to April, the last time I saw him in person he got a notification from Bumble to come back and use the app. He told me he wasnt using it but I lost it and asked to see if he received a message but he wouldnt show me. Then, I asked him to delete all the apps on his phone. He claimed he couldnt get into Badoo because he needed to go through his email to get the password and it would take to long. Then, he didnt message me for over week, he does this all the time to me. He worked nights and it was a long distance relationship. All I wanted was how are you, good morning and good night text. I was always the one initiating the conversations. When i complained he would only communicate for 2 weeks and then stop. Also, he was never been there for me. After this point, I blew up, told him if he couldnt delete the rest of the dating apps and give me more communication or it was over. He never answered me back. Due to my depression trigger, I freaked out. I begged for him back again. He answered and was quiet again so I went to his house but never answered. After that, he stopped messaging me. Its been almost a month. I cannot sleep well even though Im on medication, I get panic attacks, have anxiety all the time about him replying back to me, being alone again, rejection and where my life is heading especially with this virus because I was suppose to move in with him.",
    "I dont have any reason to be sad I told my friends that I was feeling too sad to go out with them and they told me that I dont have any reason to be sad. That I dont have any problems or responsibilites. And I was kinda shocked, because... they just forgot about everything I told them? Long story short im broke, my relationship with my family destroyed, i literally dont speak to any of my family members anymore, my studies are killing me, I need to find job and im not even a citizen of a country I live in, I dont have permission to work. This week i fainted on street. And I told them that. I just... i dont get it. I feel so bad and they dont even notice? Like, for everyone everything is fine?

    "Stuck between moving forward and killing myself Some background information My GF of almost 3 years broke up with me over half a year ago and ever since I have been severely depressed. It wasnt a bad breakup, just a sad one. Shortly after the breakup, I noticed I wasnt dealing with it well at all. I couldnt do anything but cry and wishing she would come back. I went to a psychologist and he diagnosed me with Major Depressive Disorder MDD. I still had friendly contact with my ex, but I was just hoping she would come back. After an emotional call, she told me to take a few months for myself. And so I did, but I just got worse. I couldnt do anything. I stopped working, studying, playing sports, everything, because I had no energy or motivation for it. I almost got admitted to a psych ward, but it was still my choice to do stay there or not. I chose to not do it as I had a bad feeling about it. October of last year, I contacted her again and we met for the first time in months. It was supposed to just be friendly, but talking about the relationship was inevitable. She said to me she would never take me back. She wasnt angry, but just serious and honest. It broke me even more. The next day I sent her a goodbye text and was close to killing myself. She called just in time and we had a good talk. Though a few weeks later, when things look better and we actually had made plans to meet up as friends, I got a panic attack and sent her emotional texts. She sent me a long one back and then blocked me. I then attempted suicide again, this time getting hospitalized. I have not directly spoken to her since. It was either via other people or letters. Last December I sent her a suicide letter, but I quickly regretted it. My brother sent her a message for me, apologizing to her and telling her Im okay. Then for Christmas, I sent her a simple card, but never got a response nor did I expect one to be honest.",

And so, when I say I have to deal with a full time 95 monday to friday job, you can imagine how much trouble I am having getting through the day. Im taking things a second at a time, just trying to get through the next moment until the day is done. Its a good job, an easy job with nice people and good conditions, but I cant do it  I just physically cant do it a second longer. Its too much effort. Ive pushed myself to my limits and then some.

    "“I Don’t Care What You Think… This Is Between Me And God Now.” I have always looked up to my older cousin, Jim. He was truly one of the three men I admire most credit Don McLeans American Pie. And then, as if my current struggles with depression havent been bad enough, this week he tore me apart over a situation that he was completely ignorant about. He took one persons totally distorted version of events a diplomatic way of saying that he believed someone elses delusional lies and wouldnt even consider my side of the story. I tried so hard to get him to understand what I was doing and why. But he just wouldnt listen and continued to so very unfairly condemn me. Jim hurt me so badly. And he broke my heart. I was at a loss for what to do next. Then I thought about what my Dad would say in a similar situation. He wasnt a very big man physically, but he was one tough little SOB. And though he passed three years ago, I still find comfort and inspiration from his words of wisdom. So I told Jim that Ive given this situation a great deal of thought and prayer. Im doing what I believe is right. And if he doesnt like it, with all due respect, I dont care. This is between me and God now. Jim had no answer. And his abusive attacks stopped. Thanks Dad. I love you, man. And I miss you",

    "\"Paying for happiness\" - anyone else? It is as if my body and mind HAVE to revert back to a depressive norm, like a rubber band snapping back the higher I stray from it, the more intense the snapback. This is devastating, even as I have recognized the pattern and come to expect it. It literally feels like I am punished by my own bodymind for daring to experience happiness or joy. It feels like a cruel trick by the Universe every time, or like I have to pay the piper for not feeling depressed for one damn day. I have considered the possibility of bipolar disorder, but I really dont think thats it. Certainly yoyoing between joy and depression has that weird polarity, but the happiness is always caused by externals  a trip somewhere, quality time with friends, a great experience, etc. It doesnt just come out of nowhere. I really have to find and create the happiness. It is the punishment that has no rhyme or reason aside from following the pattern. It is inevitable even if nothing bad happens to bring me down  its just a crash, like a plane running out of fuel and dropping out of the sky. And while the happiness can feel euphoric sometimes, it doesnt feel like any kind of manic episode Ive heard or read about. It is more just the joy of feeling some goddamn unvarnished happiness for a little while. Does anyone else experience this? Any suggestions? !",
    "Is it possible to date when you're depressed? It feels really impossible to even attempt to find a partner when youre depressed.

I have severe depression and other mental health issues, so my feelings are quite bleh in general and Im basically asexualhave no libido for the last 6 years over something that happened thats too complicated to explain here.

    "Starting the fight I have been deep in depression and anxiety for a year or so. I am sick of it. I scheduled an appointment with a psychologist for Monday morning. Im ready to fight. Heres the big challenge I feel like I am stuck in mental and emotional quicksand. I feel so much resistance to everything and my brain is super foggy. I also lack motivation.

    "I need help Hey guys, so this may seem like a weird thing to need help with but Im just trying to figure out if Im actually depressed or if Im going through something else. Im nineteen and recently I just moved to another state for school and lately I havent been attending most of my classes and my grades are extremely bad right now. I just cant seem to get myself to go. Im just surprised because I have never done this before, its not like me to skip classes. Most mornings I just lay in bed until noon. I dont know if this is extreme laziness or something else. Im constantly in my head and Im extremely worried about my grades but am I really that worried if I keep skipping class? I also feel like I have a lot of anxiety when I have to be around a lot of people, especially ones I dont know. I know Im an introverted person but being an introvert doesnt mean that I have anxiety around a lot of people, I just prefer to be in a small group or by myself most of the time. I even get anxious when Im just walking to class or going to the grocery store my myself. I dont really feel happy most of the time, and I dont think Ive felt happy for a while. I can get temporary happiness by watching something funny or by reading a book since thats my favorite thing to do, but right after Im done Im right back to where I was. I dont understand what it is, I have loving parents and they have given me all I could hope for they are helping me financially by helping pay for my rent and by paying for the classes I am taking right now and yet I dont have the decency to even repay that by going to class. Im just not sure whats going on with me and if Im just being extremely lazy or if I am depressed.",
    "Living in Israel, as of today. Hi all, Im David, 30, born and raised in Israel. In the central region. This is the first time I write about my inner feelings, especially at these times outer war with Hamas in Gaza, and inner war with farright IsraeliArabs and Farright Jews. Im a happy person. Got a good job, great and supportive partner. I love living, curious on everything life has to offer. from baking, coffee, to movies and games, to travel and cultures around the world. Im keeping myself healthy with vitamins and doing Tim Ferriss 4 Hour Body diet and exercises. Not watching too much public television and getting some news oncetwice a day. Every day Im working from 9 to 6, ending with some different relaxation daily. For the last week, everything around me is changing. It has started with the famous issues in Jerusalem, and later started to go south. Sirens went off every evening, and woke us up every night between 1am and 3am, and also 7pm and 9pm. With every siren, we have 130min to get to a safe area. In that safe area, Im meeting every neighbor that lives around me, some elderly, some couples, and young families, which the mothers are crying out loud from the pressure. Once 130min have passed, we wait for the missiles to get hit by our irondome, or unfortunately fall. Yesterday one missile hit 5 kilometers from me. While this missiles and hits in Gaza is going on  inside the country, in cities where Arabs and Jews living together  theres literally an anarchy. If you look like a jew, orthodox mostly  youll get hit, kicked, and now will be shot. If you look like an arab, youll get hit, kicked, and probably be shot. There was not enough police to keep the area cool. Small groups in their hundreds, are traveling to these cities to protect their people. Jews, Arabs, it doesnt matter. synagogues burnt down, people being pull over and being hit by rocks. You need to identify in front of gangs if you are an arab or a jew. Either  youll be in grave danger. It needs ti be called a civil war non the less.",
    "Yesterday Was Rough To catch you up Ive dealt with depression, anxiety, and parasuicidal thoughts for over 30 years, since before I was 10. My wife and I are currently separated as we both deal with our individual issues with depression, anxiety, etc, as well as seek couples counseling. We have been married 8 years, together 10, and have a 2 12 year old son. ampx200B Last Friday, I was given an ultimatum at work. I am the director of advertising amp marketing for one of the largest independent automotive groups in the Southeast United States. I was told, in so many words, that I had a week to prove my worth or lose my job. Never mind that I have reduced our spending by 45 since I started, and brought in triple my salary in additional new business due to digital marketing efforts I implemented in the organization, all the while maintaining the original sales output of our business. I was given exactly zero direction as to how to prove my worth. Needless to say, the last week has only served to heighten my stress and anxiety. ampx200B Ive never been a very physically affectionate person. I get that from my mom, a survivor of sexual abuse when she was a child. But yesterday, I really needed a hug from my wife. I just wanted to hold her in my arms, breathe in her scent, and feel like everything was going to be alright. ampx200B I realize, cognitively, that this process is a good thing for our lives. We are on the road to personal healing and healing as a couple. But that doesnt make this season any easier, and a hug from my little boy doesnt do for me what one from my wife would.",
    "I don’t know how to help my depressed friend. Hello everyone, Ive come here for help or advice on what to do for one of my good friends. This might be long because theres a lot to unpack here. She19 has dealt with depression ever since middle school. I didnt know her at that time, only the past couple years and this year has she started opening up to me. She comes from a family that is overly strictly Christian. Both of her parents dont really believe in mental illnessmental help and her mother constantly gaslights her saying her depression isnt real and gets told to just suck it up or that she doesnt have anything to be depressed over. She tells me all the time about how shes tired, feeling sick constantly, body aches, has zero energy all of the time. It doesnt help that she works 40hweek. Ive been pushing seeing a psychiatrist or counselortherapist, and she wants too, but she also suffers from severe anxiety and absolutely despises the thought of hiding something like that from her parents because even just thinking about it sends her into a anxiety attack of sorts. Recently though, I feel like its gotten worse. Whats even worse is that Im the only person she talks to about this sort of thing, or I guess the only person she really talks too often in general, but recently shes started to push me awaydistance herself. I dont know if she means too, or if shes doing it purposely, but I dont know what to do. This scares me. Im trying to be there as much as I can but its starting to become difficult. This breaks my heart and I dont know what to do. Thanks for taking the time to read this. Ill answer any questions best I can.",

Things have been amazing until he moved here.. We both got a job in the same place, and I became massively stressed and depressed. The stress of everything changing hit me hard and I admit I stopped showing him any affection. I hate myself for it, we argued ALL the time. We lost our jobs due to some REAL shady stuff going on at work tax evasion, illegal activity etc and he told me he was moving back but not leaving me. ampx200B This is where I am now. Ive been back to my normal self the last few days, feeling more love for him than I ever have, wanting to show him... But I have just under 2 months to vacate our house. With little to no money in the bank and a daughter to look after. Its her birthday and wed planned a huge party ... 8 days before were due to leave. ampx200B If he leaves and Im on my own again, it WILL kill me. I cant lose this connection with him. I cant be on my own again. I cant stand the thought of not having him beside me every day, of spending the next gosh knows however many years only seeing him a few times a year, or only over Skype... ampx200B But if I move to Norway with him...

Im torn... and Im a mess. ampx200B Do I hurt my daughter in the short term... or do I just let myself die and be freed from this eternal struggle for good? Im fed up of fighting.

    "Divorce and depression Hi everyone, Please forgive any misspellings or runons. Focus isnt one of my strong suits at the moment. This is my first post here so I appreciate any advice.

    "I lost my job and potentially my career due to a deep depression. This went on for over 3 months. Eventually, i got the call i was expecting, with cracks in his voice, my boss informed me that HR had declined any further leave and that I was being let go for violation my companies attendance policy. I was heartbroken, but numb. My year internship had been for nothing now, my countless hours of studying for my FINRA exams, all my efforts were gone because i couldnt bare to face the world. It was another punch to the gut when I received my U5 in the mail, something that stays with your for the rest of your Financial industry career, stating I had been fired for not following attendance policies. Fast forward to 2 months after everything, I was able to get on my partners insurance and pay 500 out of pocked for a psychiatrist.

Im not making enough money, and I am terrified to apply for any financial services job that will see my U5 and just move on to the next candidate. Im starting to feel that if I stay at my current jobindustry, i will fall right back into that deep depression. My new job offers amazing insurance and I am able to see a therapist and psychiatrist which I am seeing regularly but I dont know if insurance benefits are a reason to stay at a company if you are absolutely miserable.

I got got confronted for that and to be honest? I think its good that this person snitched on me, because I clearly deserve some ass whoopin. So.....

Still, there is little to no research on how psilocybin interacts with Wellbutrin XL 150 mg, so what are some of the potential risks of taking psilocybin within the first two weeks of taking Wellbutrin XL 150 mg once a day and after the first two weeks of taking Wellbutrin XL 150 mg once a day? 2. I am a daily cannabis user, usually vaporizing high CBD cannabis through a Pax 3 vaporizer. I have no problem stopping my cannabis use while I experiment with Wellbutrin XL 150 mg. Still, there is little to no research on how cannabis interacts with Wellbutrin XL 150 mg, so what are some of the potential risks of taking cannabis within the first two weeks of taking Wellbutrin XL 150 mg once a day and after the first two weeks of taking Wellbutrin XL 150 mg once a day? 3. I learned that some people could experience mania or suicidal ideation while taking Wellbutrin XL 150 mg. In some cases, the individual experiences mania or suicidal ideation may not determine that they are in danger, so how can I tell if I begin experiencing such sideeffects and what can I do to keep myself safe if I start experiencing such sideeffects? 4. I was hired for a professional speaking engagement that is taking place in midNovember  slightly less than a month from now, so should I be worried about taking Wellbutrin XL 150 mg leading up to it?",
    "Goodbye. Hello, I am a 15 year old Male and plan to stab myself in the stomach and chest. I cant do anything right and nobody likes me what so ever. I am ignored and nobody even acknowledges me. All the bad in life isnt worth the good in life. My own voice and mind being my own enemy no matter what I do, pointing out everything bad in a situation. Nothing matters in the end. I have tried to take my life before but this time I promise Ill be successful and Ill no longer be a burden on everyone. Nobody is responsible for this except for me. Thanks to all but let this be my final goodbye.",
    "What is \"you\" time? Hey everyone. So Ive been depressed for a large portion of my life. Almost 20 years now..wow. Thats really hard to actually type that. But it is what it is... I am working towards getting better. I have no health insurance so doctors, meds, and therapy are not options to me right now. But I am trying to develop habits that I consider helpful. Researching as much as I can and including that advice into my own treatment. ampx200B Of course, when I can afford it, I do plan on getting therapy and the works. But this is the best I can do at the moment. ampx200B One thing I see a lot is to make time for you. Make time for yourself. I have been struggling for months to figure out what this really means. Is it being productive? Or is it just being relaxed and leisurely? Is it a moment of quiet? Is it doing some sort of hobby? I wanted to see if anyone had ideas of what it would mean. ampx200B I have a feeling that it can mean any of those things, but what is the ultimate goal? How should you feel after making you time?",
    "Will the fatigue from Citalopram go away? I have been on Citalopram for five weeks. The first three weeks I was on 10mg, the last two weeks Ive been on 20mg. On 10mg, I felt tired in the morning, but it got better throughout the day. This lasted for the first week, then I stopped experiencing fatigue. Since switching to 20mg, Ive been feeling even worse fatigue that barely gets better throughout the day. When can I expect this fatigue to start improving? Has anyone had luck switching to taking Citalopram in the evening? Im currently taking it in the morning... Spring break is coming up in a week. Would it be worth it to wait it out and see if the fatigue goes away, or should I use that time to start a different AD? Ive heard that Citalopram can be a sedating AD. Does that mean the fatigue will probably never go away?",
    "How do you love yourself when you don't see any value there? Hey all. Im turning to you because... Im not sure where else to go. Im living in Melbourne, Australia at the moment. Getting help is tougher than I ever imagined. Mental health organisations are overworked and understaffed. Therapy sessions are far from affordable. And I am holding on to my last string. To be honest, I have been for some time. My whole life, Ive felt undesirable and worthless. I dont see much value in myself or what I do, and I never have. I constantly feel like a waste of space. It has me thinking is life really worth living this way? I met someone who made me feel otherwise... at least for a while. But the honeymoon phase is long over and as he retreats back into his shell of commitmentless comfort, I melt into a puddle of misery. Perhaps its because I know the one thing Im unequivocally good at is loving someone else. So maybe I should learn to love myself instead. But how do I do that when I cant see any value in myself? Its an impossible task.",
    "Skipped school to kill myself, didn't go through with it, what now? Please help me, anyone. I literally did nothing for the next 30 minutes to an hour, literally felt nothing, just thinking about what I was going to do. Then after that I just went to my bed, and started researching for maybe 34 hours, methods, what to expect, etc. etc., all these things that I had been too scared to look up before. Found out the way I wanted to go, was literally about to go find the things I needed, but was so scared that I wanted to delay it somehow, even though I was still determined to go through with it. I told myself that I would set a timer for 30 minutes to sleep, and after that if I still wanted to kill myself, Id do it after that. Well when I woke up, I felt a little different, a little more hopeful, Im honestly not sure why, just hopeful enough to not kill myself today at least. Now I have to figure out what to do next. I had a math test today, an ap macro final, a small spanish presentation, and an anatomy quiz. It just seems so so so overwhelming, like I cant deal with it and I dont even know where to start, or what to say to the teachers, or if I can still take them, or what I tell my dad when the school calls today to tell him I wasnt there, or what to do about trying to manage this so I dont end up going through with my plan tomorrow, or the day after that, or next week.

    "Need help/advide Hi so I need some guidance as I feel very lost at the minute. Ive suffered from anxiety and depression for years now, but when I graduated university last summer things just spiralled out of control to the point where I was put on anti depressants again and my doctor told me I wasnt fit for work. The anti depressants have helped with my depression but my anxiety is still that bad that doing anything but sitting in my room is a massive struggle. A couple of weeks ago my doctor said I should start to be eased in to a job again, but I had a work capability assessment a few days ago and got told that I should take a year of sick pay and focus on getting better, as if I got a job I would likely crash within a few weeks, and this has happened before. Im running out of things to say when friends and family ask if Ive got a job, so this is a nightmare situation especially as the only person whos not a professional who knows is my mum. And its all well and good trying to focus on getting better but Ive been trying for many years now and havent made much progress, recently Ive been trying mindfullness and working out but neither has helped much I also start counselling again next week but this has never helped much either. I want to work, be happy, not be anxious all the time and not feel so alienated from everyone else my age and society in general. What should I do? Has anyone else been in a similar situation and recovered? Can anyone point me in the right direction of something that would help?",

    "Could you read me? So, since I was a child I was really close and sometimes, hyper protected to my momand the only other child company that I had was my brother, who is 3 years older than me. My brother is gay, and since always have been very feminine, and we used to play imitating pop singers and famous women. So I start to grew really feminine, but pay attention, IM NOT SAYING THAT THE FACT THAT I WAS FEMININE IS BAD. But when I went to school, the thing was not pretty. I spent the years of 4  11 being extremely rejected by my male colleagues and being accused of wanting to be a woman and being gay. Sometimes I was interested in playing soccer like the other boys, but I knew that I would be bullied Everytime I was feminine which was all the time. And these masculine activities would always have been a strange thing for me. My father was really interested in soccer, but never talk to me about it and my mother always rejected soccer just like every other thing my father liked. My brother... Not interested. But I would still play with him of imitate female singers and sometimes, put a fake dress into us. It was pretty much this dynamic until 2010, when I was 9. My brother and I were still playing this, until, in some moment, he started to touch my penis and put my hands on his penis. Im not gonna lie, I knew something wrong was happening, but I didnt actually think about it as sex. I didnt even knew what sex was, until the moment that he lay in the couch and put his penis, expecting me to blow it. Obviously, only now I realised that he wanted me to do oral sex on him, but at the time I didnt really know what he was wanting me to do. So I just stand there, paralized and nervously laughing. Later, he went to my front and put his butt in my penis and start dancing with it. I just felt so uncomfortable but couldnt get out, for some reason. I just remember crying hard at that night, just very disturbed. I just remember this fact very recently, with therapy. Since then it was just blocked from my mind.",
    "Life’s going downhill and everything that happens is mainly my fault I beg to them not to as it obviously makes her uncomfortable but they wont stop, my sin wont leave me, no matter what I do. Its still on my back, and this one kid wont leave me alone about it, and he antagonizes me about it. The sad truth is that I cant blame anyone. It was my fault, I shouldnt of said that. Ironically the week after this happened our school got a presentation on cyber safety. My last issue, and arguably the one that makes me sad and angry, are my friends. I dont think its their fault. I believe its just mine for acting stupid and making so many horrible choices, so I cant blame them. But they never have anything good to say about me. Ever since kindergarten, I was constantly being reminded of how stupid and idiotic I was. Now they wont leave me alone for how much of a disappointment I am, how Im stupid, and they constantly make fun of me and wont leave me alone for my mistakes, as well as making up lies. Hell, one friend is calling me a pedophilia because I like Asian girls and theyre shorter than me or some shit, even though the ones I sorta like are in my age group. If theres an argument on the bus, Im the main problem because I spook to loudly and disturbed everyone. If I had an argument with someone and we have a fight, they always bring up a point that makes me realize Im the wrong one. No matter how much I compliment them, they never have anything good to say back aside from my idiotic ignorance. Overall, I want to commit suicide more than anything. The thing is, I just cant being myself to because 1. Its forbidden in the Bible 2. What would my parents think? I cant just leave them. But still, regardless of all of that, I still want to end my life and go with the Lord. However, the moment I see the Lord, Im going to see the gate of hell for all my sins and what I have done. Im vulgar, perverted, violent, etc.",

She cleared out her childhood bedroom and we thought it would be fun to read trough old diaries since Im not doing great at the moment. But we eventually read mine too. I forgot how dark my notes were. It was honestly very eye opening but I think reading about my suicidal thoughts, in the current situation concerned her a lot. This morning, she handed me the letter, saying Id have to read it when Im feeling down. She wrote about our friendship, how we give each other the courage to be ourselves, how much Ive helped her, how much she wants to be there for me. I read the letter twice, I cried both times.

Ive had a lot of negative thoughts in my head for a very long time. Usually involving self hatred and a strong feeling that Im unworthy of care, love and affection.

Im only 20 but these past couple years I havent felt like I lived my life properly. Ive been floating through everything and I no longer have a life worth living. Its been years of not being able to get much pleasure out of things. Ive now reached peak depression because I no longer have any hobbies or interests, goals and passions, I dont feel the need to socialize and make friends anymore, I dont do anything with my life and I gave up trying because my mind and body did years ago.

Im not good enough I feel, and that anything I do isnt good enough so why try. The pandemic has made things much worse and Ive already had a suicide attempt back in November, and Im still suicidal since my last attempt, and I have a strong feeling that I wont live long because my depression has made it so that the pain is overtaking the will the live any longer. These past 4 years, Ive only had a few days where I felt okayish, but 99.9 of these days out of 4 years have been depression, so I feel that its not worth living anymore. I dont know how to get out of this mess. Nothing is enjoyable anymore. Ive tried multiple antidepressants and therapy hasnt been working so far. Im isolated and suicidal. Im afraid Ill always be this way so I want to stop living. My negative thoughts keep me even more depressed because the future just seems to be more depressing and lonely. So why live it. What is going to make me not depressed if I have been consistently clinically depressed for over 3 years? 3 mother fucking years and this shit hasnt went away. Im losing value in life, it feels like a shitty game thats no longer enjoyable and Ill gladly stop playing it. Life feels like a joke to me now, I just cant live anymore.",

Like emptying cat litter, putting more food in the fur babies dishes, making sure they have water, grab something to eat like Dry Cereal or a PopTart or something like that you dont have to do anything to and setting my alarm for work the next day and making sure I have underwear and everything for work the next day.

I totally get the reasons why people are the way that they are but if you know you are not parent material why the fuck would you have children, it doesnt make any fucking sense. I was doing alright for a while now, but shit happened and the suicidal feelings are coming back again. And the funniest part is that they actually expect me to stay alive for them? What the actual fuck is this? Suicide is not selfish, because the act of bringing me into this world is selfish. Who the fuck asked for life? Not me, nor do i want it. And expecting me to live and like my life when biologically im fucked is the most selfish thing ive ever heard.ugh am i just being an immature brat or it is justifiable for me to feel this way?",

Im not nearly close enough to any of my friends to talk to them about how i feel.

    "Please help me She the new GP knows that I am diagnosed with two chronic painful diseases but she refused to give me any painkillers because just a paracetamol should be enough. I still need to wait a whole month to be able to visit my gyn, the only person that seems to care about my pain. So I am at home with no painkillers, in daily pain and so weak that folding the laundry makes me pant from the effort. I kept going to the same therapist but she is clearly not prepared to deal with chronic pain. I told her three times that i have daily suicidal thoughts and she just changes topic, she wont adress it. Also she gives me stupid advice that is incompatible with my diseases. In our last session she told me that I should consider working as a gardener again. How? Doing basic housechores is a nightmare for me, how I am suposed to do an incredibly physical job???? I am not going back... Then its the issue with my money. As I didnt had a job except the few months gardening in three years I barely have any money left I spent my savings doing a Master before coming ti Belgium. I cant sustain myself and I am compeltely dependent on my partner. I tried aplying for disability but as a migrant not only I dont have any right to get help but the social worker told me that if I dont find a job in two years when my status is reviewed I will likely be kicked out of Belgium. I will become a homeless person. To apply for any help in Spain I just need to work 12 months.... And then there is the issue with my partner. He loves me and tries to suport me. But he really doesnt want to hear about my pain or depression, I cant talk to him about anything that worries me. He simply doesnt care. He also refuses to do any house chores. He forces his SICK girlfriend to do all housechores walking the dog, cleaning, cooking, laundry, gardening, garbage.... He doesnt care that I am in pain or sick, he will simply not help me.",
    "I think I need help.(Long)(references self harm) Im not one to usually ask for help, im a high schooler now and for most of my life Ive been a suffer in silence person. However, a couple years ago, towards the end of 7th grade, I sort of began to withdraw myself from friends and family, and I basically started writing a journal in which I very heavily contemplated self harmsuicide. My parents found this and set me up with a counselor, who thinks I have majorclinical depression. She recommended I go to the doctor for very mild antidepressants, because she thought those could help. My doctor, though, didnt prescribe them. It feels like no one takes it seriously when I do talk about this? I did begin smoking weed in about 8th grade to help cope, but have began smoking a lot less once I did meet counseling. I should note that it did feel better over the summer between 7th and 8th grade, but hit full swing in 8th. Im in 9th now still feelin it, but my friends just sort of brush it off when I mention the possibility of self harmsadness. Im not really sure what to do with myself to be honest because no one seems to care, school counselors just told me to join clubs and no one really tries to help. People say I hope it gets better, dude! But it always seems fake. Could I get some advice please? ?",

    "Help -self harmed for the first time Throwaway account. Background Im 16 and have struggled with moderate to severe depression for about a year now. It came out of the blue, although Ive had anxiety for a while. Depression runs strongly in my family so not altogether surprised. Ive struggled so much with lethargy, apathy, hopelessness, imposter syndrome and feeling like people think Im better than I am, and generally feeling like a useless human. I still love myself and always will, but Ive started to really doubt my capabilities and Im not sure how much of what my brain tells me are actually lies. ampx200B Anyway, last night I had a breakdown and was really struggling to communicate how I was feeling to my parents. I know they love me, but I dont think they entirely understand whats going on for me. My mom was trying to get me to exercise to combat the depression but my body felt like a bag of rocks and I just didnt have any willpower left so I just refused. So my mom got super angry and eventually I just collapsed in the bathroom. I dont know what made me do it, but I ran to my room with these really sharp tweezers and cut up my legs and made them bleed. I counted and it seems there are about 40 scratches that bled, plus a zillion more before it got more intense ampx200B Thats the first time Ive ever hurt myself on purpose, and now Im scared that I might do it again. Because the pain felt good, it burned and the adrenaline rush felt like a drug and I didnt feel so passive anymore. But now that I have my thinkingfeeling brain back I feel guilty and Im afraid that having done it once means I could easily do it again. Because I dont feel like it was really me that did it, it was like my depression monster climbed out and possessed me, and that could happen again. What should I do? Has anyone else experienced this and have advice? Im honestly kind of scared, now that I know what Im capable of. I never thought Id be the kind of person to self harm",

I recently went through some therapy through my college. My assigned therapist was a practicum student and last week was our last session together after this entire semester. I feel very empty now. My mom lost her brother to suicide and my best friend lost another one of her good friends the same way. Seeing first hand the way it affected them keeps me going but that feeling is diminishing. Im just so tired of everything and I have no motivation or energy to do the simplest of tasks. When I think of my future it seems like such a long road ahead of me and I dont want to do it.

    "Burned out and trying to come back from it First time posting here. Looking for incite on things. Backstory Im in a weird place in my life right now. I just turned 30, and there have been events in my life that I want to get over. I could itemize the events but its more about my feelings about them that I want to move on from. I was a social work student but I dropped out because it was emotionally draining. And across a lot of different areas of my life I need to cope with things. I feel defeated and ashamed of myself. I feel like I dream too big and cant attain those dreams. I feel pain from society and how people treat me and each other. Im sick and tired of the hate we all do to each other. We are all in pain for different reasons in life. I feel like its pain for seeing how the world is and wishing that these conversations would start to get visibly better. I scroll Reddit because of how amazingfunnybeautiful things can be. I think Im too weighed down from seeing so much pain. I got divorced a year ago and all of my friends and I lost touch. My ex was a good person most of the time but he did some pretty abusive stuff too. And so Im dealing with grief of people no longer being in my life that I liked having around but that I had to say goodbye to in a way so that my life could try to get better. I want the grief to heal. I want my self worth to heal back. Im tired emotionally and I know Ill get back on my feet. Theres so many reasons to feel sad about anything or everything. But what do you do next once you know that? Knowing theres endless reasons for things to be bad or to be good. I feel drained like its some sort of mental gravity not sure how to describe it but almost like Ive been working myself too hard. Things will get better but I need to figure out how to heal myself inside.",

    "How do I support my girlfriend who is struggling with depression? Hi, first time poster here, I hope this is an appropriate post for this board. My girlfriend is struggling with depression, probably stemming from childhood trauma unstable family situation, regular police presence in the house. She is taking large doses of venlafaxine 225mg for 120lb body weight to cope with her illness, but it can only do so much. She often has problems controlling her anger, which is related to the point of this post, because when she is in a depressed mood, anger is often the only way she can really communicate. She recently had a complete nervous breakdown in the car I was driving, over an argument we had. It ended with her calling an ambulance on herself to be taken to emergency psychiatric care. She is now considering some time in a psychiatric institution for herself. Now here comes my main questions She often has these breakdowns, where she often can only shout and scream, or completely retreat. She describes it as such She can either scream, or say nothing and retreat to sleep for a day. I have found that I am very unhelpful for her in these moments. I am a very careful person, and I think a lot before doing anything. She says she needs guidance and structure in these moments. How can I support her in those moments? I have tried to give her clear instructions in those moments in the past, but it has not worked well. I think my personality type just does not make it very credible if I say Calm down, were doing X now, because I dont behave like that in a noncrisis situation. I think her anger is often a frustration about her inability to deal with her illness. Unfortunately, her behavior in those moments also scares me. So I am even more timid to help her. Not that I am scared that she will hurt me or anything, but I am scared of making it worse. Also, I quickly become frustrated if i try something and it does not work, which is an issue I need to work on. ampx200B TLDR How do I support my depressed girlfriend during a mental breakdown? Anyone out there who can relate to her behavior and knows what works for them? Any advice welcome!",
    "\"I hate myself\" ... Change from CBT to psychoanalytic? Hi, maybe someone got some insight into this. I have been in cognitive behavioral therapy for years. While it helped me coping with rumination and anxiety, I still dont like myself very much. I am often under the impression I should be someone else, someone better... be more manly, be more independent, be more active... well, it goes on for a while  Now, recently a friend got me to think about my childhood, and one thing stood out. In 3rd or 4th grade I wrote the sentence I hate myself over and over again in some of my school notebooks. None of the teachers seemed to notice it  at least I dont remember ever being asked about it. Also I seem to have a lot less memories about my childhood than other people. My mum told me three years ago, after I just came out of a twomonth stationary therapy and mentioned to her that I have some gaps in my memory, that I had a happy childhood. I have no reason to doubt her honesty, but I know she is able to see things the way she wants them to. Also, I want to cry all the time, but I cant. It often is on the edge, but mostly it stays there, or just a few seconds of real crying and then I get too selfconscious, I guess, and it stops. Its killing me... like something wanting to get out... Im 31 and just want to cry a whole day like a baby, but I cant. Is it maybe time to go an oldschool psychoanalytic approach? I just have vague notions of couches and old bearded men and hypnosis My therapist is great, but there is no real breakthrough. It always feels like there must be more. I even consider trying psychedelics now to help me get to the root. Well, that was a lot. Any help, insight, comment is appreciated. No native speaker, so please ask if anything is unclear.",

Yesterday while i was helping my father he yelled at me in the most agreesive type, and got me informed that i need to be obedient, because i am not a 50 y like him. While i was driving, and he was constantly telling me i am a loser. And he always tells me that because i have no job, cause the pandemic, i have to do whatever they want because i cannot afford to pay. He told me that this is how he loves me while being aggressive. I was so terrified and scared because we could cause an accident. While he does not have a driving license, he sais driving is simple and is for stupid ppl. And he treats me like i am a cab driver, telling me where to go... I asked him while driving and trying to focus on the road, why does he treat me like this. Always when i ask questions, no one answers. He constantly commands and yells at everyone in the house, and he always tries to proof that he knows shit.... I was terrified because he could smack me while i was driving. I went in a shock, while i was home, i cried so much, my self esteem is down. And something in me died yesterday. I am a good person and stayed out of trouble, worked. But even when i paid things in the house, or if i helped them constanlty, didnt matter je would treat me the same. Nothing satisfies him. All my life yelled and threatened me in various scenarios like school things, even if he didnt stayed with me and never involving in my after school homework, to pressuring me about exams and threaten me of i dont pass, i will end up being garbage man.

    "Life’s going downhill and everything that happens is mainly my fault For starters Im 13 years old. Im in the 7th grade and this issue has been going on for what Id say about a year now. I dont know if whats going on even is depression, maybe Im just being edgy. To be frank, I have no idea anymore. The more I stress about it the more I try talking about it with my friends, and sometimes they ignore it, other times they tell me to stop being emo. Also, FYI, this will be really long. The fact of the matter is that things havent been going well. We can start at my grades. You see, my brother age 25 is a collage dropout and my sister age 21 is still doing great and Im happy for her. The thing is that because my brother had dropped out of collage he has a job now and is starting to get back on track and is still living with my parents and struggling, I feel this pressure that I need to do well and be the best I can to not end up like him. Im sure thats normal, but the one problem is my mother. I always try to satisfy her, seeing the smile and satisfaction on her face is my dream, but she never seems to be satisfied. If I brought home Bs that wasnt good enough. If I got an answer wrong on my test even though I still got a good grade it wasnt good enough because I got something wrong. When I brought home my interim, I got 3 Bs and 4 As and when she saw, all she did was ask if I needed help because my grades were dropping. It hurt me. She wants me to become an orthodontist. When I brought home this report thingie on my level 15 on english and writing, I got a level 5. Only 7 of students in my state got that. However there was also one for science and math, I got a level 4 on that, which is what most people in my state got. When she saw, she told me to do better because I math and science are more important for becoming a orthodontist. I feel helpless. My next issue is this incident that happened with my crush.",

    "I'm a recovering alcoholic with Severe Depression I started drinking about 8 years ago, and Ive been sober for 2 years. Within those 6 years, I went from casually drinking, to drinking a fifth of Vodka a day. It got so bad that if I went without alcohol for a day I would start to have withdrawals. I pawned a lot of my stuff just for alcohol. I destroyed my relationship with my son and his mom. I did a lot of things in that time that I wouldnt ever do today. I look back on it and wonder why I even acted the way I did. I was a complete asshole. Fast forward to today, and Im still dealing with a lot of issues. I cant function like a normal human being.

A couple years later I met my first long relationship girlfriend and as you can imagine I fell hard for her and spoiled her like crazy, she helped my reconnect with my father and I told her about my trauma and to my surprise she also was a victim, we both tried to get professional help within our means but only I got serious about it and kept going to my sessions, she said she was fine on her own and knowing how hard this was I let her take her own choice and just tried to be supportive when needed, needless to say it ended bad, near the end when we were about to move in together I tried to start a conversation about how we began getting together and how special she was to me, apparently I was the only one that felt that way because she told me that the only reason she kissed me and begun hanging out with me was because she felt pity for me, we had other issues like a poor sexual life and not enough time on her part for us, so after she told me about how we really had begun our relationship I felt numbed and after a few days in emotional hell I broke up with her, I listed all that was wrong with the relationship and told her that something that begins with pity cant have a future, I wasnt able to tell her that that was what hurt me the must, she never apologized and we went our separate ways, her family loved me and knew I was the good guy and I was the best for her and tried to help but never went passed of a small conversation with me, they were harder on her but in the end they are her family, I found out she also cheated later on and it was what killed the last pieces of love I had for her, I didnt confront her about it and we never spoke ever again, the pity confession destroyed my self confidence we were together for close to 4 years.",
    "I need your support, hopefully its ok i ask. Hey guys , i hope you are having a great day. I know its weird to ask , but if someone here knows science or has a background in science particually biology and biochemistry , and can help me understand something, that would be lovely and really help me I have depression, ocd and anxiety , and my anxiety can be triggered by science stuff .

    "Any hard won good mood disappears at the minorest inconvenience I have moderate to severe depression. Sometimes Im able to get excited about things though and thats great. But even when Im in a good mood, every time something mildly inconvenient happens I get really upset and have a hard time pulling myself out of it. Like I went to the zoo one of my favorite places today and found out theres a small surcharge to reprint my lost membership card and it just crushed me and now Im not excited to be here any more. Or a few weeks ago I went to a store and they didnt have one thing I wanted because of supply chain issues and I was grumpy for like an hour. It sounds stupid and immature but I dont know how to stop it. Its seriously impacting my quality of life.",
    "21 male, in post-relationship, feeling awful. Hello friends, Ive been thinking recently I need to talk about whats going on. I feel like my family members have heard enough of it and they dont really give me the answers or ease that I need. I loved a girl, and she loved me. She had always been dealing with mental health issues. She acted in ways she expected Id want to facilitate the relationship. In more blunt words, she had sex with me because she knew I wanted it even though it wasnt enjoyable for her. When the issue became clear, and the distance between us bolstered, I became restless. It seemed to me she had stopped loving me. I begged her to get help for the issues, but they were so deeply connected to her life that she was hurt that I would suggest the she could overcome them. We eventually broke up. I dont think either of us stopped loving the other. She hates me now, thinks Im some kind of asshole liferuiner. All I ever wanted was for her to be happy. It was trauma and sadness preventing her from being happy, and no matter how hard I tried, I could not help her. That was months ago now. I started to distance myself from it all. But I still have dreams of holding her and telling her I miss her. Yesterday, it came back with a vengeance. I cried and pained, looked at her social media, seeing directed passiveaggressive posts. It was really painful. I shouldnt have done it. So I need support. Should I just be pushing through this and moving on? Some part of me wants to fix it and love her again, but I know that wouldnt be good probably. And I know that if I was back with her, I wouldnt feel the love that I am searching for. It just hurts. I dont know how to feel. I just wish I could forget. Any support and advice would be amazing. Just to know that somebody out there recognizes Im not the bad guy, I wanted her to be happy. But my own needs became my care, and I stopped supporting a person I love because of sex.",
    "Years of worsening chronic fatigue/fog continue to cripple my life As a result, I feel intoxicated more easilyquickly. Sometimes 1 beer and Im already feeling really drunk. Im slow now both mentally and physically. Head almost always feels very tired and heavy, but I dont get headaches that often. I yawn way too much. Anhedonia and apathy as Ive gotten tireder and tireder. I have gradually become indifferent to most things. I literally come across like an emotionless zombie now because I am so damn exhausted 247. Almost nothing phases or interests me anymore. I feel like I get every coldflu virus that comes around. And it takes me much longer to get over them. I am emotionally flat lined. One of my eyelids droops a little bit, mostly later in the day andor when Im more tired. I feel like I need lots of sleep to recover, but all sleep really does is reset me a little bit and is very unrefreshing. All of these symptoms seem to be worse when Im sick, stressed, get less sleep, etc. Overall, it feels like I was hit by a truck. From the moment I wake up to the moment I pass out from sheer exhaustion at night. Everything feels like its suppressed by this fog that has gradually gotten worse over time. For example, caffeines effect, sex drive, postworkout adrenaline and endorphins, getting plenty of sleep, etc. I can sort of FEEL all these things for the most part, but it feels hidden and pushed down from this utter exhaustion. Its like nothing can surpass the fatigue and fog. Its gotten to the point where I feel like Im living my life from the backseat and am just going through the day mindlessly on autopilot. It literally gives me anxiety and depression to feel like this and not know why, and watch my life just pass me by at the same time. And the thing that sucks is that I WANT to do things and live life, and am still pretty optimistic, but Im just too out of it, its embarrassing. I come across like a drugged zombie when I try.",
    "A bit of a strange case: Exercise has DESTROYED my mental health. Thoughts? Advice? First, some basic health data about myself Age16 SexMale Height 510 WeightAround 142145 pounds Ever since the summer of 2019, exercise has been a huge part of my life. My main fitness goal was gaining muscle, so I was doing strength training with weights around three to four times a week. But I also wanted to be able to eat a lot of food and generally have a relaxed diet at the same time. A big reason for that was because my sister had recently recovered from severe anorexia, so my father thought that it would be wise for me to not trigger her and potentially provoke a relapse by following a restrictive dietby restrictive I mean eliminating junk food, soft drinks, etc. Because of this, I started doing a lot of cardio, and I really mean a lot. I started out with around 30 minutes of running every other day, but I gradually added more cardio over time. My peak was during the summer of 2020, when I was doing around 2 and a half hours of cardio every other day, in addition to 10 minutes of HIIT on my strength training days. When school started, I cut the duration down to the following routine alternating between 1 hour of strength training plus 35 minutes of cardio and 95 minutes of cardio every other day. Then, in January 2021, I got a severe knee injury from doing calf raises. Little did I know the day that I injured myself that, from that point on I would descend into the darkest, most hellish part of my 16 years on this Earth. You have to understand that Id made exercise an essential part of my life. If I didnt complete my exercise, I would fall into a pretty bad mood, sometimes for the rest of the day. So when I injured my knee, I was extremely disappointed. Every form of cardio which Id been doing and enjoyedbiking and running was off the table. Judging from prior experience, swimming was also not an option, because I found itand still do super boring and torturous. My last cardio option was the rowing machine. I replaced my bikingrunning with rowing. The problem was that I HATED rowing, even. more than I hated swimming.",

I swore growing up working with my dad that Id never end up here. Somehow, some way Id find some way to make a living and support myself in some way that involved more mental work and air conditioning. I always thought Id be a writer, but since about 25 when I had a mental health crisis Ive had no inspiration barely the aspiration to remain alive for a long time, I just existed very depressed, in no small part because I was doing this same work. I have a college degree, but its a bachelors in Culinary Arts. Essentially its useless as anything but wall art, but it was important to me to finish college regardless of how depressed I was. The program gave me an easy couple semesters when I couldnt stand being. I always thought some inspiration would hit, or some brick would fall onto my head and Id see clearly what I should do with my life. I remember tearful prayers at 14, asking God for some kind of guidance that never came. I didnt know then and I dont know now what Im going to do when I grow up  35, in case you forgot.

Sometimes I think, if I have no fear of death then why dont I just do something crazy with my life and just go for my dreams and just push myself to exercise more. But I dont even know what my dreams are now. I dont know what I like anymore and its hard to enjoy things. I just watch shows or try to take walks and keep avoiding my responsibilities.

And i burst crying pretty dramatically.. i felt devastated. I mean i know its a ridiculous way to react but i went from good day to worst day ever for a stupud reason in no time and i couldnt stop laughing for a while. I guess i felt frustrated or idk but i kept muttering stuff and couldnt stop crying. And when i calmed down about half an hour later i was worried i had reacted this way before when i wasnt feeling well but i didnt think id react that way now. I thought everything was fine. Now i just dont know if i really am. The only reason i can think of as the source is that Ill be taking classes again after almost a year now Ive failed my last high school year twice in the past when my depression was really bad and after that and therapy i felt good enough to study again i stopped highschool i chose a different institute i studied for two years and my grades were good for the two years ive been studyingi passed the final exam but half way through the end year project i just gave up. I dont know if i can blame my mental health for it or if i just turned into a self sabotaging person or just that it wasnt what i really wanted to do bur i was driven by the fact that i dont have a choice so i just did it. After that i stayed out of school for about a year doing half time jobs and now i want to try something different again. Im afraid thats the cause but i dont want it to be i just wanna finish what i start this time. This thing is already going on for too long. Im not sure what Im asking you here.

    "What happens when you get well? How often do you pop by the doc? Hi guys, I first went to a psychiatrist last summer. I had been selfmedicating something with tons of caffeine for years and wanted and needed to get to the bottom of why I needed large volumes of coffee in order to function the tipping point was having gallbladder surgery and caffeine being less of an option. Without it, there was an underlying tiredness and pessimism that wasnt shifting by itself, despite my best efforts at self care and healthy living. The past fourteen months has been the drug merrygoround Im guessing many here are familiar with. First tried every ADHD stimulant which all improved functionality like caffeine! but all literally every single one also made me more depressed. Then an SSRI which made me tired but more optimistic. Finally, weve moved onto Wellbutrin. Im wont to say wow, Im better! but I have a strong and positive feeling that this is going to be the chemical that shifts my dysthymia. Perhaps it will fizzle out. Perhaps Ill need something else. But .. after four weeks Im feeling optimistic and well in a way that I havent on anything Ive tried so far ie, Im more than just wired, Im confident and hopeful. My question now turns to okay, so whats next? Assuming that this is the drug for me, how often do you typically go to your prescriber just to make sure that things are working out okay? Is there such a thing as a yearly mental health checkup to verify that youre staying on course? Basically, once you finally manage to shift depression or at least get it to a manageable point ... what does the maintenance process look like?",

    "How to deal with the cyclical triad of draining symptoms Over the past months my depression has progressively become more disruptive.

Outside of increasing my SSRI dose with my doc, how can I overcome this if I cant find therapy right now due to pandemic? Much of my depression I feel comes from loneliness. Im a man in my late 20s and Ive never had a true best friend or romantic partner. I hoped this year would be that year because I found a job in a city I wanted to live, and it felt like a chance at renewed life. I accepted before the shutdown, and started after restrictions were in place, so Ive spent the entire year alone in a new city as all social avenues were cut off. I almost have no socialization with coworkers either due to working remotely. I tried online dating, but that made things worse as I didnt match with anyone and sent me on a selfdoubting downward spiral.

He had nobody else and it is my pleasure to help him and be there for him forever. I just have legitimate concerns that I believe your tips and advice could help me navigate the situation better. Any tips ? ? Thank you so much, Christina.

    "Are my feelings valid if I don't cut, or harm myself? I feel like this is a hard topic for me to approach, but I would like to express some things Ive been feeling. Before we start, I would like you to know this is going to be very long, and explaining things that happened in my life, and what I am feeling at this moment. Thank you, all. Truly, Im not sure if I am depressed, but at this moment Im not willing to seek out help, outside of virtually. I hope you all understand that. But I am sad, that much for sure. I cannot express really in words what I feel, other than the fact than waking up is seeming to be a struggle at this point, always feeling overcome with such a gloomy feeling, where if anyone pushed me Id be constantly on the brink of tears. The entirety of being constantly upset, trying to cry, trying to find a way to let out the emotions which you didnt even know you were feeling, but being so empty, you cant even muster tears. I believe I started feeling these feelings around a year ago, after getting out of an abusive relationship. I became so dependent on one person, that I thought I couldnt cope without them. I made excuses for everything they did in my head, and always ran back to them. When they blamed me for their suicide attempts, because I didnt show them enough affection whilst they were hospitalised, though I do not know if she was truly hospitalised, or if it was another facade, I broke. I sent over 100 messages a day, as I knew this would happen if I would not, but she didnt want me to feel happy, despite anything. Not even in the simplest of things to brighten my spirits per say. Anyhow, I had to discard my friends, she had complete control over whom I talked to, and whom I wanted to be friends with. And she forced me to choose between her and them once again. I picked her. It may be irrational to some people why I would do it, but when someone starts convincing you how much you need and rely on them, with all the things youd planned together, with what you said, the words they, and you, said. Its so hard to turn away.",
    "jumbled mess/rant? (story + requesting advice idk) I want to see a doctor to get it clear if I have mild depression or something else. However I find it difficult to do so because I dont know how much it would cost as Im not financially stable and the culture and country I live in does not see depression well. I overthink everything. I think thats a main reason why I selfdeprecate. Because of that my selfesteem has dropped over the years that I feel I cant do anything good. I am rethinking my choice of study whether it was a good decision. I dont think I am fit to become a childcare teacher. I understand that the principal and mentor are trying to help my future but negative thoughts just keep entering my mind. I should probably go study something different in university... its hard to imagine teaching children anymore. Ive cut down on using instagram because I know it wont do me any good seeing how others live their lives. Sometimes it just triggers my overthinking whenever I see their posts. Ive been told I think too much, that I think for awhile before I reply when this person just wants to hear my honest answer. I think it kind of frustratessaddens her because she wants me to vocalise my thoughts and feelings instead of bottling up, but I still do. She says shes a call or text away but it is so difficult to contact her first because I dont want to bother her with my problems. Well I guess Ill just share these. Sorry if its really unorganised, I just needed to get some things out before I have a breakdown.",
    "Is my \"popular\" intensive trauma program abusive/unfit/re-traumatizing for me? This was the ONLY personalized meeting I have had in this program  everything else was groups or front desk people doing questionnaires. 4 I have had no meeting with anyone during or before the program regarding what I need or how this program is customized to me. 5 almost every individual in the program is on medication and there seems to be general push towards strong sedating medication. Most members could not even sit up during groups due to the level of sedation. 6 I have corrected the clinicians and staff over 4 times in a single day with the name they use for me and they continue to use incorrect names for me. I dont feel respected. 7 The staff seems to treat every action of every client as a sickness. For example, a woman felt emotional anger when someone was rude towards her in public  the staff fixated on the validity or invalidity of that anger instead of the safety needs in that situation. 8 The staff and the program itself feels very paternalizing. Example  a clinician did an activity asking everyone to name vacation spots that start with F before jumping into talking about emotional dysregulation and severe distress. The clinician an intern in training had a color wheel with activities at the level of a 4th grader for an adult group. 9 The program is apparently owned by a forprofit company and has dangerously negative reviews on google by clients and on LinkedInGlassdoor by staff. ampx200B How do I navigate my care when Im feeling unsupported by the current treatment?",

Ive been asking my mother to get me help for months at this point, and yesterday i just broke down crying and begging her to get me some help because my depression was getting super bad.

Ive been harming before and recently started again, and months ago my mother did find out about the scars and even then it wasnt enough for her to get me the right help. Now I know that the virus slowed down everything for everyone, but when i was asking for a psychiatrist they were already working ppst quarantine and my mother easily booked me an appointment but she was stretching it out for absolutely no reason.

    "I’ve broken a year long streak of not cutting and now I can’t stop (long post I’m sorry) Its just about two months until my eighteenth birthday. Ive been having these terrible thoughts for almost as long as I could remember. It just started out as this awful feeling and its evolved into daily thoughts of suicide, nonexistent self confidence, what can only be described as extreme social anxiety, a constant feeling of loneliness, and self hatred. About two years ago I started cutting. I dont know why i started but i did it for almost a year. It took the pain away emotionally and made it all physical. It became something I could see and touch not just this oppressive darkness I feel on a constant basis. I knew it was an awful habit so I tried my best to stop. About three or four weeks ago things got really bad and I did it again. And now Im back to square one. I dont have anyone to talk to because my parents would send me to a hospital, my friends would stop talking to me, I have no significant other to share my thoughts with because I am completely unlikable and extremely awkward around other people, and my therapist refuses to do anything about anything I tell him. Every time my brain makes things bad I do it again and again and part of me wants to stop because i know its not good but at the same time I really dont want to because in some messed up way it makes things feel better. I feel trapped in my own mind and I dont really know what to do anymore. Thanks.",

    "Living with my parents is sucking the life out of me. Hi. F21 here. Ive been suffering from depression for god knows how long. I live in a 3rd world country, so therapy here aint an option if youre not insanely rich, which Im not. My parents split up in very bad terms, but still live together since none of them have any other place to go than this, so you can imagine how it is. Both of them bitch about each other secretly behind each others back a.k.a. with me. Since my older brother leaves for work early and comes home late, my parents have literally no one else to talk to but me. I understand that totally and try to listen to them as best as I can. But they bitch about how the other one suck, what they do bad, how inconsiderate and ridiculous they are, etc. My dad does this more often. Also, I feel like my dad has become incredibly lazy. Hes 60, retired but is in perfect physical shape, in general. I know there are things that he shouldnt do anymore, but he literally wont eat anything during the day if no one else is there to cook. ANYTHING. He wont tidy up, he wont even move from his char if he doesnt have to. Im a college student. I got a ton of papers and things to study lately, since its my second year and I dont always have the time to do things. My mom works until noon and comes back to continue to work. Shes a teacher. Its so hard to literally baby sit my dad when I know hes capable of doing simple things like fucking make lunch.

    "Are my feelings valid if I don't cut, or harm myself? Its so hard to turn away. I know now, it was a very, very abusive situation, which I kept putting myself into it. It wrecked my self esteem, and self worth. Through constant breakups, and fights which I could never win, and eventually relenting to, it puts you on tiptoes, around anything you do or say. Anyhow, after the sadness, came nothing. There wasnt happiness nor love, just nothing. I still cared for people, and loved them, but I discarded all emotions I felt for them when speaking, or trying to talk to someone. Its almost like an offswitch was flipped, I began seeing things from a perspective which wasnt how I was. It wasnt exactly pessimistic per say, just more observant. Being able to read situations not with sympathy, or empathy, more with observation. Now, I guess, I struggle to understand how I feel myself. And this is where the issue comes in. I have known many people to cut and harm themselves. And every time I look at my situation, I cannot help but feel selfish? Im in a comfortable, content position in my life. I dont feel the need to kill, or harm myself. And I feel pitying myself is so selfabsorbed. I believe, if I were to tell anyone how I felt, it wouldnt be valid, itd be brushed off as sadness as I do not have the desire to harm myself. Its hard to truly explain what I mean, and I feel I have made this post much more differentiated from the point I was trying to make. But I truly, believe my feelings are selfish. There is so many people whom are hurting themselves, and Im here feeling sorry for myself, over a reason that is not to exist. Im upset, over feelings that arent real? Im living my every day life normally, whereas so many people cannot do the same. I do not know what to make of what Im feeling, and was hoping someone may be able to help?",
    "I suffer from persistent depression and my GF wants to leave me. I 39M suffer from persistent depression. Even as a kid Ive been depressed, bullied and have felt unloved and flawed due to a difficult upbringing and undiagnosed ADHD. I suffered from this well into my adulthood. Feeling broken and flawed. About three years ago I got diagnosed with ADHD and being in a bad situation with work and a bad breakup after a very long relationship led to depression diagnosis. I got CBT and was put on ADHD meds that helped out a bunch with my ADHD. Now on to my current situation and my reason for this post About 2,5 years ago I met this great girl and we hit it of in a long distance relationship. Shes loving, positive and very helpful. She can be short tempered though and has some insecurities. Unfortunately my work situation went from bad to worse and I just couldnt do it anymore. I got help and this led to some more help from a shrink but I was put on hold for almost two years now and I never felt so lonely, sad and depressed. Also the Covid19 pandemic did not help things either. Right now I am seeing another shrink and a psychiatrist that is helping me out with my ADHD meds. At this moment I am so tired and feel like I can not enjoy things anymore. I feel resentful and frustrated. Obviously I am in a bad place and this unfortunately damaged my relationship and my sweet girlfriend. I noticed her pulling away from me, getting frustrated with me and or irritated. At times Ive gotten the silent treatment. Sometimes I acted out in a way that hurt her in stressful situations or moments where I felt like Ive failled. Like forgetting important things, not doing something or being late again and again. She got mad or gave me the silent treatment. My anxiety got the better of me. Offcourse we talked, and that was difficult at times. I felt sad, misunderstood and she made it clear that she felt talking about it was a bad thing. Last night she told me she did not see a future for us in that way.",
    "Help Changing for the Better Ive suffered silently with depression and anxiety for most of my life, usually covering it up with relationships or alcohol. Long story short, my depression and anxiety stems largely from childhood and teenage bullying and growing up in a home with very unhappy parents who werent meant to be parents. It wasnt until recently, on the verge of divorce, that Ive moved past the stigma of depression and admitted that I suffer from it. Ive been taking high doses of CBD and ltheanine daily Ive seen the unintended, scary side effects of prescribed antidepressents too often in former friends, in addition to daily meditation, getting outdoors daily for at least 30 mins, daily exercise and changing to a healthier, mediterranean diet. All of this had helped tremendously, but I still have occasional bad days like today where its a struggle to start my day. Due to my ongoing depression and anxiety, I havent used my brain the way it is supposed to be used, and as a result, I am very slow at thinking and making decisions in the heat of the moment. This has caused nothing but pain for me in romantic relationships and with roommates. I feel so incredibly stupid. I desperately need to change, and I have been trying, but it hasnt been easy. Every time I say this week is going to be different, it isnt. I get into constant arguments with my roommate because of my slow thinking and ingrained selfishness. I am reaching out for advice from anyone who has been where Ive been and made it through. How did you finally change for the better? Im at my wits end. I really want to change, I really do. My roommate says I cant because I just dont care enough. But I do care. I just cant figure out for once and for all how to improve myself 10x more e.g., my memory, my intelligence, my selfishness, being more aware of my surroundings, and most importantly, truly living life.

    "Advice coming off meds Hi, just wanting some advice. Over the past year I developed pretty significant anxiety and depression, and after a while, my friends at uni noticed and advised that I seek professional help. I was then prescribed antidepressants sertraline, which Ive been taking for the past few months. Things overall improved over the summer, but about a week ago I decided to stop taking them, as I dont feel very comfortable being reliant on medication, and I feel like my life is at a significantly better point now. I recognise that this was probably the wrong call, and if things get worse again I will get back on them. However, since coming off them, Ive been experiencing almost constant headaches and dizziness, to the point where I am sometimes unable to walk, meaning its difficult leaving the house, or meeting up with anybody, as I feel like I cant maintain the required amount of energy. This means my lifestyle has reverted to what it was like at the worst points of the last year, being unable to go outside, and feeling unable to talk to anybody on any medium. Does anybody know how long these effects last or if theyre normal?",

Prior to starting it, his previous most recent depressive episode was back in December. After he tapered up to 100, within a week, he immediately had a major severe depressive episode and never came out of it. Rather than his normal highs, high level mediums, and mid levels, he bordered on depression the entire time. He began to withdraw completely throughout the entire month of July, and then hit a second major depressive episode that lasted about 2 weeks. Throughout this entire time, he began saying he no longer wanted to be here, doesnt have feelings for me anymore, etc. I urged him to stop taking the lamictal, and although he has reached out to his psych multiple times over the past few weeks, he has yet to hear back so he decided to stop on his own. Since stopping the meds a week ago, Ive seen flashes of the man he used to be coming back  but unfortunately, the medication numbed him to the point where he simply just doesnt want to be here anymore. Were not exactly sure what to expect from this point on  he keeps hoping that the longer hes off, that hell come back to what he was feeling emotionally but at this point we just dont know. Were still awaiting the results from other testing, but for now, were just circling the drain and its legitimately killing me.",
    "What helps you with your insomnia? I remember how relaxing and fulfilling it was to sleep when I was a kid. I couldnt get enough of it! I slept with my blankie, I sucked my thumb, I snuggled, I was never cold when the window was open, and I hated having to wake up for school in the morning. At 14 I first got depressed and started experiencing uncomfortability during sleep I was always very cold. Then, at 18, I got into a depressive episode and with the pressure to study well at uni my social anxiety increased. I couldnt go out during the day because I felt like all the people around were judging me for not working hard enough, not looking well enough, and other things. So I started sleeping through the day and living at night. Now that Ive worked through social anxiety it is not quite so bad and I enjoy getting up early in the morning because it feels like the proper and healthy way to go about my day. However, no matter how much or how little I do during the day, I cant fall asleep at night. Im just not tired. Its kinda like leaving the car running Im not doing anything, but the thoughts are racing inside my head. Ive tried the 478 breathing technique, progressive muscle relaxation, but nothing seems to work. I also try to eat early and let fresh air into the room. What helps you to calm down before going to sleep? Thanks for the answers, I love everybody",
    "I (m17) don’t feel like i have close connections to people; i’m semi-involved in multiple friend groups but i don’t feel like i can truly relate to any of them. am i just taking them for granted? i feel awful about it. i dont know. i really wish i did. any comments are appreciated. thank you for reading",
    "An I a horrible person for groping two people when I was 12? I’m now 15 The guilt and self hatred has been a burden since I came to the realisation of my toxicity when I was around late thirteen years old. I cant forgive myself, and although Im not afraid of people finding out, I hate myself so much and find it hard to live with myself. Though I definitely do not want to kill myself, Ive been having suicidal thoughts recently because Im such a toxic horrible person. I admit to myself that my actions were horrible but I still feel like my life has been completely ruined because of those actions. Am I a sex offender? I cant live with myself, I dont know what to do. I want to talk to someone like a professional but I dont know how I can. I live a complete facade all my friends think Im an awesome person but obviously they dont know that I am a vile and selfish possible sex offender. If people found out Im sure theyd hate me. I just dont know what to do. Im sorry for rambling on.",
    "I give up, I want to die. I am having suicidal fantasies and thinking of hurting myself. Anything to make this pain inside me stop. I think about ways I could go when I have downtime from work. This is a first for me. Ive always taken my familys distain for me in stride but Im tired and I cant do it anymore. Im tired of feeling rejected and unloved my family and so called friends. Several of my siblings have betrayed me and that hurts so much more. My bf is trans and they couldnt have reacted worse or said nastier things about us, upon finding out we were dating. I cant make a friend that isnt in love with me and then leaves when they realize I really just wanted a friend. Its happened so often I just dont want to make friends anymore. I dont get it bc Im so transparent about it. I feel so used and alone. My bf is great at making friends and I want to be happy for him but it hurts to see him make friends with real loyal people right off the bat. I want someone to hug me and tell me its going to be okay but there isnt anyone out there looking for a psuedo daughter. It hurts bc I know Im worth so much but what does that matter if people are going to treat me like shit? I keep thinking of how much my parents will regret treating me once Ive died. Thats the only way theyll learn or have any respect for me.",
    "Wanted to say goodbye I know, there are people who love me and need me. But itd be easier for them if they didnt, if i wasnt around. My father, im basically draining his bank account with all the help i need. My mother, our relationship does not exist. Birth parent didnt want me so i grew up in the orphanage. My friends have all moved on with their lives, we barely talk anymore. My girlfriend, all my needs and wants make her insecure.. she been my main reason for holding on. But now its not enough. I hate my body, and how hard it is to put on weight. I hate battling my demons. Im starting to hate God as well. Im a lost cause. I know it sounds stupid but i want to look good when i die. So im going to workout and become the most attractive and appealing version of myself, making amends with everyone ive hurt or disappointed, write my will, and then ill take one last stop to a church for the first time in 12 years, then im calling it quits. I love all of you, a lot of you kept me alive. Im sorry.",
    "\"Paying for happiness\" - anyone else? Some quick background I have struggled with anxiety and depression for much of my adult life I am 43. For many years it was lowlevel and manageable, with occasional flareups, but an extremely traumatic event three years ago triggered a period of major depression in my life that I am still dealing with. I am very highfunctioning  most of the people in my life probably wouldnt even know of my struggles if I wasnt very candid about them  but it can get really, really bad sometimes. I have gone to therapy for over 15 years now and for the past few years have regularly seen multiple therapists. I was on various SSRIsSNRIs over the years but they never did much of anything for me and I have been off all meds for about 14 months now. I did GeneSight pharmacogenomic testing recently and it turns out that I have significantly reduced folic acid conversion which is apparently a common characteristic of people with major depression and so I started taking folinic acid supplements a little over a month ago to try to help with this. No noticeable improvement yet. I have also been doing psychedelicassisted therapy for about a year now, which includes weekly talk therapy with a strong focus on processing childhood traumas, reintegration, IFS internal family structures therapy, and the like. As part of this therapy, I have done 5 journeys so far. This has been the therapeutic regimen that I have felt the most growth and progress from, but I am still plagued with lots of issues. I really feel like Im throwing everything but the kitchen sink at my depression plus stuff like meditation, exercise, sometimes yoga, etc. etc. but nothing every really takes. I have noticed a pattern recently where when I am able to experience true happiness which is fairly uncommon for me  not just feeling pretty okay but genuinely feeling joy, having actual fun, etc., I will inevitably experience a comedown within 13 days. And the better I feel, the harder the comedown is. It is like getting high on a euphoriaproducing drug and then having the inevitable crash. It is as if my body and mind HAVE to revert back to a depressive norm, like a rubber band snapping back the higher I stray from it, the more intense the snapback.",
    "What can I do at home if I'm trying to cut back on phone/internet usage? [Serious] I am a single mom to an 11 year old boy with severe ADHD and Dyregulatory Mood Disruptive Disorder. Weve lived alone for a year after living with my sister and brotherinlaw since my kid was 1. Ive gone from awesome to great to tired to bad to worse. My house is a disaster, my son walks all over me and is disrespectful, but he has a point I either sit at my desk or lay in bed. In fact, Ive gained a shit ton of weight this past year bc of the stress and depression. Physical activity is difficult, not to mention the lack of motivation. On to the question Ive recently gone back on my antidepressants with the determination to stick through the side effects that only last a couple weeks stomach pain, cramps, etc., and Ive come to realize that if Im not staring at my computer for work, Im staring at my phone. Dont get me wrong, my kid comes home and wants to play, I play... As long as I dont have to move too much. But, if Im off work at 1 and hes not home til 330, what do I do? If hes out playing and Im inside and its 5pm hours away from an acceptable bed time, what do I do? I feel like lately there are so many hours in the day and I just want them to pass.

Ive taken test after test trying to figure out where Im supposed to be, but nothing fits. All I want to do is sit down and rest. I spend 99 of my time doing stuff. Im on a competitive rowing team, Im a straight A student, and Im finishing up my Eagle Scout rank. All of this work, and I feel like nothing is coming out of it. I feel empty. I have no idea what I want to do with my life. I feel lost. And thats only half of my issue. I just want to be hugged, I want someone to cuddle and talk with, but nobodys there. I want to feel like I matter to someone other than my family, I want to share my life with someone. But I cant do that. Not at this age. Im just so mad about it, I feel like crying and giving up on all of it, but I know that would only make it worse. Im just tired of the waiting. I wish time would move faster. I wish I could figure it all out. I wish I had someone to love. And I know it only gets worse. I cant see myself living past 20. I cant even visualize it. Ill be lucky if I get that far.

    "Low functioning depression The more time passes, the more stressed I am, the harder it is to focus, and it all ends up being a great, vicious circle. It is the beginning of November, I need to send the university apps as soon as possible, and what am I doing? After spending my whole day laying in bed, sleeping and crying, I am writing on reddit for help as I am on a verge of a mental breakdown, once again, for two months and counting.

And yes, I am very much aware that issues like these can be easily solved by investing a bit of willpower, but I do not have any more strength to do so. I need advice. Any advice.

    "Should I commit myself to a mental hospital? TW mention of selfharm suicide My depression has gotten really bad the past few weeks. Suicidal and selfharm thoughts are happening more often, and in general I just feel very gloomy and hopeless and anxious and awful. Im going through some pretty huge life changes right now as well, so I am really overwhelmed. I can feel myself slipping into a depressive episode, which hasnt happened in over a year. I am really scared of myself and scared of what might happen if I do not get help soon. I dont think I will act on my thoughts but still, I thought the same thing a year ago and I was wrong. Not asking for pity I just dont trust myself to keep me safe, yk? A month ago I scheduled an appointment with my therapist, but her next available appointment is in another month, and I honesty dont know what will happen if I wait that long to get professional help. Im not saying Im going to kms but Im just scared for my wellbeing. I think staying at a mental hospital would really help me because I just want a break from all of the stressors in my life and I dont want to lay in my bed all day, which is unavoidable at this point. I just want a break from my life and the ability to get out of this mindset or at least prevent it from getting worse. At a hospital, there would be people to help me get better and keep me busy, so I think a mental hospital is the best option. I dont know what else to do, but I really feel like Im a bomb waiting to blow up. What do you think I should do? Im just indecisive and bad at trusting my own judgement. Thanks",

They say were a team and all here for each other, but threaten my job when I have a bad mental health day and couldnt care less or only pretend to care so they get goss I have the most amazing best friend but I do not deserve to be friends with them. Theyre the only person to make me feel almost heard and accepted, sticking through all the real bad times, but I know theyre too good for me and its only a matter of time before I push them away with my bullshit. Im constantly talking about killing myself but Im too much of a fucking pussy to do it. I only have myself in this world and that absolutely the worst possible thing I can have. For as much hate as I have for other people, I have just a tiny bit more for myself. The only person to ever love me is dead, and even then I wasnt enough for them. Can argue their lives wouldve been well worth more without my birth Im just constantly fighting with myself and the demons in my head and Im just s sick of feeling like this. I have no family, no kids, no property and barely enough money to keep me afloat. Im usually an organized person but my place has hit a new level of depression and Im sick of looking at it all but too lazy to clean up. Im anxious 247.

The planet is dying and people only care about going to parties and being stupid cunts who then mindlessly breed and treat their kids as toys.

    "The Story of This Year They are a very important part of my life and they mean the world to me. They are very honest people and they told me before moving that I shouldnt, that it wouldnt work out and that the people Im moving in with arent who I think they are and it wont work out. Me being stubborn ignored all their warnings. I have this bad habit of meeting someone and when I get along with them as well as I did with Max, I latch on and I just want to hang and spend all my time with them and it always ends up ending badly. Back to the story, I ended up moving in with these 3 people. It was bloody fantastic, I had the most amazing time with them. We would spend all night and all day talking and having fun and it really did mess with my studies and sleep. I dropped studying all together and ignored it and my insomnia got worse. On May 21st we planned on going out, we drank a whole lot and went to the club. My house mates and I decided to take MDMA which we had bought the same day. There was 2 capsules and a rock. Now Ive done drugs before, I do it recreationally, when Ive taken MDMA Ive only ever had it in capsules so I asked to have the 2 capsules just because it was familiar and I get very anxious trying new things. Well, we all took our share, went on the dance floor and thats all I remember. I woke up in hospital the next day and the doctor spoke to me about what was in my system. The capsules ended up being MDMA, ketamine and ice. My body couldnt handle the adverse reaction and basically shut down. The doctor send me home and I had the biggest come down that Ive ever had in my life. It got around that I had taken the drugs and I got into a lot of trouble, I got banned from the uni bar and I was ashamed to show my face at uni and the colleges so I actively avoided it for about a month. During this month Ive never been so miserable. I cried everyday, I never left my room, I avoided everything and everyone.",

My depression is crippling and I dont remember that last time Ive actually felt happiness. Im always stressed and anxious. I cant focus. I feel anxiety around my lifelong friends and boyfriend. I feel unloved. Ive failed in my career. Ive gained weight. I just dont love myself. Though Ive suffered for a long time with what I would say is SEVERE anxiety, I have not seeked help yet.

    "How to get myself moving again Ive been suffering from severe depression for the last 18 months. Culminated in a suicide attempt back in December. After that I managed to get myself back on my feet after a while, started therapy and was working on a course I cared about. Just under a month ago, I visited where I used to live to catch up with some friends etc. I felt ready for it. It was a mistake though and it threw me back into a severe depression. Actually my therapist believes I am suffering from PTSD and going back seems to being back a lot of negativity. After 3 weeks of suicidal thoughts, sleeping 18 hours a day and just feeling awful... Im feeling slightly better again, but still not back in a positive place. Id like to get started again on my course and to begin to build back healthy habits. But I sit in front of my laptop and Im really struggling to get myself to do anything at all. Are there any techniques I can use to begin to build up some motion?

    "I feel hopelessly inferior to everyone around me Its like there is the level of common understanding or thought that everyone else has but me. Its really hard to put into words because its just a feeling i get when i am outside, or seeing videos on the internet. Its like other people know what to say or how to act in situations im utterly lost in. And I also feel inferior because everyone else has so much experience and i havent had any. I feel like a sheltered baby compared to just my peers. They hook up, they smoketake drugs, go to bars and parties. I dont do any of that, still a fucking virgin. And when conversations inevitably get around to those topics, i feel terrible. I feel inferior, ashamed of myself, and lots guilt and self loathing. I think part of the guilt and self loathing comes from one of my initial reactions being hatred. I dont want to hate them, that doesnt make any sense because i want to be like them and theyre just living their best lives. But i do feel hatred because they not only get to casually do what i have cried myself to sleep wishing i could do. And then i turn that on myself. I shouldnt hate them, im a terrible person for thinking that. Thinking that makes you an incelneckbeardcreep. Its so grating to my ears to hear my neighbor having friends over or parties, or to hear people walking by outside on their way to a party or even just get some food. And i makes me want to slam my head. I know i can never get better if i think like this. But ill probably just never get better, period. Because i suck at socializing. I dont get invited to things.

    "The current situation has caused a HUGE setback Hey everyone. I hope you are doing better during this crazy time than I am. A bit of background Im a California girl in my 50s. And, Ive struggled for 20 years to fight off very intense anxiety and depression. I have been unable to work since 2014. Ive got a claim for SSDI, but apparently Im not sick enough. SMH I married my high school sweetheart May of 2018. He was the one that got away. I was never happier. After choosing the wrong guys all my life, I finally choose the right guy! Then in October he fell ill with an unknown lung disease. By the 21st of December I lost my love, my best friend he just couldnt breathe anymore. He put up a valiant fight. I was immediately hospitalized in the psych unit. I was overwhelmed with grief. I wanted to die. I wanted to be with him. I even tried several times to make that happen. And to add fuel too the fire, my dad passed away three months after my husband. Im not ashamed to say I was Daddys Little Girl. And I miss him just as much as my husband. So, for a whole year I struggled and fight my depression and anxiety. In that year, I was hospitalized 10 times, for psych and other ailments I have. But sometime after the 1 year mark when he died, I kinda just came out of the fog. I was feeling so much better, reaching out to his mom and other friends. I was so glad that I was gonna beat this. Fast forward to the present. I am an isolater by nature, so this covid19 situation I know I can get through it. I have one good friend and my motherinlaw for support. I keep my appointments with my psychiatrist, and take my meds as prescribed. I have no income, since I have to go through the entire process with Social Security before I can qualify to receive spousal benefits. Basically, what he was earning. Thank the good Lord for food stamps and Food Share, Ill never go hungry.",
    "Time for meds? Hi. Question if anyone could help me. Im considering finding a dr and asking for this drug. BUT. I always thought that antidepressants or for people that were depressed for no real reason. It was simply a chemical in balance and no matter what was going on in their life good or bad they were depressed. Thats not me. But in the last 18 months, my mom has been diagnosed with dementia and majorly spiraled and theres a lot of insane sadness and anger and abuse that comes with that, my stepmom was diagnosed with colon cancer has had two major surgeries and is on her second round of chemo, my dad is of course a nervous wreck and hes already a hypochondriac overweight. The pandemic closed down my entire industry and career and I had to move cities back home to help my sick family so I have no friends here and no employment in the career that Ive been extremely successful in for the last 30 years. I finally found a boyfriend that I really loved and thought everything was going well, but we had two miscarriages and it went downhill really fast and we wound up breaking up a few days ago. My 16 year old furbaby is dying and the boyfriend took our dog. I also lost a couple of jobs that I really wanted and I really could go on and on about the nonstop bad things that of happened. I am able to get up in the morning and function and go to my few little jobs and hang out with my family and take care of them. But I am extraordinarily sad I cry multiple times a day. I had my 40th birthday this year and Im terrified Ill be alone and childless forever. I had a prescription for Valium and I have some left so I have been taking one of those in the morning and it may be helps a tiny bit. Anyway I guess Im wondering if I take an SSRI if it will make any difference if I dont really have a chemical in balance Im just currently having a really shitty life and none of those things are gonna change anytime soon. I did start talking to a therapist on an app but Im not sure I like it and may have to find one in person soon. Anyway. Should I take an SSRI?",

My partners depression gets extremely bad she is constantly sad and frequently has suicidle thoughts and gets very overwhelmed with her home life has asthma attacks and panic attacks for apparently no reason. I am running out of ideas i have done everything for her and i am continuing to do so but my mental illnesses sometimes makes it almost impossible to help and vise versa. She had said many times she wants to get better so bad and get out of her house when shes 18 so we can get engaged but she says she cant see a way out i have alot of experience with helping people out of suicide but the longer this goes on the worse i feel about how good of a job i do with her i used to feel very good about our phone conversations because my advice was always perfect she would go from a full blown panic attack anxiety attack to laughing with me making jokes and talking about all the things we were going to do in the future and how to achieve our goals now it seems like they end in her not actually feeling better just acting better or pushing the thoughts away. Please help me find ways to help them cope for the 3 more years they have in their house and how to help her get from the ground up as i have to do this 57 days now.",

I cant take deep breathes when im feeling anxious because it feels like im suffocating myself. I cant let something go because i dont understand what that means with thought because reoccurring thoughts are always present. I cant get past anything because my mind is too fucking powerful and only wants to feel terrible. Im useless, hopeless, amp this is all pointless.

    "I've given up trying to change because all I do feel less and less bad for myself when I fail Im an 18 year old male. Ive been able to do nothing but reject any help I get or fail trying to get myself back on track. Nothing really motivates me, other than distractions so Im not reminded that I wont be able to keep myself alive in the real world. Any support I receive now is all I rely on, and I have no reason to be lazy and unwilling to do anything about myself. Yet whenever I try, I always wind back to the start. I surround myself with positive people, but all I manage to do is shower them with support instead of myself. Ill admit, its because I know theyll use that support to succeed, unlike me. I used to be afraid that Id always be like this, but now its just a reality Ive accepted, and its made me bitter and unintentionally hostile towards those who know more about me than the carefree mask I put on. I like to think that when I get I job money will motivate me. It wont. Ill just be stuck in my own world and just accept the fact that Ive been fired after a week. Ive tried before. Its done nothing. Its a problem that affects all aspects of me. All of them. And it makes me feel like less of a person when I see others get back up from worse. When other people lash out at me for being defiant and wasting their support, or not being of any use or having any real reason to be kept around, I just sit there and take it with a blank face. They tell me things I already know, then try to lighten it by them just being angry in the moment, or just trying to get me to wake up. I know what they say is true, and I can tell that they hope to God that I come to my senses and start improving myself. Ive been this way as long as I can remember and nothing good has happened. Ive only become more numb to the situation and more accepting of my failure. I used to care. Alot.",

As if I was never born I know it sounds incredibly stupid but Ive been researching articles about how far science is from being able to extend our lifespans...but honestly with so many people always either being unable to do much or just choose to punish me, Im not sure how much longer I can last with this heavy thought of what comes after death A huge part of me just wants to kill myself and get it over with...

    "My friends doesn't believe in be and doesn't respect my wish to be alone for a while My friend doesnt believe in me and doesnt repsect my wish to be alone for a while. I have a problem with a friend in which I could really use some advice about. In mid dec. I told my nearest friends, that I need to be alone for a while. I was waiting for starting in a treatment with some therapeuts, and needed to step back since all the expectations from my surrounding became too much and left me up with anxiety. I cancelled christmas, new years eve and went on the sick leave. Ive been depressed since the beginning of last year maybe months before acutally when my now ex, broke up with me. And this has been the BEST thing Ive ever done to myself. I do have contact with my mum, who supports me 100. And a little with my dad, whom I struggle with. And this leaves me to focus on how to deal with him, since that relation in itself has been so toxic for me as well  so much that I didnt had energy to focus on it. Because I have so little energy atm. This one friend, lets call her ST is the one Im having troubles with. December was tough. A family member choosed to not talk with me anymore, December should have been anniversary day w. my ex  it reminds me of my sad little family, not so many friends and two earlier suicide tempts another ex  a dear friend. So Dec in general is a REALLY tough month for me. I went on the sick leave this Dec, because it just became to much. I then called ST to tell her about my choice  also telling her that earlier this year I was so depressed, that I tried to take my own life. But that Im not there anymore, but fear to end there if I dont take myself seriously. She got mad and told me that being on the sick leave is the most stupid thing ever  because I was ALMOST recovering, and almost starting up my own business etc. I got angry and told her that I just needed my friends to believe in me  and believe me when I said that this choice was the right one for me.",

I literally cant bring myself to get regular house chores done because Im depressed as shit. I feel like running away from home but I dont think there is anywhere to go for me because Im technically an adult and nobody cares. Besides it would put lots of extra pressure on me if I had to care for my own apartment and stuff like that.

And just before you think anything else while reading this, I HAVE NEVER AND HOPEFULLY NEVER WILL THINK ABOUT COMMITTING SUICIDE, I FEAR DEATH. I also dont pretend anyone to completely read this, I just want to get this weight off somewhere and that this remains as a testimony for anyone who can identify with it and if you do read it you have my gratitude, its not much but its the most I can give right now.

Mirrors are a source of unhappiness for me and even if I try to escape my homes mirrors I will often open the camera app of my phone to look at me and take pictures of my face because I dont feel comfortable with what I see. I have hundreds of selfies just to look and to analyze my face and I always get angry if I dont like what I see. I dont know how much the last thing is related to the following thing, but I am a very timid, shy and silent person however I never have a frown in my face in public because I am always open to talk to anyone because I really need someone to talk to me I thank and appreciate virtual messages and conversations but I need a real life interaction. I feel guilty because sometimes I transmit this feeling of helplessness, sadness and misery to my dad and my brother and I know my dad thinks theres something wrong with me and I know he is shy to talk to me about it. I am in misery right now, the last real person who isnt from my family who I talked with was last September and I still cant consider him my friend because I know how real and genuine friendships feel like judging from my childhood good friendships, I miss those friendships but those persons are now far away, now have a life of their own with girlfriends and friends.

    "Help I take 20mg fluoxetine daily for depression and have done so for 5 weeks now, Ive had minimal side effects and for the past 5 weeks Ive had a pretty stable mood and have had no extreme lows. Until 3 days ago when I had a massive breakdown and everyday for the last three days Ive had a meltdown crying, self harming, suicidal thoughts. What happened?

My girlfriend has got a fantastic, steady job and is always working long shifts nearly every day. I cant find a job anywhere and Ive just finished my 3rd year of law at university, so I have so much time alone. I downloaded Bumble the bff version to make friends but theyve slowly stopped talking when I dont message first I had tried to organise a friend meetup but it never went anywhere. I sometimes dont see anyone but my gf for weeks and its not for lack of trying. I do have friends but they all live in the city we moved from and have been really quiet. My supposed best friend has barely spoken to me in a few months. I just feel so lonely and desperate for friends. If I even had a job I could try making friends that way but its so, so difficult to get one.

    "Boyfriend doesn’t understand my mental illness... Ive been with my boyfriend for almost a year now and my depression has flared up and usually does when I am on my period. The issue is that my boyfriend doesnt believe in therapy and doesnt see it as an issue but my behavior is affecting our relationship. As much as I try to explain that I cant control it, that I am handling it, and that I would appreciate his support, he doesnt know how to support me and becomes distant when I try and open up to him about it. How do I try to help him understand what is happening and how to best explain my symptoms and what I need from him? Or is this just something that I cant talk about with him and is there a way that I can establish a code word when I start to feel bad so that I can have my space when I feel this way even though I would really appreciate his support when I feel like this?",
    "I have frightening intrusive thoughts I 21F have frequent intrusive thoughts and im trying to figure out what the hell is going on. I also posted this in anxiety but this may be a more relevant spot to discuss until i see my therapist in a couple of days. I mentioned it to my therapist and weve only met 3 times so its not really something weve been able to talk about all that much yet, since i have much more pressing issues relating to my depression and needing to discuss my past. My intrusive thoughts are violent. When i get in my head as we all do, i go through memories or my pretendscenarios that i also have playing in my head. If its something im anxious about or i dont like it, or just dont know what to do, i immediately have a graphic imagethought of me killing or seriously injuring myself. These images are usually of me stabbing myself in the heart with a dagger, banging my head against a walltable to find that a knife was there cut to me stuck hanging on the wall by my head, me hurling myself off a bridge, my fingernails being ripped off, me in a boat or plane propeller, turning my car immediately on the freeway... This kind of stuff. Some times Ill randomly have one of me being raped. Specific thoughts i have that trigger this shit is a conversation i want to have about something serious, but i get angry and cant handle it so i slam my head against a knife a memory of a cringey conversation from the past why did i say that?! slams head against knife memory of a bad boyfriend did a bad thing and i handled the situation terribly etc I dont know if im alone in this, I just want to know, and then if you were able to stop them, then how did you do it? Its really disturbing and scary despite me constantly wishing to actually disappear from the planet already. After typing this out Im more worried and Ive decided im going to mention it to my therapist with more urgency.",
    "Loneliness is taking over me I never realized how much I rely on having human contact and connection. I recently went through my first heartbreak and I lost a best friend and Im losing my other friend. I feel like neither of them cared about me as much as I cared about them. I feel like everybody has somebody that loves them back and for some reason that makes me feel worse. I feel like I give my heart entirely to people and it hurts so badly when its not reciprocated in the end. I know thats selfish of me but I wish I knew what I was doing wrong. I feel so alone and all I wish I could have was a genuine human connection. It doesnt have to be romantic. Just to have someone be there and not leave me. My depression is coming back and the negative thoughts are even worse than before. For the first time Ive really thought about giving up on life because I feel so useless and not good enough. I have one friend left but Im afraid to rely on someone to make me happy. I know it isnt fair. We talked and he made me feel better but when we dont talk the emotions come back. How can I be happy with being alone. I dont know what to do. I just want to feel hope and happy with myself. All I do is sleep because the days are too painful to live through.",

I was talking to a mutual friend of ours and I asked how she was doing without thinking. The news hit me like a truck, it felt like all the work I put in to slowly stitch my heart back together was for nothing. A week ago I was going about my life, happier than I had been in a long time.

My brain has been fried, neglected, and has deteriorated to the point where I may be able to understand complex ideas, but Im slower to process than your average remedial student. This is why I suffer at work and in conversation, I have to try very hard just to understand what people are asking of me and sometimes they just sound like unintelligible chatter unless I focus very hard. Its like Im underwater. Im completely incapable of multitasking and it costs the store money because of things I continually mess up and forget about. The only thing I have is speed and I can make things look nice, that keeps me scheduled. But Ive gotten lectured so many times about fuck ups. None of my opinions about the world are well received. I think that we need to get along by compromising and meeting eachother in the middle. People these days are to one extreme or the other. I feel even crazier not having anyone agree with, what to me, seems so intuitive. Nothing is right for me and Im so tired of feeling this much pain. I cant see a path to making things better or I would move towards it. Im not giving up I just dont have anymore options and I want somebody to just help give me some clarity. Ive watched people like jordan peterson and alan watts to try two different paths of fulfillment and neither works to calm my mind.

    "I'm lost again, I got caught I'm afraid. I havent been able to see a doctor, or a professional who can diagnose and help me, I havent been able to get up the courage to talk about this with anyone. I remember there were nights when I would stay up crying until dawn, where I just wanted to die, where I just wanted to end this pain that I didnt understand where it was coming from. This year there were people who helped me, I was in a very bad situation and they literally saved my life. And thanks to them I was able to help many people in need, especially many children, to see the smiles on the faces of people who have been having a hard time, to see the hope coming back in their eyes has been the best thing that has happened to me this year, I honestly did not think I would make it to the end of the year. My parents dont know, I have to be strong because we have been in a very bad economic situation and I have had to be the man of the house. My younger brother tries very hard, he is working very hard on a sports project, where he has to be concentrated and training seven days a week, and he has me as his anchor, so I always have to be strong for him. Ive been holding on, looking for ways to escape from this, there were moments where I was able to escape although I really dont know how long I managed to avoid it, there are songs that calm me down and make me stop thinking for a while, they make me feel like Im getting out of my head and going to other places, The song Dont you worry child has been one of those, the chorus that says Dont you worry, dont you worry child see heavens got a plan for you has been like a kind of anchor, but every day I feel it working less, the unexplainable pain is coming back out of nowhere. I dont know what to do, Id like to have someone to go to, Im alone and I have no one to seek refuge in. I had been able to keep it away, but it has caught up with me again, this feeling of Im afraid of falling back into the hole and spending every night crying and with that feeling thats like being stabbed in the chest or could get worse, Im lost.",
    "I want to slit my wrists but I know the consequences. So basically at the beginning of the year I started slitting my wrist because I started feeling overwhelming depression after 2019. My mum saw the marks and told me to stop. At the beginning of quarantine my depression took another increase, and for two days I started slitting my wrist again until my mum saw. She demanded that I tell her what was wrong, and I just told her I feel generally depressed all the reasoning behind it is complicated and plus I dont feel comfortable telling her. She asked me if a boyfriend had broken up with me or something, and that definitely wasnt the reason so I assume if she knows Im depressed shell think that. She then demanded that I dont slit my wrists again, and therefore I know that if I do, Ill get into a bunch of crap I dont wanna be in. I really wanna start doing it again Im a horrible person so I deserve it and hurting myself makes me feel better for some reason. Ive always felt guilt and shame, and self hatred, and I feel like my life has reached the end of the line I feel true happiness has faded, and the realisation has struck, that life is completely worthless and I will die one day, leaving everything behind. All motivation seems gone, and my life has just gone to shit, comparing it to the past. I really want to slit my wrist, but I know my parents would see. So what do I do?

Every time I asked people at the university or government what should I do to fix my problem. They told me to find a friend if I could not figure it out by myself.

However, when I told my problem to people that I met online in my the new country, most people would reply with, You should search people in real life or You seems put lots of chores to your friend or You should stop searching for boyfriend.

I am afraid of opening doors because I am scared of opening doors, because I fear there is something in the room, waiting for me. It all started with one crappy horror movie which was not even scary. It was really bad with huge logical gaps. I even laughed at it in the first place. But now? It is like my brain was rewriting the story just to intimidate me. But every time I talk to a family member it is just like it never existed. But as soon I close the door it is starting all over again. Every time I think I can sleep now, I just get the feeling again if something is approching me and heading for my neck. Even right now Pls guys help me. I am so tiered. I cant think anymore. This was the only thing that came into my mind. Maybe it is helpful to know, but I got ADHD as well. I dont know. Pls answer as soon as possible. Every answer will be appriciated And sorry for my bad english. I am no native speaker Thank you for reading it. It means a lot to me",
    "Heavy Shame From Drunken Past He keeps telling me to forget about it, not linger in that place, and that hes forgiven me, but how can he? Hes been this amazing guy, and I was unemployed for about two years there, along with the drunk crap, and broke up with him and then felt shame and apologised in the morning way, way too many times over. Im aware that Im just living far too much in the past, but I cant get over this shame. I need help. I guess I just want to know if anybody else has ever felt similarly, and maybe, what helped them?",

    "I think I'm inching closer towards being suicidal Im at my significant others place but that does not mean much. We called an Uber from a rave here and I vomited on my way here. My so could only take three people including themselves home so initially I wasnt meant to come because my so gave priority to my other drunk friends. Youd think theyd try to prioritize me by asking my friends if they could by any chance go home safely, but no I had to. Now I was left on the couch so I cant even sleep next to someone anyways. Theyre so fucking cold sometimes, I dont think they love me. Its 5am and I have cuts on my arm I impulsively made, I feel like death",
    "I'm lost in life Hey Reddit, so Im looking for some kind of advice here. Im 18 y.o right now, and I dont know what to do in my life. Right now Im studying in university for some kind of IT and security and I absolutly hate it. For the 5 days I havent understood a single world. So yeah, Im stupidnot judging just by the university, Ive always been like this, just sitting and dont understanding shit, also I got almost no social skills, I dont really like peoplejust kinda avoid them, Im not talented at anything, Im not skilled at anything and I dont like anything. Everything I do I hate, really hate. So yeah, right now Im in some kind of situation, where I dont really know what to do next. University is too hard for me, and I think I will drop out aftwr first exams because Im too stupid too understand this and hate this too much to force myself to study. I asked my friend about all this things and he told me some stuff like yo go find yrself, or yo, just do things. But it sounds stupid for me. Im so fcking tired of trying something, and then after investing time finding out that you suck at it, and also you suck at many many other thing aswell. I realise all those thing like that I need to try, because else I will never know, I need to talk to people e.t.c but I cant force myself to do it. Also I never had a girlfriend, and I dont think I ever will have one, because Im too uninteresting and unattractive to date me or even talk to me. I dont really look after myself because at this point I dont really care. And probably if I fail my exams at my university Ill just commit suicide, because I dont see a point in living anymore, I just need some kind of trigger to help me make that decision. If you give me some advice it will be very good for me right now. Sorry for that amount of text.",
    "The Story of This Year The girl came home and rushed me to hospital while the other one stayed at the party to get drunk. The girl was very supportive and stayed with me the entire time at the hospital, my other room mate, Max, didnt visit me at all. I considered Max a brother too me, I loved him dearly and I tried to do whatever I could for him to show how much I appreciate him. When he didnt visit me it really got to me and upset me. We spoke and he was angry and upset with me for doing what I did, so I left the house for over a week and stayed at the flat where I used to stay. I waited for him to calm down and I went home, I didnt want him to be angry and upset with me so I thought I would give him the space. I started seeing counsellors and psychiatrists. My counsellor helped me quite a bit, she was the first counsellor Ive actually enjoyed talking too and looked forward to seeing. We worked through my problems and she came to the conclusion that leaving the house would be for the best and she supported my decision of going back to college, so I did. After I told my room mates I was doing this they hated me. They didnt want to speak to me or see me. They said some pretty nasty things to me, and I back to them. I lost my two best friends, and my brother. Its been just over 2 months since Ive moved out and Im still miserable about it all. I think about them everyday and I see all their Snapchats together and it ruins me because we used to do everything together. Because I left my lease Im in debt up to my eyebrows. I had to come up with a bond and 2 weeks rent for my college and I have to come up with money for the bills towards the house that I still havent paid, and unable to afford. Ive taken out 3 loans since leaving which has put me through further debt and I dont know what to do. The last 3 weeks have been the worst for me. I havent stopped crying, Ive been using drugs and alcohol to mask my responsibilities and now everything has creeped up on me.",
    "My teen brother depressed during quarantine Hi all, This is my first time posting so I apologize if I miss a flair or something. First of all, Im a grad student living at home with family. I have a 16 year old brother that I live with, with my mom and other sibling father comes by often to visit. My bro has always been the type of teen to spend hours alone in his room, usually in bed, in the dark lights almost always off. He is usually on his phone and listening to music. Pretty typical teen stuff though the fact he sometimes spends hours in his room in the dark, not particularly doing anything, has always worried me. Since quarantining, so for about a month, he has become increasingly lethargic and unmotivated. He doesnt want to go outside for walks or drives. He is doing some of his school work, but missing meetings and other assignments. His sleep schedule is all over the place, I honestly dont know how much he sleeps and how much he just spends laying in bed. My parents are not the best at handling the situation. It usually results in yelling, sometimes violence, and my brother usually reverts more into his seclusion and silence. Im basically just looking for any advice. How can I help him? Thanks in advance.",

    "Advice when dating someone with depression? Hello everyone! Im here to just ask some questions on what did some of yall do to help your partners that suffer severe depression and anxiety. Ive currently been talking to this person and we both hit it off right from the bat. Im talking scarily accurate stuff that we have in common. This person then told me since we are talking more frequently, I figured Id let you know I suffer severe depression and anxiety. So its hard to keep in touch with people who have it and I understand if you dont wanna be around.clearly warning me that our convos wont be like this Of course my answer was I totally understand! Just know Im always around if you wanna ear to listen to  So its been two months now and I know some of yall would think why are you so invested, go live your life which I have been doing. But if it does work out and we do date for real. What advice can I do for me when im in this? This is just so im aware. In my eyes its clear we like each other, despite it only online. Ive tried to see if I could do what my friends told me and its to try and meet other people. But none of them clicked like how it clicked with the person Im talking to. They tell me she probably leading you on and I would simply say,  well why would they send 8 min audios about what were talking about? Or literally offer to watch one of my fav Anime in theaters the next month? Its her depression bro. Overall I understand her position and Im still living my life conquering my goals. But still in the back of my mind, if we do end up maybe being a thing. What would I do?",

    "I've been alone for so long I think I'm losing communication skills I felt like I resembled a corpse because of how dead inside I really started to become, and even became more and more obsessed with death and wanting to be dead. Now that Ive been shy and lonely for so long when I actually try to talk to people I have a hard time forming the appropriate sentence to match what the person had said to me. Or I might form the sentence awkwardly making my point much harder to come across to them. I feel like I have to stop and really put together a sentence in my head before I can say it or else itll just not make any sense when the person Im talking to finally hears my response. Or Ill hesitate while talking and then itll mess up the flow of what I was talking about and I cant piece back together the sentence I was trying to say. Ive slowly became more and more self aware at how many times Ive had to just completely scrape a sentence midway through because of this hesitation while trying to speak, people probably think Im crazy by now. I have nothing interesting to tell people either so when Im at work and the person whos talking to me shares a story about them that happened recently I feel like Im not given back to the conversation because I have no story at all other than depressing stories to share in the conversation, so 910 times Im simply forced to only comment about their story instead of sharing my own stories. Otherwise I dont talk at all, not unless someone else starts up a conversation with me. I kinda dont even like talking to people anymore because it just feels like its getting really difficult to make a conversion work when Im a part of it. Only being able to reply to their experiences instead of giving them insight on my own personal experiences. I also have a extremely difficult time looking people in their eyes for more than a second, maintaining eye contact just feels really uncomfortable. I feel so much pressure from other people too, like if I drop something I instantly feel like everyone is watching me as I pick it back up. Or when I was in school literally just standing up to turn my paper in made me feel like people would judge me for my appearance or how I walked or whatever.",
    "Should I keep checking in on a guy I dated for 4 months who disclosed he is depressed? I F28 have been single for 5 years and I know what assholes guys can be. But this boy was something else. Intiative, social, funny but deep down sweet and sensitive. He told me that winter gets to him and after a month he was starting to show signs of not sleeping and e.g. told that he didnt leave the house during the week but to go to supermarket. I started to get worried when he suddenly cancelled our weekend plans, and I said that it would be nice to know if he didnt want to see me anymore. He replied immediately that it wasnt about that and I told him to concact me again when hes feeling better. After a week he contacted me and I decided to give him another change. Then after a month he started to be again disconnected and finally I told him to come meet me and asked whats going on. He said that he has been feeling depressed for few years, but has now seeked for help. He hasnt told anyone else. I needed answers whether we had future together, which was maybe bad, since he had just come out of the depression closet for the first time ever... We decided that we wouldnt continue the dating. We both cried but I was pissed off due to the distant behavior that had been going on without excuses. I have now been texting him once a week. I started to get worried when he was saying that he hasnt really seen friends or doing anything. He still doesnt want to see me, even tho he said that some day he will when hes feeling better. His replies started to get more short and take more time. Now hes not answering every time. I asked if I was bothering him and that I could stop, but he sid that it wasnt about that. I asked if I could send him a text once a week that he would just open. He didnt reply. I have my own anxiety specially since we were dating and dont know whether I should keep texting him or not. There is mixed advice everywhere whether to not give up on a depressed or to give the person space. Sigh.",
    "I thought it would go away Ive been depressed since childhood. It was really rough growing up and I had a hard start. I pushed through so much and was finally able to get my degree and a great job. I make more money than I need, and I came from living in my car. I finally have all my ducks in a row and yet here is my depression. Almost three years ago I got put on 300mg Wellbutrin XL. For the first time in my life I felt what it was like to walk around without the lead weight in my chest. About eight months in, the meds stopped working and I had one of the worst depressive episodes of my life. They bumped me to 450mg which is the absolute max dose. Its been a couple years since then and Im worried the medication has once again stopped working. Im a 30 year old woman and Im feeling defeated by this thing. Is the rest of my life just me repeatedly defeating and beating down my depression? I think about having kids but I always think it would be so unfair for them to have me as a mother. What if I reach a point I cant take it anymore and I really do and up ending it. How could I leave children that way? I guess Im spiraling here. Just crying for no reason for the first time in so long and I know whats coming for me if I dont address it immediately. I thought if I got my life in order the depression would go away.

I have no one to help me either because my parents get mad at me for showing and signs of distress. My dad does will ignore me and give me the silent treatment and give me angry eyes if I ever tell my parents Im depressed. My mom will start screaming at me about how me being depressed makes her stressed out and how I dont even try to make friends but I do. Shell give me suggestions on how to make friends but Ive tried literally every single one shes given me, and when I tell her that Im simply suffering from a lack of social skills shell scream about how its actually that I look like a freak and a weirdo and that no one would ever want to approach me anyway. And its not like Im a bad son, Im actually better than most teenagers because I have straight As and because I have no supportive friend group that would invite me to things I dont drink or do drugs or have sex.

    "I wrote my letters To start it am safe, I am not planning on ending my life for now. I wrote my letters today. I wanted to see what I would say to my loved ones. They were surprisingly easy to write. 5 total. My exwife, 2 friends and my parents. The ones to my parents were the hardest. I know they are what had kept me alive as long as I have been. I dont want them to have to bury me. That is not a burden I want them to have. But having these letters written does give me some relief in knowing that if I cant hold back the pain anymore that they will know that I did my best and that they were wonderful parents. And that it was not because of them I am gone. That it was because of them I lived as long as I did. That my pain became too much but not because if them. It was my internal demons. So they will know that I held out as long as I could. so I have to keep going for now. So they will never see that letter. But knowing it is there if I cant keep it away in the future is a relief.",

Part of me doesnt want to stay in touch with him though. It may sound weird but I feel like if I lose touch with someone important in my life such as him, Id have an excuse to cut ties with everyone else. I know it doesnt make much sense. Its not only that though. I want to get rid of a majority of the things I own and I want to stop talking to people altogether. I wish I could just run away but I dont know what Im trying to run away from. I wish I could start life over again, but we all know that cant happen.

    "Depression after my scoliosis surgery Hello everyone, Ive had a surgery on 10th of February, since my scoliosis reached about 60. I was happy I was getting the surgery at first, seeing it as an investment in the future. Without it, I would have experienced extreme pain in later stages of my life. However, after i woke up from the surgery Ive been hit with nightmarish pain, unable to sleep for almost two days. Since then, Ive been worried if I have made the right decision. Hearing nurses say that people are recovering after just three days got me really sad, as i can barely move around in my bed without major pain. Im feeling really desperate, as if there is no escaping from the pain, as I feel plenty of it even under hospital medications. I had a friend that underwent the very same surgery, i looked up to her as she was able to live easily with it, as if she never was on a surgery. Unfortunately, I fucked up our friendship because I was a dick. I greatly regret it since now i see what she had to go through and how strong she was. Now I have no one to reach out too about this. If someone has any experience with a scoliosis surgery or can help, please do Thank you",
    "My depressed partner drains me So here is the thing. I know hes depressed and I know that he is busy with surviving day to day. But Im pissed. I sometimes get so angry and frustrated with him. He doesnt go to therapy and I dont know, if he really tried to get a therapist but the waiting lists are too long or if he didnt try hard enough. He wont tell me. Same thing with his job situation. I dont know, if he is searching and for what. Everytime I ask him, what he wants to be or do he tells me, he doesnt know. And I started asking him really deconstructed questions like what kind of activities writing textsorganizing eventsmaking statistic sheetsetc do you like? do you want to work alone or in a team? what goals helping people and what kind of peopleincomeetc do you want to be met? and so on. Its always I dont know. I am getting really impatient. Its been six years and he has so much potential that he doesnt see or use. Everytime I suggest something, he doesnt use that info, but feels stupid, becaus he didnt have the idea himself. Doesnt matter that I keep reassuring him that it is okay, to need help or not know everything on the spot. He feels stupid and blocks any further conversation and than i find myself trying to calm him down and in the end he promises me to change things, but never does. Probably because he really doesnt have the energy, I get that on an intellectual level. I understand it. I still feel extremely frustrated. This whole situation keeps our life on hold. It didnt matter to me for a long time. I always told myself, that he will find his way and that he will figure everything out, but now we are in our thirties and I really want to start a family. I want to get married and have children and start the next chapter. I cant do that with a man who barely survives. And it starts to severely affect me.",

Happiness is exhausting. Nothing is relaxing. Everything is just boring. Im either angry or Im numb. I dont even take showers to feel clean anymore. I just take them so I can waste time and feel like I can go to bed sooner. Heres my problem. I dont remember if I developed a personality before my depression took over. I dont know if I was a real person as a child, or if I was just a puppet or something. I feel like Im floating in life and I dont know how to develop a personality. Does anyone have any ideas at all where I can start? Things that used to calm me down just make me angry and frustrated. Thank you",

Things were okay. 4 days later he told me we talk too much, but everything is okay. When I asked why the sudden shift in communication. Often my friend would be the one to initiate the conversation, call me first or text me first. It was mutual. We both texted random crap throughout the day. As I dont believe I lost a friend, how do I proceed? Do I give space for a few days and see how things play out? Do I say sorry? Its bugging me of how to fix things.",
    "My life is amazing, but I'm a miserable asshole. I'm not sure what to do. When they announced the results a few days later, I didnt feel pride, or accomplishment. I just felt imposter syndrome I didnt deserve it, they must have made a mistake, they made it for political reasons and not based on my skill, etc. My current therapist says it has something to do with not being taught how to appreciate things  how to connect with that feeling of appreciation. Essentially, a deep feeling of notbeinggoodenough means I dont let myself feel the emotional rewards of anything until I feel Ive earned it, which thanks to the feeling, never happens. Shes probably on to something, but no matter the situation, I cant seem to make those connections, even if I can act on them. Maybe its a support thing. I have friends, but I dont ever talk to any of them. I dont have anyone that I tell news to when things happen  Ive tried, but all my friends always seem weirded out by my sharing. When I do talk to my friends, its brief conversations about shared interests, so always surface level stuff. My wife is incredible, but were so completely different. We have almost no common interests, have basically opposite personalities, and even our ways of talking are so different that we constantly misunderstand each other, so giving each other the support we need is difficult and foreign. I honestly cant explain why we have the bond that we do, but it is genuine, and despite the differences the marriage is strong, and despite not being able to feel it, we know we love each other and are loved ourselves. My social skills are, without hyperbole, autistic. I myself am not autistic, but conversations are impossible for me. I never know what to say, unless prompted. Someone says How are you? and I say Good, you? and they respond. If they dont say anything else, I dont know how to continue the conversation. I sit in awkward silence. Ive asked someone how they are three times in a row before. I know Im supposed to say something, but I cannot for the life of me figure out what it is.",

Most of my life she told me I never do anything or amount to anything and honestly. ampx200B I began pro wrestling and been in for about 45 years now, but I dont even have that anymore because of my limit of travel.

I do not have anything to look forward to in the morning, and I curse at myself for now randomly dying in my sleep. I feel like shit and the thoughts of suicidal grows stronger with each day. Make matters worse, it has become easier for me to gain weight and harder to lose weight as I age. So every time I eat, I just feel awful. Im going bald, my vision and my hearing is getting worse. Often told I look like a 40yearold man or something. ampx200B Hell, I cant even work longer than 20 hours, and even then it feels like it pushing it. Every time I work longer than those hours I get so stressed out and my depression grows worse. I could get more hours, but when I do, I feel worse about myself. But because I dont my family looks further down on me. I look down on myself, I feel like this waste of space lazy piece of shit.",
    "Is this normal? Hi, I dont know if this is the right place for me to ask this but I need answers from those who are in similar situations as I know depression can be tough. I am recently friends with this guy and he was a super nice friend. Along the way, he opened up about being depressed and all. For the past 3 weeks, he suddenly started to cut off our convos short and never made any plans anymore. Each text would end less than 5 mins with him telling me to rest, study or something. But then he came back like everything was fine. We also have a common enemy which he tends to talk about. But as soon as I talk about that person, sometimes he is supportive, but sometimes Ill be hearing remarks like oh, him again? or life happens. I dont think I initiate the talk about the enemy much but I do talk about him time to time when he, himself brings up the topic but then again, sometimes Ill face the same remarks. Am I doing something wrong here? I genuinely felt hurt by his behaviour and I want to know if this is something I should approach him about or it is because of his depression. I would really appreciate if anyone could confirm this for me. Thank you.",

    "I hate myself so much, I don't deserve to live I am probably the most disgusting person in the world, or at least I feel like that. I dont have many friends and that for a reason, I never grant people any success because I get jealous of it. I wish people unluck so that I can catch up with them, how pathetic. I think about peoples flaws and start judging them based on that. I develop a unnecessary hate towards them, gossip behind backs and more. I also feel like I dont really have any unique characteristics personality. Iam boring, I never have an own opinion, I just clinge to the opinions of those that I admire and plan on back stabbing them once im done with all the dick sucking. Iam just waste of flesh, i should have been aborted, and no iam not just in this mood at the moment, thats how I always feel, I realized it a long time ago but there is just not a cure for my hate jealousy and whatever sin from the Bible I embody. If God exists and if he truly punishes those who deserve it, than why am I not already dead. Also why cant I change, why was I born this way, why was I bullied so hard in high school, why am I gay, why could I never experience love till now?

    "How to tell my friends that I’ve been having suicidal thoughts? Trigger warning suicide 19F This has been one of the lowest points of my life. I wont go into details as to what is making me so depressed, but I realize that I really should talk about this with someone. For a while about a week, I was actually set on committing suicide. I started planning it out in my head, was even planning out letters to write to everyone, but a part of me knew that this was the wrong decision. Even now, Im about 5050 on it. At this current moment my mind is more clear, so I just know that I should really tell my friends and get help before it gets to a point where I actually go through on it and start overthinking it again. I have 4 very close friends. Weve been through a lot together and mental health is something we all take very seriously. While I am planning on seeing a counsellor, I just really need someone close to me to know what Ive been going through. Im not able to tell them in person due to covid restrictions, so it has to be either on call or through text. I just really need suggestions on to how to go about this without freaking them out and how to even initiate this conversation.",
    "I could use some help ;D Its not what you know. But who you know. Been ghosted after my 3rd interview. What makes it worse, is knowing who was hired the industry is very connected online. Said other person had less experience and a worse degree than I. I must really suck at interviews or lack enthusiasm. All feedback I get is, you were great, but we went with someone else or you lacked enthusiasm when I smiled and did my best to be interested during the entire interview. The gaming industry is very altrustic. Ive been stuck as a permatemp for a 1 year 7 months. I have a first degree and a lot of experience. Employers still dont see my value and I dont know what else to do. Ive turned to alchohol to numb the pain, and its gotten to the point I dont care if im fired and lose my job. Im greatful for the opportunity, but im stuck, not learning anything new and I have been rejected from multiple opportunities at the company im currently at. I constantly aim yo better myself by asking for more experience, but im ignored. Then why am I kept and renewed contracts? Make it make sense. At this point, from my already nonexistent selfesteem, ive concluded im unlikable, too honest and its not what I know, but who I dont know. Alchohol is literally my best friend. I such at networking and hate the idea of sucking up to potentialy get somewhere or nowhere. I hate the gaming industry, and I hate what its done to me.",
    "My girlfriend died and then before i could get any closure for myself covid came around and i haven’t even gotten a chance to talk it out with anyone To begin with i am a 17 year old guy, who used to be in a four and halfyear long relationship. Now, initially, we were just best friends who thought of the term girlfriend and boyfriend as a special friend and decided to well start dating. She had an insane amount of problems on her side of the family, her parents were in prison, her siblings both dead and a shit ton more. So a big chunk of our time was me supporting her, comforting her and so on, and well i ended up getting really attached. I was so close to her that i ended up developing somniphobia which was something she struggled with and not me. 2 years ago my grandfather went ahead and killed himself, which came as a massive shock to both of my parents, who had spent over an year to get him back in shape both mentally and physically. During that entire time span, I ended up being neglected and would only talk to my girlfriend. We were very close and would talk almost 45 hours daily, so when she got caught up in a car crash and suddenly passed away, i didnt take it well and i still dont. Neither my parents nor my siblings know anything about this, since my household is not supportive of relationships till i become 18. Its been almost 11 months now and i need someone to help me get over her. Anyone have advice how to? Ive tried a lot of stuff such as Meditation Gymming Exercise Focusing on studies Therapy None of those helped me that much, would appreciate some advice!",

Trying and failing again and again has left me incredibly exhausted, and Im just beginning to find the hope again. Im currently working up the courage to look for a job and start living my life.

    "Loneliness It has come to the point in my life, where I just feel lonely. I know that there are people close to me, that there are people who care about me, but sometimes, I just feel lonely. I usually enjoy the feeling of being alone. I love sitting at a bench in the middle of nowhere in the darkest of night, when noone is around and nobody but the stars sees me. But I hate this loneliness... It creeps into me like a dagger, slowly pushed into my heart, wraps my brain and emotions in a blanket of coldness, softly whispering in my ear that Im alone...that no one really cares about me... I can fight against it, I can entertain myself to not feel it. I can figth it by talking to people, by making silly jokes or watching YouTube or playing video games. But sometimes, in the middle of the day, it comes creeping back to me. It seems to be around me all the time, just waiting for the moment, I let my guard down... Just waiting to close its hands around my throat and rip my heart right out of my chest... Dragging me down into an ice cold sea of nothingness and loneliness. I know this demon of loneliness is wrong. I know, that there are people who care for me and who like me... But still, I dont know how to win against this demon.",
    "My friend says she's depressed but doesn't \"seem\" so and it triggers me Hello, Ive struggled with depression diagnosed until last year, so Im pretty familiar with the topic and mental health in general, which is why I suggested my friend, who was having some problems at school and some angry issues, to talk about it with our school counselor. She went there twice and shes now convinced that she has depression, I didnt say anything because I dont want to invalidate her feeling but honestly I dont think so but again, im not the one who should say it. First of all, she told me the counselor didnt mention it, but made her understand it in a subtle way. Also, she doesnt exhibit any signs of depression, she doesnt have a lack of interest in doing things, or a change in appetite. I feel very bad writing this, I know every depression is different, but she has no problems going through the day, and its always the one to ask to hang out for example, while I couldnt and sometimes still cant get out of bed in the morning, let alone function properly. All of this makes me feel extremely uncomfortable, every time she talks about it with idk what to say because I cant really empathize with her. She also mentions it a lot, which makes me even more uncomfortable, like the other time she was like oh, we are both depressed, what a great couple! and I was like wtf, first of all Im not depressed, and then I know it may be a way to cope with it but it sounded really bad.",
    "Trouble with persistent fatigue- not medical Hey all, I am a 24F who has dealt with depression for about 9 years with varying severity. I am currently on Effexor after trying a bunch of meds and stable enough that Ive held down a FT job for 3.5 years and now have a livein partner. The details of my days, however, arent great. I dont have energy or desire for hobbies beyond cooking dinner sometimes and watching an evening TV show with my boyfriend. I often find myself mentally exhausted and ready to shut down either at 5pm after work or later on around 8.309pm. It gets worse on days when Ive struggled with negative thoughts. My partner doesnt really like how I go to bed early a lot, and is hurt that I dont want to stay up and spend time with him. I want to not always be so tired. After getting bloodwork done last week I know this is 100 psychological my Dr. knew about my fatigue but said my results were great. Id like to be the kind of person who goes to the gym or for a walk after work but I always feel too heavy and sad. I often dont want to be awake if I could just be asleep and escape feeling sad negative tired. What can I do to fix this? Has anyone been in a similar situation? Thank you.",

    "When to walk away.. Hi, I 29F have been seeing someone 29M who suffers from depression and anxiety. Right now it seems like his depression has gotten worse where he has a low sex drive, sleeps all day, is gaining weight and has started smoking again. Hes told me he wants to stop seeing me but when I ask him how come he just says he doesnt know or is overwhelmedconfused. And that he thinks he doesnt like me the way he thought he did when we first met. Ive kind of tried to get him to elaborate but he said theres no point in evaluating it. I was hurt but in the back of my head I cant help but think is he self sabotaging? Is this his depression thats overwhelming him and clouding his judgment? I asked him if he was pushing me away because he didnt like me anymore or if he was too overwhelmed. He said he wasnt trying to push me away but that hes not well atm. I told him I cared about him and that Ill respect his boundaries and give him space for now. But after reading posts on this sub Im even more confused, should I give him the space he says he wants or should I continue to try and be there for him physically and emotionally? Am I being naive? I suffer from depression and anxiety as well so I sympathize with him and from my own experience Im known to self sabotage. Id want someone to fight for me and thats what Im doing for him but idk how to tell if he truly wants me to fight for him or not.

    "i had to say goodbye to my sweet boy today after finding out yesterday cancer is ravaging his body. the vet said he has never seen anything like what was shown on those scans, that my sweet maximus was a very very sick little boy. the inside of his spleen was supposed to look like peanut butter, but instead it looked like chunky jelly with chunks and lumps he could not identify. his body had developed multiple tumors, which were cancerous. he had gone into tumor lysis crisis meaning that a large amount of the cancer cells that were comtained in these tumors died, and released their cancerous contents into his blood. they were killing his red blood cells and destroying the ability to regenerate any at all. his stomach had bloated 3x its normal size, even though it was just later in the day and yesterday morning it had looked fine. the vet discouraged us from treatment because he didnt see any possible way maximus could recover putting him on treatment would only prolong his suffering and ensure he passed painfully. which is cruelly ironic, as putting him on treatment would keep my suffering at bay. but i have to do right by my boy. hes been through too much and endured more than i can imagine, he was brought into this world in pain and i promised him when i brought him home he would leave it in love. i had to keep that promise. i love him more than it seems like my heart can handle, and making the right decision for him is the absolute utterly wrong decision for me. we got the vet this morning and despite not moving except to lift his head the past few days, he trotted off away from the building. i believe in the deepest place of my heart he knew what we were there for, and he was scared. he wouldnt let me turn him around back toward it, and the most he would take was two steps toward the building and then sit back down. i sat down with him and just sobbed. the thought of not having that big brown baby rips my heart into shreds and pierces my soul. we finally got him inside after i just sat with him and talked to him for about 15 minutes. ive never wanted to simply wait in a waiting room longer, but they called us right back.",
    "Is this depression or something else? I noticed my bf had been acting off kind of aloof and withdrawn lately but every time I asked he said he was ok and just tired. Last night I asked again and he said hes ok but when he got home he told me that he doesnt feel right mentally like if something is off. He just wants to lock himself in his room all the time and he said its been a few months like this but that he is just now noticing it. He said he has low sexual attraction and Isnt in the mood much and is disgusted with the thought of sex but still loves me but its just more pure? Now hes had little bouts like this before and so I asked if its like the other times and he said no that he feels just blank. It sounds a lot like depression but I am not sure. Ive told him that he should go to the doctorphysiologist to get this checked in the past I almost got him to go in the past but the office in his network in my town did not have any appointments until several months down the road which is crazy IMO but he can be very stubborn on this. He usually gets out of them eventually but I get really worried and concerned for him and I dont want him to suffer with this. I wish I could just make it go away. Im here because I need help in determining if this is depression or something else and asking for your advice on things we can do to get him help  Im going to try again for the doctor  phycologist but I know its going to be difficult to get him to do this practically and things he can start doing that can help him get out of this.

Idk if this will help but Im willing to do anything. Please Id really love some insight and help.",
    "Did you or anyone you know, get out of depression? I am having suicidal thoughts, and I try all sorts of things to make those thoughts go away. I havent had professional help yet not much money in my pocket right now. This led me to wonder whether depression is curable in plain words does it really end?. Do the sad thoughts just go away? If not then, how do you deal with it differently now? If yes, then what steps did you take to reach this point?",
    "i just want to be important to somebody im just a background character in everyones life. nobody cares about me. never had a shot at shit. relationships, important endeavors, nothing. at this point i just want it to end ad for me to die. im just a helpless disgusting creature. what do i even say or do? all i hear is the same bullshit of youre loved the world has a place for you . maybe if i believed that i would want to fucking wither away and die. fuck everything",
    "Hi, I'm 16 and I need help, I don't wanna relapse. Hi, Im Blake. Ive had depression since I was 8 and I started Zoloft and Lamictal at 14. Ive had a lot happen to me, I think all of us have. Ive been doing better. I quit porn or I havent orgasmed to it, Ive tried being nicer, and Im working on being a better person. The issue is... Ive been an asshole to my parents as of late.. I made my mom cry with how I dont respect her. Ive done so many fucked up things in the past, stuff I cant even speak of. I try to forgive myself, but I cant. I just wallow in self pity when I get sad and play the victim. I have been the victim, yet I use it as an excuse at times. I need help forgiving myself for the things Ive done, they haunt me every day. I say Ill change, and I do for a while...but then I relapse. I cant accept that I need to feel shitty for the things Ive done. I would like some advice, real advice, on how to forgive yourself even after continuously messing up after you say youll be better. I need help. Thank you.",
    "How do you get out of a bad depression episode? You know, the ones where you cant get out of bed. You try to act like nothing is wrong when you call your mom or something, because you dont want to be burdensome and add to the problems in their lives. But you wish someone would come in and check on you... it took me hours to get out of bed and to shower. I just got out the shower, now back in bed, and I hate to wallow in sorrow but I feel so bad. I want to curl up into a ball and just disappear, the mattress empty, I am gone. No more pain for me, no more pain for others. It just ends and the world keeps going.",

I keep procrastinating all the time. I just watch pointless stuff on YouTube and browse memes on Reddit all day. I have terrible sleep hygiene and cant get out of bed by 10 AM.

    "Alternative Treatments? After almost a decade of therapy and meds, Im officially treatment resistant. I dont think I can keep going with how I feel but I dont want to give up. So Im looking for alternative treatments to typical psych drugs. I 21F have depression dysthymia, cyclical depression, anxiety GAD, panic, OCD with dermatillomania, and PTSD. Im currently on Pristiq and Abilify but they dont work. Some things Ive tried 1. Dozens of prescribed meds Zoloft, Prozac, Xanax got addicted, Cymbalta, Buspar, hydroxyzine, bupropion, Trintellix, Wellbutrin, etc. 2. Therapy talk, exposure, acceptance, etc. 3. Supplements NAC, ltheanine, caffeine, vitamin B, vitamin D 4. Illegal drugs mescaline, LSD, LSA 5. Legal drugs Siberian motherwort, dagga, CBD not in a legal marijuana state, kava kava tried today, helped but worried about liver  interactions with other meds I cant afford ketamine therapy. Id consider microdosing LSD but I dont have access to it currently. Anyone got any other ideas? Im kind of at the end of my rope here.",
    "weight gain due to depression I was wondering if anyone could share how they deal with this problem since im not coping with it at all. Been gaining some weight lately so today Ive tried throwing up and later on cutting myself for eating too many calories. I do realise that making yourself throw up or starving yourself isnt clever, however, I turn to these toxic behaviours as a way to punish myself. Its been really hard staying on a proper diet since junk food is a way of coping for me. Scared of working out, cause Im afraid to see how poor my performance is. I have nowhere to turn, so Im asking for help. i feel shit mainly because I lost 10kg by working out and eating well half a year ago , gained all of it back. Feeling incredibly disappointed in myself.",
    "I just told my parents that I had depression, it didn't go well at all. I know my parents went through alot, but they should take such situations seriously, no matter where you got born or in which century. Im still very grateful for every single thing they did to me, they raised me well, they gave me all my wants and needs, but this time....it just slapped me in the face and im so shocked. What should I do ?",
    "How do I convince my parents to let me see a therapist? Basically, they are the religiousskeptical type, so they think God can cure my depression if you believe in that all the power to you but didnt work for me and now Im basically atheist, not trying to disrespect anybody though. And yeah, so they refuse to get me an actual therapist for around 5 years now Ive had depression and they knew the whole time, Ive self harmed, came close to committing suicide, starved myself a bit, and skipped tons of school over those 5 years. Still no help, even after I got school counselors involved in middle school, they barely did anything. But to give them credit, they somewhat tried to get help after I involved counselors from school, only since it was basically required. Except this person they chose to be my therapist was the pastor of a church I go to, and he invalided everything I felt, and even worse last summer he practically made fun of teens with depression and said it was just mood swings and it was fake. Dumb stuff like that. I dont want to make this post any longer then it needs to be, but thats a tiny bit of background. I just want a bit of advice on convincing them, because I seriously need help. Any tips on how you the reader convinced your parents, or tips on making them believe therapy works would be helpful. Thank you.",
    "My family keeps pressuring me to find a job and finish college but I just can't do it I am 22 falready and I know I should have found a job years ago but I dont know if I can do it. My head does not function, I cant concentrate on absolutely anything. I think about how useless I am everyday. How I cant talk to people, how am I supposed to get a job like that? I keep thinkin no one will hire me. Months ago I actually got an interview but I couldnt go, I had several panic attacks on the way. I just couldnt do it. My anxiety levels are so high I sometimes dont even eat cus I dont want to buy food. Idk what to do, I already fucked up my life  I guess Im just a useless pos. How can u guys ever make it into a job?",
    "What would you do in my position? Youre crying over a girlIm relating to that one year I was victimized. It didnt help that my brother is also illogical and not as mature as me. Hes younger than me but I was more matured than he was when I was his age. But everybody is different. Thats was me trying to say everything in short terms. And here I am present day. Quarantine made me feel more alone than anything. I thought I was used to dealing things on my own. These experiences that Ive faced really made me think that theres no one that understands me. I do these small things that no one does and I have a valid reason for why I chose to do it, but no one understands what Im saying. I feel extremely excluded. Even to my own sexuality. Everyday I feel different. I feel so unnatural. Im thinking its because I became unsure of who I am as a person because I changed myself so much. To make others more satisfied with me. I wanted to not be lonely. But changing myself made it worse. Death threats were made, insults about my physical appearance were made everyday, and I had no one to talk about it to. I envisioned my life being so happy 1 night. I had a friend who was caring and really nice. He was a true friend. I think what Im trying to say here is that I feel so unloved and excluded. I feel that no one cared about how I felt. I had no one to talk to my feelings to so I became more irritated over little things. And no one in my life bothered to understand why. They thought I had lowtemper. Which is not true. Its really hard to explain all of these mix emotions I have in me. I remember my mom told me that I rely on others and not my parents. I could never tell them that I tried many times before that which came to no avail. Im not diagnosed either. I always lie on those doctor depression paper thing because my dad watches me fill those out which raises my anxiety levels. Also a side note Im a person who is fearful.",
    "My wife has turned heartless, and it's making my whole soul want to writhe out of my body Im pretty sure my marriage is over and I just dont know what to do. Most would turn to their friends but I have none. Some would turn to their family, but my family has only anger. Ive been horribly depressed most of my life, trying to kill myself at 8 years old. I have tried not giving a fuck and its just never worked. I have no outlet for this feeling. No part of it is acceptable. I constantly say to control myself, but I hate myself so much. I dont know how to heal or to accept this path that she assures me Ive chosen. I just want to keep my family together. I love this woman more than I have ever loved anything in my whole life, but she doesnt see it. I love my kids and their probably the only thing thats keeping me alive at this point. I dont know why Im posting here. No one can tell me how to flip this situation to one where I succeed, thats up to her.",
    "My boyfriend is depressed, I want to help the right way Hi, so Im not sure if Im right here, but my boyfriend is having a severe depression since he is maybe 14. He is getting help since one year and takes serious dose of medication. Weve known each other since eight month. He is lovely, he is just the right guy for me and in my eyes he is perfect. He actually is always tired, in this state most of you probably know, but I think he is getting a little better. Only he has those phases where you just feel nothing and at the same time kind of despair and dont have any selfworth and I cant find the right words really. I hope you know what I mean. Well I dont know what to do. I always offer him to talk to me and say what he currently is feeling, only if he wants to of course, but he just says that since it is the same thing every time he just needs to get through it. I dont know if that is good for his mental state this believe, because I think he thinks he is troubling me by talking about this, but it is not. I have told him that I will listen even if it is the same thing every time and that he does NOT waste my time! Still I feel really helpless if he is in this state of mind and Im not even sure if I should say anything. And if you guys can tell me if there is anything you would like someone to say, do for you when you are in this state of mind, could you tell me? Maybe that will help me to say the right words, or show him my support the right way or that I should just leave him pass through it.. I of course realise that everyone in their depression is different and that there is not the right way, still maybe it helps.",
    "Need help Im a 32 year old female who recently lost my daughter. Shortly before that both my parents were diagnosed with stage 4 and 5 cancer lung and colorectal and are on their death beds  I have had to quit my job to care for them full time. I cant get out of bed and havent for weeks  I cant eat and am down to 37kgs. Ive been in hospital with a feeding tube but took it out and discharged because I genuinely dont want to live any more. I have no one to talk to and I dont see any other option. Ive tried to be positive for so long but I feel like I have no energy left to try anymore.

    "DAE Want to reach out for help but know it could just make you feel worse? Im going through a backslide right now and I almost want to ask those around me for help on things like checking in to make sure I got out of bed today or have eaten something since I have a tendency to starve myself. I feel like I should be open about what Im dealing with, but I also know that if I do, Ill feel weak, like Im putting my illness on their shoulders, and that theyll suffer because of me. I was suicidal not long ago and I feel myself returning to some of the thoughts that accompanied those feelings. I feel terrible for what I must have put them through, thinking I was going to die and the last thing I want to do is put them back in that position. I feel guilty asking them to help me because I dont know if they can break me out of negative cycles. Only I can get myself in a healthy mindset. Asking them to help feels selfish since Im bringing back all their worry when Im not sure they can really help. Is it a bad idea to fight this alone? Has anyone else experienced something similar?",
    "I'm 25y/o female from India. My depression keeps coming back in waves that pushes me into a full blown breakdown every few months. I don't know what to do. How do I get better? I have struggled with depression for a few years now. I live in a conservative family and my childhood was toxic, abusive and lonely. Things keep coming back to me now as I grow older. But Ive learnt to use my coping mechanisms and get better every time I start to fall into the darkness. However, two months back I had to deal with an abusive episode at home and I have not been able to bounce back. Im jobless. Im preparing for a competitive exam that requires me to study for at least 10 hrs a day and clearing it will mean freedom for me. All other options I have dont lead to freedom for me. Ive invested the last two years of my life in this and now the exam is just five months away but I find myself unable to even get out of bed on most days. The best day Ive had in two months was when I somehow managed to meditate and study for 3 hrs. Im fed up struggling and Im losing hope. But I want to get better and I want to be able to function and meet the demands of my life right now. I dont have the money or family support to consult a professional for help and so Ive come here as a last resort hoping that someone will be able to show me a light. I want to get better so bad. I believe its possible for me to create the life I want. Im just unable to see a way out of this darkness. Please help. How do I get better? What do I do to be able to stop feeling so lost and study? P. S. Due to my lack of access to a therapist Ive learnt all the tricks like exercising, meditating, Journaling. And Im trying these but nothing is working. I feel no joy even in things I used to love.",

    "I got into rpg commu to escape reality but It made my depression got worse. Im 22 years old who currently struggling with film thesis in my senior year. My thesiss topic is hard and its stressing me out. And I found this community where you draw a character and roleplaying with others character in some sort of setting like MMORPG. So I decided to use it to escape from some stress from my works. But it turned worsen. I have no friends there and its like everyone is knowing each other. I know the fact that I didnt active much because of my works and Im kind of confident in my drawing and painting skill Im parttime freelance artist. But nobody played with me or make their character talk to mine. I got anxious so I tried to please everyone by praising their characters in introduction posts or asking for our interactions of our own chars. Some didnt reply my message. In the last 5 days, I got sleepy entire day, lost an appetite, I only ate a small meal or snack once in a day and insomnia. I felt left out. So I brought my account to follow their public account with feeling that If I befriend with them maybe theyll be interact with me ? Some of them turned out fine. But theres one who seemed to hate me because stupid me had bad choice of words when complimented their char. At first, they didnt know Im the owner of that char, they seemed happy enough but once they knew the truth, they seemed off and didnt talk to me since. I know its stupid to give a damn about mimicking world where those members came from wherever in the world. But its so stressing when you feel like talking to a brick and everyone treats you like an air. Please say something, I really need support",
    "Is it okay to drop a class for the sake of my own health? So I am currently in college. I am in my second semester as a freshman first year and I am an undecided major. I was leaning towards computer science or graphic design, but this CS170 class is stressing me out. The class by itself doesnt sound too bad. But thinking about the homework, which the professor warned could take up to 6 hours outside of class to complete, is what stresses me out. When I think about my other classes like Religious Studies, World History, Geology, and Design, I dont think I can handle the work load of CS170 PLUS the workload of the other classes. I know that this is a stupid request and will probably be removed, but Im the kind of person that relies on advice before deciding something important like this. Any advice could be helpful. Please and Thank You.",
    "Depressed person trying to support a depressed person I thought it would be easier to think of ways to help someone I know who is showing signs of depression because I too am depressed, but its actually so hard. I know just being there is such a big part but Im NOT there and cant be, we live across the country from each other. How do I let someone know Id be happy to talk to them as long as physically possible if they wanted to without it coming across as babying or OTT, because I truly would stay up for days talking to this person if they wanted, or even if they didnt, I love them so much, I love talking to them and I think theyre such a cool person, and want to convey that without it coming across as mollycoddling. They called me last night in the middle of the night whilst drunk, which they never do, and when I got in touch this morning they text saying they pressed the wrong button not possible unless theyve made no calls in the last two weeks, they would have had to search for my number and call me and joked about being at a friends student halls this week and feeling so alienated, Im worried about them. I told them to give me a call when theyre back home to tell me all about it but now Im worried theyll take that as me not wanting to talk now, which they might want to. Ahhhhh its difficult, trying to strike the balance between showing you care and not treating someone like a child is like, impossible. Any tips, or advice on what you would like to hear from someone if you were in this situation? Or maybe Im overthinking it all too much? Haha, this is so hard!",
    "What happens when you get better? This might sound like a ridiculous question, but Ive started to think about what things would be like if I was better. Ive started some new meds and have no idea if they will work but I dont remember what it was like to not be in dark place mentally. What if I dont know know who I am without depression? I havent had an extended period of a good spell for 15 years, this started when I was about 12 so I just dont know what things would be like if the meds did actually help. Is this a silly thing to be anxious over? Anyone have any advice or been through this too?",
    "I don’t know what’s wrong with me... I have no reason to wake up in the mornings I have just been feeling lonely, empty and purposeless. This has been happening on and off for over 5 years now, maybe longer. Every now and then Ill have a few good days but the bad ones never seem to end. I wake up in the morning and just want to go back to bed even tho I have so much i could do. Its like I have no drive or motivation. I dont know why Im here or what the point of my life is. Everything seems to meaningless and I just cant seem to find my way. Ive tried hobbies, hanging out with friends, talking to people... but its all so temporary. Im yearning for love and attention and when I dont receive it from my significant other, it cripples me. Im too needy and insecure and dont have any sense of self. I feel like thats going to cause my relationship to end as well. Ive tried therapy for years and it helped temporarily but then became another meaningless part of my routine. Any advice would be appreciated on how to overcome this slump and become a whole, independent and happy person..",
    "Are depression and anhedonia part of getting older? Most of my post pubescent life I have dealt with depression, but its only gotten more frequent and more extreme as Ive gotten older. Lately Ive been experiencing total anhedonia, where my favorite game, movie, music dont make me feel anything at all. Hanging out with friends is almost exhausting, and I have to fake being positive and laughing, etc. Is this just part of growing up? Is it time to finally start devoting my time to purely practical things? Joy is just for children and young adults? Im 25 years old, btw."
