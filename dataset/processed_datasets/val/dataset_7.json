    "To medicate or not.. About 2.5 years ago I was diagnosed with depression  anxiety no biggie. It runs in the family, its a biological depression as one side of the family doesnt produce enough serotonin, so nothing actually happened to me to set it off. But it affected a lot of things that I wanted control over, I wasnt living my best life. I went on medication Venlafaxineffexor, and it helped dramatically. Though I gained 15kgs in the 6 months. So I came off. Ive been good for 2 years, I got the weight back down, and Im hovering between average and athletic. But recent changes in my life have stirred the pot. Mirtazapine is a recommendation that should work differently and not cause the weight gain. I dont want to go on the meds again if Im going to gain that weight back so fast. I dont want to be on meds my whole life like my family members. But nor do I want to stay like I am currently. So how do I decide? Flip a coin? My psychologist and psychiatrist havent been able to help me make my mind up. Anybody been on mirtazapine? Does it cause weight gain and kill libido? Not that I have a libido at the moment anyway, thanks life",

    "My mom is depressed and I don't know how to help her Hi everyone, this is my first time posting here so let me know if this this isnt the right place. ampx200B My 20F mom 58F has been depressed, to some degree, for as long as I can remember. Were a pretty sad family all together honestly, but thats all Ive known from them. ampx200B For some backstory My dad 61M fixed up my grandparents old house the one my mom grew up in over the course of a few years. The old house was falling apart, and my dad wanted a new place to renovate before he got too old to do so. My mom never wanted to move in, but reluctantly agreed once my dad pointed out the benefits. ampx200B So here we are, a year after we move in, after all the garage sales and selling the old house, getting rid of sentimental items we couldnt keep and all the junk we didnt want. And shes spiraling, guys. Ive always been her person to vent to, since Ive been alive. And every night she tells me just how tired she is, of everything. How she misses the old house that they spent over 30 years in, how she hates every tiny thing my dad does, just blaming him for everything. She cried into my arms tonight asking what she has to look forward to everyday, to just tell her something good in her life to look forward to. And no matter what I said she would just cry harder. ampx200B I dont know what to do to help her, if anything. I know my dad isnt going to help because they argue just about every day and havent got along in like.. 15 years. My mom doesnt have many friends either, just her sister and some people she cleans houses for. Is there anything I can do to help her on the bad days?",
    "I'm begging someone for support rn. Anyone I was wholeheartedly convinced she was the woman I was going to marry. Eventually, after I had gone to jail, she decided to leave me and fucked 3 of my best friends... at the same time. It was complete betrayal, and thats when I realized I was truly alone. No friends, no family, it really fucked me up. Thats when my anxiety started to peak. The last few years of high school, I was addicted to cough syrup and would go to school tripping every single day. It destroyed my social skills, and fucked up my mind permanently. Eventually, after turning 21, I turned to alcohol. For the last 4 years, Ive drank basically everyday. Im at the point where I just hole up in my room, drinking around 18  20 drinks continuously everyday. Nothing is more terrifying than alcohol withdrawal. Ive gone to the hospital on numerous occasions for it, and every morning and night Im absolutely convinced Ill die of a heart attack. My 2nd gf I met 4 years ago. Finally, shed had it with my addiction and irrational behavior, and she left me. The thought of her being with another man crushes me, and Im at my lowest point. I cant stop drinking, havent showered in weeks. I have alcohol withdrawals constantly, and I cant even rid myself of the pain because when I start to drink again, its constant vomiting. I have nobody, and she was the only one that I had. Id call her at the end of everyday, and atleast I had someone to back me up. Ik its so cliche, but really she was my only hope. Im just really at the end, and just need someone to tell me it gets better. My life has been aweful since birth, and I just cant find hope. If you took the time to read this, I really appreciate it. I hope someone talks to me",
    "I hate this paranoia I have this paranoid feeling that im being recorded in my own house by my boyfriend. I know its not true he has NEVER done anything like that I know where it comes from. My abusive mother got this small video recorder when i was 12 and set it up in our house without me and my brothers knowing. It was absolute hell. She took away my last sense of privacy. Ive been paranoid ever since that when i live with someone they are secretly recording me. How do i stop this?? Its driving me insane because i know logically its ridiculous but i cant convince my emotions of that. Any help would be appreciated.",
    "I want to get help but I'm scared of having a diagnosis on my record. So Ive finally hit the point where I think I might need to get help professionally, in the form of seeing a psychiatrist or therapist or whatever. My issue is that Im paranoid of having any sort of mental health diagnosis on my medical record. What are the pros and cons of this? The first thing I can think of is the fact that I own a decent amount of guns Im not suicidal, theres no reason it would be unsafe for me to own them and Im worried they may take them please leave personal politics out of that issue. Other than that its mainly just being scared of whatever, if anything, Im diagnosed with following me around on my record. Any one offer any insight? Im torn between wanting to get better and just leaving well enough alone.",
    "This is a cry for help... My story is a little bit long so I apologize for that. Im a step away from suicide. Ive been dealing with depression for at least 19 months now, and everything sucks. Hi there. Im a 19 year old boy from Iran. First let me make it clear that Im an atheist and this is story isnt from a religious perspective. But Iran has a religious culture and government which has affected this story. I grew up lonely. My mother and father were never there for me. They just had a lot of expectations from me cause I was a smartass kid. But they never really cared about the pressure they put me through or my feelings. I started dating when I was 18. Yeah, a year ago. How did I start dating? It was my last year in high school and I was studying the shit out of myself to get accepted in a great university. Just 5 months before the big test, I was so sick from the pressure. I needed someone. I needed someone to love, someone to love me. my family sucks. So I started dating this girl who was the same age I was. One thing I need to explain to you guys is that relationships in Iran are really different from Europe or USA. They proceed a lot faster. I know its wrong. But its part of the modernreligious culture that you live in. For example you have to say I love you in the first month. Crazy, isnt it? Also most relationships in iran dont include sex. Cause most people in iran believe that hymen test is scientific. And doctors are making money of this myth. Fuck. So I started dating her and we dated for 2 months. I became extremely obsessed with her. I loved her so much. Please dont judge me for that. It was my first serious relationship and I completely fell in love. She told me the same. But after 2 months she told me that she cant get her ex out of her mind and broke up with me. Making me realize I was just a rebound. I spent the next 8 months completely depressed.",
    "Advice and help please TLDR Im underage, depressed and dont want to involve my parents in this. I dont have any friend support right now either. Not sure what to do now and feel like just giving up. Im 17 this year and went for a free mental health checkup a few days ago parental consent and knowledge not needed which confirmed that I suffer from Major Depressive Disorder. Ive been feeling the symptoms for a little over a year now and attempted suicide a few months ago. Now that I have confirmed that I have depression, Im not sure what to do next. They recommended that I look into getting a psychiatrist and psychologist for medicine and counseling respectively, especially since my family has a history of depression. However, since Im underage, I need parental consent. Im not close to either of my parents or any of my siblings and I have quite a lot of bad memories from my childhood as well. Additionally, my father has quite a negative perception of depression which definitely would not help. My younger brother has had suicidal ideation for the past year as well his school found out and told my parents so my mom in particular is very concerned about him. I dont want to burden them further or open up to them about this at all, and since my brother is not mentally well either, I feel that my parents should focus more on him. At the moment, none of my friends know about this diagnosis and I dont intend to tell any of them either. I pushed away my two closest friends a few months ago and I dont trust anyone enough to tell them either. Even if I did, I dont think they would be able to help much ranting does not help me much and just makes me feel like a burden. Im pretty much completely alone now and have no clue what to do. It feels like my only option is to tell my parents even though I really dont want to and they may react very negatively. Also, Im very tempted to just let this get worse and worse until I eventually kill myself so that hampers any attempts to get better as well. Any advice if possible?",
    "How to work in school with depression? Its no secret that school and depression do not mix well, but currently I am demanded of it so I must fulfill societys insatiable hunger for my misery. How must I complete school work when all I can manage to do is focus on eating and trivial tasks. Im on depression meds but they do not work 100 percent and I still cant focus. any advice?

    "What helps you with your insomnia? I remember how relaxing and fulfilling it was to sleep when I was a kid. I couldnt get enough of it! I slept with my blankie, I sucked my thumb, I snuggled, I was never cold when the window was open, and I hated having to wake up for school in the morning. At 14 I first got depressed and started experiencing uncomfortability during sleep I was always very cold. Then, at 18, I got into a depressive episode and with the pressure to study well at uni my social anxiety increased. I couldnt go out during the day because I felt like all the people around were judging me for not working hard enough, not looking well enough, and other things. So I started sleeping through the day and living at night. Now that Ive worked through social anxiety it is not quite so bad and I enjoy getting up early in the morning because it feels like the proper and healthy way to go about my day. However, no matter how much or how little I do during the day, I cant fall asleep at night. Im just not tired. Its kinda like leaving the car running Im not doing anything, but the thoughts are racing inside my head. Ive tried the 478 breathing technique, progressive muscle relaxation, but nothing seems to work. I also try to eat early and let fresh air into the room. What helps you to calm down before going to sleep? Thanks for the answers, I love everybody",

I feel like nothing I do is good enough or worth anything. I feel like my son doesnt love me. I feel like Im not my own person, like my life doesnt matter.

Ive slept most of the day, each day this week. Ive barely eaten anything other than chips and junk. Nothing I own or could stream seems worth watching. I consider myself a gamer, but everything I could play seems like a waste of time and energy. I dont even want to work or make money because whats the point if everything you could buy with those earnings is just going to sit on a shelf. Its not just right now either. Ive always felt like this. Its just exacerbated to the level its at now over the last year or so. I take medication per my physician, but I feel like its so hot and cold on if it seems to do anything at all. I honestly dont expect anyone to give me any meaningful advice... not the first time Ive decided to scream into the nether  probably wont be the last.",
    "How can I support the man I'm dating who is depressed? The guy Im dating has been having a tough week due to two things happening and I think it has triggered his depression hes told me about his mental illnesses before. Our relationship has been amazing so far but this week he has been really quiet with me and doesnt want to talk, and now it has come to leaving my messages on read. Im really concerned about him because I dont want him to feel he has to suffer alone, but I also understand that everyone copes with things differently, and perhaps he just needs to get his thoughts in order before talking to me again. Ive sent messages telling him Ill always be there for him and nothing will push me away, and I know how rough it can be because some of my family members also suffer from depression. Ive also told him I will give him space to think and get his mind in order and that he can message me anytime he feels like talking, but I do want to keep checking in on him over the next few days to show Im there for him. If anyone else has any advice on how I can support him, then it would be greatly appreciated, thank you.",

    "Skipped school to kill myself, didn't go through with it, what now? Please help me, anyone. Hopefully this all makes sense, confused and tired right now, and Im going to not go through and reread anything like I usually do as I know I would probably just end up deleting this post, so hopefully this isnt too confusing. Itll also be long probably, sorry for the long read, but I need to at least get down all of what happened. Just need some advicesupport, or whatever please, Im not really sure what I need, like I said, Im not in the best state of mind currently. ampx200B Ive skipped school maybe 56 times this year when things were too much, as school is one of my biggest stressors and I dont even see the point sometimes, just to get a mental break. Ive never done much on those days other than lie around, or maybe play some video games if I felt like it. These were the worst days for me, constant suicidal thoughts since my parents and brotherssister wouldnt be home, either at school or work. These are the days that I kept toying with the idea, feeling safe in a weird way, I know that I could kill myself if I needed to. I havent skipped for about a month or so, but all throughout yesterday I was thinking as I get closer and closer to graduation, theres a time limit of sorts on when Im actually going to go through with it, as it gets closer and closer I feel more pressure that I have to do it, because I feel like I need to kill myself before I graduate high school, Im not sure why. Today I woke up at 630, and as soon as I got up I was already battling with the idea of whether or not to go to school, and this thought stayed with me throughout breakfast, throughout my shower. I told my brother, who I normally walk to school with, that my alarm woke me up late and that hed better walk to school ahead of me if he didnt want to be late, so he left. I literally did nothing for the next 30 minutes to an hour, literally felt nothing, just thinking about what I was going to do.",

I lived in that situation since so many years and as is it the mother, shes right and not me.

    "Angry Issues Causes Everyone to Leave, Should I Be Alone? I have always had anger issues and an attitude that no one has ever liked. A lot of my family, friends, have experienced this side of me and either refuse to talk to me altogether, ignore me, or block me and remove me from their lives never speaking to me ever again, even if knowing them for years on end. So lately Ive gone off on family and friends and it made me feel bad afterwards. But now I feel like I want to just be alone. Not talking to anyone at all, because if I dont then I cant get angry or show my ugly attitude etc. Part of me just feels terrible and I just dislike who I am as a person. I want to be a better person and for everyone to love and care for me, but all I am doing is pushing everyone away. What would you do?",
    "I changed physically I 27f recently got a dramatic haircut and gained weight about 5kg and was too depressed to do anything about it. It lead to acne, hair all over my body and face Its getting worse with my need to be validated and I feel that the more needy I become the less people reassure me or want to interact with me. My social media likes have gone from 100 to 0 real fast and I have no self esteem any more. I wonder if I whined about my image too much and if my friends just hate me now or got sick of me.

    "What if it’s scientifically impossible to get better As the the title says what if its just scientifically impossible. Think how millions of people commit suicide, whos to say that any of them had a chance of getting better. While sure other people recover from depression, we all know depression works on a scale, whos to say there isnt a cut off point in which there is literally no hope for recovery? Obviously we dont know everything about the brain so this is entirely a possibility. I dont know if this is even requesting support to be honest as, I feel like, as my post suggests, support might just be useless and Im destined to die depressed.

I have also been depressed for about 3 years now, after I had been bullied by some  friends  in middle school, 7th grade. 8th grade was even worse, I had lost all my friends, and had turned into a loner. My freshman year was the same, and the teachers even started to pick on me. Thats when I left, and decided to stay at home and do online school. Both of my parents are hard working, so they couldnt stay home with me, so I had absolutely no motivation at all to work on school, and barely passed. I am now a Sophomore and only have online friends. I overthink EVERYTHING to the point where I cant even text my friends online anymore, because I worry I will say something weird. It has never gotten this bad, I used to be funny, and I didnt overthink as much. I was almost outgoing. I dont know what to do.

    "A cry for help I live with abusive parents. Im 18, but unable to move out because the Covid situation is really bad in my country. Honestly all my hopes of staying alive were latched on to the fact that Id be able to move out by the end of 2020. But things have been so bad, quarantine has given my parents the right to basically keep me under lock and key under the farce of protecting me. Theyve broken the locks to the door of my room, and often my father is physically abusive. Both my parents are emotionally abusive. Every time my father is done beating me up, for months nobody in my family talks to me. Ive suffered from a complete mental breakdown, for a period of time I believed I was dead. I called a child helpline but I chickened out when they said theyd come over to my house to help me out. I talked to my school counsellor and she made me apologise to my parents for disrespecting them enough to call a helpline against them. I genuinely cannot do this anymore. I havent slept at night for weeks on end. Every time I try to sleep, I wake up suddenly and am unable to sleep again. I wrote down a suicide note yesterday. I made a reddit account today because Ive the tiniest bit of hope left. Ive studied so hard all my life just so Id take a Student Loan and move out for a good college, but all of that has fallen through.

    "Need advice o how to help my SO who is suffering with depression. Sorry if it's not the right place to put this. My SO is suffering with depression and anxiety and is refusing to get help. Its almost like he just doesnt want to. In fact he has said on multiple occasions that he doesnt want to get better. It all started when we had a termination for many different health reasons on my part. That was a good 6 months ago now. I went straight back to work afterward and he just didnt. All he is doing is burying his head in video games, he doesnt leave the house, doesnt help around the house or anything. We have been trying to get him to see someone and he just flat out refuses. He self medicates as well and I dont think that is helping at all, in fact I think it maybe contributing to the problem. But anytime anyone brings it up he just says that it isnt a problem. He did start to take some antidepressants but has decided that he isnt going to take them anymore. I know we cant force him to get help but he needs to do something. I have been trying to support him by giving him space and letting him do his own thing, but that just doesnt seem to be working. I just dont know what to do anymore. I am scared to bring any of this up to him as he just gets very defensive and nasty towards me just to clarify its not physical its just hurtful. Need some advice on what I can do to help.",

    "I think my boyfriend left me due to his depression and I need some help to understand and deal with this situation. Im so confused and dont know what to think or how to help him. So... Im not sure how to phrase my question or even what exactly Im looking for... I guess I just want to hear some other thoughts on this. Does anyone of you ever left a partner due to your depression? Is it possible that his depression is so predominant that there is no space to develop intense emotions for another person?",

Its really stupid of him, like for example, yesterday we were going somewhere and he came in my room and said its time to go. Okay. No problem.

    "Tips on not distancing friends? Also, what options are available to get therapy with your parents being able to intervene? I been in a downward spiral. I have had forceful intrusive thoughts of suicide. It like someone nagging you, but you just think of those words over and over. This is the worst its ever been. My parents arent allowing me to get therapy since my mom said nothing is wrong with you, you can not go because they may give you medicine. I understand she is worried and doesnt want crazy written on my personal record. her words not mine I was looking forward to join a free program called better hope, but she said there wasnt enough knowledge. I had a serious break down where I talked to my friends, and the comforted me. I promised them after this I wont need a shoulder, so I wont bother yall. I was hopeful that my mom would green light it. So, now Im just need help, but I pushed everyone away. We still talk, but it feels wrong for me to unload. I been feeling really selfish from the times I did try to talk to them.",
    "Finding the right psychologist I was seeing one who was great for the first 3 years and then started really pushing CBT and mindfulness onto me, despite me saying multiple times I hate both of those approaches and they dont work for me. I havent seen anyone since December and I think I need to. Im going downhill again. How do I bring it up that Im not doing CBT, mindfulness and homework sheets. My GP offered to write a letter to my old psychologist explaining all that, but my anxiety is too high to go back and be questioned about it. I hate all of this. So much.",
    "Depressed firefighter ends things My 30 f ex boyfriend 34 ended things from depression at the beginning of the shut down from covid. He told me he didnt love me anymore almost 3 weeks ago. I dont know if this is how he really feels or if its the depression closing him off to feeling anything. I havent spoken to him since he told me. But I go back and read older messages leading up to the break up and I see him telling me hes struggling with the depression but he tells me how happy I make him and how much he loves me and I keep him afloat. But once he hit a really bad rough patch he closed me out completely. Has anyone experienced this before from my position or even from his that could give me some insight of how their stories progressed with their loved ones as the depression lastedor while you or they got help? I believe in my heart he does love me and the depression suppressed those feelings. You dont just have those feelings disappear from a happy relationship without some type of issue going on. Ive been dying to reach out to him but I was the one that said I needed to heal, but with the riots going on and him being a firefighter and his mother telling me he said the therapist is getting him to open up I want to reach out so bad. Can yall share your stories and give me any insight on his possible feelings or what people did in my own personal shoes? He is the love of my life and losing him has been the hardest thing Ive ever experienced. He also has never dealt with depression before so its entirely new for him. Thank you for anyone and everyone that can help or atleast share their own experiences.",

I told her that I am unmotivated to do something for school, go outside with friends dont even have some or even clean up my room.

    "I feel like a waste and I don't know what to do. Where do I begin? I guess to start, I recently got engaged to the love of my life back in June youll see why this is important in a second. I am also in a very demanding work industry, in education. Special Education to be more specific. I love working with kids and it can be very rewarding, however, its the most taxing job. My fiancé is a very supportive person while also keeping me realistic. My dream is to stream and I used to and it was fairly successful, to my surprise, when I started. I gained a lot of followers, viewers, and even a few donations even though thats not why I started to do it. My stream was focused on just having fun doing hobby and trying to shine light on mental health. My 1 passion in life is to help others. And I have tried to find careers that revolve around that, but to much dismay. So my stream was to offer advice when asked, listen, and just talk. Talking helps. Even talking about random things. Anyways, she supported me while I did this during the summer. I knew it bugged her that she had to go to work every day and I got to stay home and fulfill a passion of mine. I am drowning at work and it has completely taken over my life. I find no joy in my old hobbies. Watching sports, playing video games, hanging with friends, etc. This past week my fiancé told me that I remind her of a hermit. I hate going out, hanging with friends, all that. I hate having fun is what she told me. Frankly, I realized this before she had told me. Furthermore, I am faced with the decision of resigning from my job and chasing my dream. The repercussions of this is that there wont be stable income coming from me, my fiancé doesnt make enough right now to support us both and we talked about it. We were looking to buy a house in the next year, as well. I feel like Im a waste though. Do I just nut up and suffer just to achieve the goal of getting a house?",
    "Am I a wuss? So Ive been living with my roommatefriend for like half a year. I think Im a decent enough roommate I clean up after myself, help out, blah blah blah. Anyway I was making dinner for us. She chopped up the pasta sauce ingredients and I made the sauce and pasta. So basically I used too much pasta for the amount of sauce I had. Honest mistake I think tell me if Im wrong please!. She got frustrated and lashes out. Essentially calling into question me as a man and as a cook. bottom line was I got hurt and ended up crying. Now this worries me for a few reasons. The last time I was too sensitive about being insulted was around the time I had a breakdown. Basically it felt like my emotions were sunburned and any little negative comment pushed me over. Also those kinds of things attacking my manhood and pretty much anything negative about me has been a sort of depression mantra when Im upset lots of negative thoughts rolling out at once. My question is this is it possible Im too easily triggered? Or maybe the particular subject matter was a significant trigger? Or maybe am I just a wuss and therefore not much of a man?",
    "I have a problem with getting mental help. My parents are a bit off. If their friend or a family member needs help, they will put their entire life on hold. But if their kids need help, its rarely done. Ive tried for months to get them to make a few doctors appointments. Specifically my psychiatrist. But no matter how many times I ask, it never gets done. In fact, about six months ago, I went to the dentist to get some cavities filled. I had cavities on the top and bottom sets, so, they said that we would have to come to two separate appointments to properly get them filled. Well, we went for the top set, and Ive asked my parents to schedule the second appointment ever since. However, my main concern is going to a psychiatrist. Mainly because for about two and a half years now, Ive had problems with the way my brain functions, and my grasp on reality. I just havent felt right. But in that time, I never considered going to a psychiatrist because i had been to one before, and they did prescribe me medication, so I thought that if there was something wrong, they would have found it years prior. But i spoke with some friends about it and they told me it would be smart to go back. That was a few months ago and I havent been able to convince my parents that I should go back. Its not a financial issue, my insurance covers everything And its not a time issue, neither of my parents are working. My parents are the There aint nothing you cant fix yourself type, and dont understand much about mental help. Its getting so bad that my mother wont hardly talk to anyone because shes either too lazy, to too buried in some kind of device to do anything. Then, when I ask my aunt or grandparents for help, my parents get pissed and complain about how I make them look bad. Dont get it wrong though, they are great in most other regards, but when it comes to me actually needing help, they really dont do much. When it comes to real responsibilities, they are just all around lazy. If anything cant be solved within a minute or two, they wont hardly even look in its direction.",

    "Want go back to my life before all of this. Please help! How can I get over this obsessive fear of others opinions? It is ruining my life Im not sure if this is OCD, but I 19F have been dealing with intrusive thoughts for almost 6 months now. They are somewhat similar to POCD, but I get gruesome intrusive images of men abusing children it is never me, and I also get intrusive thoughts like what if she is being abused and what if that father is a pedophile who is abusing his child?. I think I have these thoughts because I absolutely detest and fear child sexual abuse, more than any other act in this world. The thoughts are distressing, but I have been able to use online resources and tips in order to decrease the amount of thoughts. Lately though, I have been worrying over the groinal response, which is debilitating. I could tell immediately that it was not arousal. And it usually doesnt happen at the moment of the intrusive thought, it happens while I am ruminating and when my anxiety is at its peak. I can tell that this truly doesnt mean anything because of the fact that it just happens when I am super anxious. I could be watching a tv show involving nothing sexual, and get a groinal response due to anxiety. Though, whether I am anxious about being aroused by the gore in the show, I dont know. I think one of my fears, that lines up with POCD, is that I would EVER be attracted to any form of sexual child abuse. Because I used to watch shota as a child and read inappropriate underage fanfiction, this fear has somewhat tangible evidence. Even though I was the same age as the characters, it still disturbs me. I know for a FACT that I have no interest in children, and that I never have I am attracted to men at least 5 years older then me. This groinal response has me questioning though why would I have this if I did not fear being aroused by children? . Even though this technically doesnt mean anything, does the groinal response indicate that I think I am a pedophile? It is confusing, but I guess my fear isnt that I am a pedophile because Im not.",

But once we matured and got over it, we started seeing each other again. Ive always had feelings for him, but have kept them at bay. Hes very aware of these feelings because Ive told him. However, he doesnt want ANYTHING more than booty calls and the occasional sleep over. Hes honestly kind of an asshole, but I am so fucking infatuated with him that it scares me. I find myself constantly checking to see if hes read my messages or is online or has posted something. I cant stop thinking about him. I try so hard to keep myself distracted with work or hobbies, but my mind immediately goes right back to him when its all done... What do I do? I want him to show some kind of emotional bond towards me, but I know thats not something I can control. I need help accepting the situation Im in.

The internet often gave me that impression. I think Im weak, I definitely do, but I dont know how much. I dont know if poeple are just agressive pretentious entitled assholes that think their opinions make them somehiw better than everyone or Im just being too sensitive and itd just the way poeple state their opinion, I dont know.

    "How can I (28f) help my Mum (56f) who is depressed and considering suicide. Previously they had a friendly but distant relationship without regular contact. Calling me and my sister at all hours of the day and night in tears mostly when she is drunk to just talk and keeping us on the phone for literally hours her last call to me was 4hrs and 42 minutes at 10pm until she feels better or passes out. This occurs approximately twice a week to both of us. Previously we would text regularly and call about every 710 days. Refusing to deal with anything concerning her Mothers my grandma, 88f increasingly poor health. She started doing this as she suspects that people think she is trying to kill Grandma which is completely unfounded. She had previously been the main point of contact for the local council and doctors for anything related to Grandmas care and has had medical power of attorney for abut a decade  a sibling has since taken over responsibility for facilitating Grandmas care as a direct result of her behaviour. She has begun drinking increasingly heavily over the the last 2years. Currently she consuming 12 bottles of wine most nights, has very recently starting consuming spirts in addition to this. She is routinely drinking to the point where she is passing out in her own vomit. Previously she was only a light social drinker. Frequently making statements such as just wanting to die, I should just die, someone should just shoot me, ill just die. This is happening multiple times in the same conversation, it must be adding up to hundreds of instances per day. There have been many other behaviour changes I have noticed but the ones listed are the ones that are new to her and are alarming me the most. For further context, she lives alone in a country town, does not have a significant other or any pets and my sister and I both live hours away from her and have done so for years as do all her siblings. She has had some major stressors in her life recently. Obviously Coronavirus has been a big thing, she is an essential worker and has been working the whole time. Her employer has recently sold their business and she is very concerned about her job stability when the new owners take over. Grandmas health has been worsening and Grandma is resisting the idea of going into a care home.",

    "How do I support my girlfriend who is struggling with depression? Hi, first time poster here, I hope this is an appropriate post for this board. My girlfriend is struggling with depression, probably stemming from childhood trauma unstable family situation, regular police presence in the house. She is taking large doses of venlafaxine 225mg for 120lb body weight to cope with her illness, but it can only do so much. She often has problems controlling her anger, which is related to the point of this post, because when she is in a depressed mood, anger is often the only way she can really communicate. She recently had a complete nervous breakdown in the car I was driving, over an argument we had. It ended with her calling an ambulance on herself to be taken to emergency psychiatric care. She is now considering some time in a psychiatric institution for herself. Now here comes my main questions She often has these breakdowns, where she often can only shout and scream, or completely retreat. She describes it as such She can either scream, or say nothing and retreat to sleep for a day. I have found that I am very unhelpful for her in these moments. I am a very careful person, and I think a lot before doing anything. She says she needs guidance and structure in these moments. How can I support her in those moments? I have tried to give her clear instructions in those moments in the past, but it has not worked well. I think my personality type just does not make it very credible if I say Calm down, were doing X now, because I dont behave like that in a noncrisis situation. I think her anger is often a frustration about her inability to deal with her illness. Unfortunately, her behavior in those moments also scares me. So I am even more timid to help her. Not that I am scared that she will hurt me or anything, but I am scared of making it worse. Also, I quickly become frustrated if i try something and it does not work, which is an issue I need to work on. ampx200B TLDR How do I support my depressed girlfriend during a mental breakdown? Anyone out there who can relate to her behavior and knows what works for them? Any advice welcome!",

    "Should I kill myself? I am the most uninteresting person and I feel like I am the only one who puts effort into any of my relationships. Ill call her Kayla. I have actually blocked of so much of my memory of her, like I remember maybe 3 or 4 moments over a year and 8 months or so of dating. We started of pretty good, but I believe we were both immature and didnt know how to set boundaries or handle a relationship. Which is what led to a lot of fighting. I do remember we fought a bit around a year into the relationship because she kept cancelling plans with me to go out and play games. Like I never tried to get in the way of her friendships, but she cancelled our anniversary date, and just a few other dates we set up literally the evening before or the morning of to hang out with friends. I told her that I wanted her to hang out with friends but the constant cancelling plans with me and not trying to reschedule was hurtful. Ahh, a lot of it is coming back now. I would honestly say we were a bit codependent, she relied on me for emotional support as her mother was extremely controlling, I relied on her for my social needs. Not a healthy relationship. We ended up breaking up after growing a bit distant, and at the end she played a bunch of games with me. Her mother didnt want me dating her which was the main reason we broke up. So she told me if I can convince her mom, shed let me get back with her. I didnt do this of course but I was distraught. I felt like I had nothing. I started playing piano in grade 11 but quit while we dated because of the effort it took. Most of my time went towards school and her. I ignored a lot of my friendships more than I should have during the relationship so I was in a terrible spot. It made me realize how unhealthy a person I was. I had struggles reaching out to the 3 friends or so I had because I always questioned whether they liked me. But when we broke up, they were there for me.",

    "Are my feelings valid if I don't cut, or harm myself? I feel like this is a hard topic for me to approach, but I would like to express some things Ive been feeling. Before we start, I would like you to know this is going to be very long, and explaining things that happened in my life, and what I am feeling at this moment. Thank you, all. Truly, Im not sure if I am depressed, but at this moment Im not willing to seek out help, outside of virtually. I hope you all understand that. But I am sad, that much for sure. I cannot express really in words what I feel, other than the fact than waking up is seeming to be a struggle at this point, always feeling overcome with such a gloomy feeling, where if anyone pushed me Id be constantly on the brink of tears. The entirety of being constantly upset, trying to cry, trying to find a way to let out the emotions which you didnt even know you were feeling, but being so empty, you cant even muster tears. I believe I started feeling these feelings around a year ago, after getting out of an abusive relationship. I became so dependent on one person, that I thought I couldnt cope without them. I made excuses for everything they did in my head, and always ran back to them. When they blamed me for their suicide attempts, because I didnt show them enough affection whilst they were hospitalised, though I do not know if she was truly hospitalised, or if it was another facade, I broke. I sent over 100 messages a day, as I knew this would happen if I would not, but she didnt want me to feel happy, despite anything. Not even in the simplest of things to brighten my spirits per say. Anyhow, I had to discard my friends, she had complete control over whom I talked to, and whom I wanted to be friends with. And she forced me to choose between her and them once again. I picked her. It may be irrational to some people why I would do it, but when someone starts convincing you how much you need and rely on them, with all the things youd planned together, with what you said, the words they, and you, said. Its so hard to turn away.",
    "Just wanting to be a normal person Ive always had depression but it seems like this last year it has really escalated to another level. I normally keep my apartment cleaned up, sometimes Ill have some mail sitting out or need to do a couple dishes but it always stay tidy for the most part. My depression has been so bad the last six months, I havent touched my bedroom. I have heaps of clothing around my bed, I have like six bags of trash I need to go drop off at our towns waste disposal, I have no groceries and just keep getting cheap 2 fast food burgers, and I just dont care about anything. I work and come home and sit on the computer or go lay down and end up spending the rest of my day in bed. I just want to do normal stuff, I want to come home to a clean place, cook dinner, take a shower and relax like any other adult but its like physically tolling. Help",
    "Am I really THAT bad? I want these companies to relay to me exactly why they rejected me so that I can improve, Or else I want them to change their decisions, So that not giving up becomes a reality for me as much as it does for anybody else you tell it to!!! Do you want my life to not be worthless? Do you want me to keep on going? Fix this for me! Somebody fix this!",
    "Depression, procrastination and graduation Hello, thats my first post ever on reddit. I am in huge trouble and I put myself there now I need to face this but I dont know what to do. I always had panic attacks and alot of stress since I was just a child. but when I started university it doubled and I came to the point last year where I couldnt get out of bed, let alone study. I closed myself off and didnt get out of my room for a month, That had consequences on my grades and that made me hate myself even more. I used to be very disciplined, a grade A student so that felt like a punch to the guts. Anyway, this year I have a graduation project I need to work on. I thought I learned from that past experience but I really didnt. I was procrastinating out of fear for 5 months now. whenever I start I just start trembling and cant concentrate on anything Im reading. that led me to withdraw from poeple, my teacher my friends because Im too ashamed of my behaviour and I cant face them. Im in deep shit I want to get out of this but I dont know how. This is not how I thought my life and my view towards myself turn out . PS I was taking medications for anxiety and for depression but I stopped them now .",
    "Looking For Coping Methods My depression has been really declining lately. I live in a really bad household and Im being targeted by my grandfather whom nobody will stand up to and if I try to stand up for myself, Im the one in the wrong. Hes been yelling at me over small things, calling me all sorts of names, leaving stuff at my door for me to trip over, and more. This especially hurts because him and I used to be friends when my mother was the one being horrible and nasty She calls me disgusting, a few slurs, etc he was the one that was always there to comfort me and try and talk it out with her. Now, however, it feels like that never happened. It feels like I was the one who did something wrong, and I dont know what. Its seriously effecting my relationship with my boyfriend, friends, and myself. Its an incredible struggle to eat just a meal a day, my lips are getting torn because I pick at them, I cant ever get to sleep and stay asleep, its frustrating and since Im a teenager I cant leave this enviroment. What do I do to cope? I use music to try and melt away, I play games like animal crossing to stay distracted, I draw, I play ukulele, I just breathe and try to remember that it will pass. Im terrified of being suicidal, Ive attempted once and was lucky I know Im capable even if I dont want to and that scares me. What are some methods you guys use to deal with these sort of things? I desperately want to get better, but it feels like I cant here.",
    "I'm getting angry at my depression. I want to break out of it and I can't seem to shake it. I wasnt able to complete homework because of mental fog and everytime I opened my online class dashboard I would break down and cry until I fell asleep. I did a few assignments and it would take me half the day to write a 2 page paper. Took me a week to write a 6 page paper. I used to be able to do them in a few hours. I feel like my mind is deteriorating. Conversation is more difficult. I can easily explain my feelings because its a trait of my personality, but casual talk and reading people has become impossible. Im getting anxious because talking to people I already know is starting to feel like talking to strangers. Ive been crying my eyes out over small insecurities I used to be over and accept. Im trying to figure out how to reorganize my life but its so hard. I know people who go out and party and drink night after night and still go to college and go to work and are doing great. They are happy and healthy and only have a small nagging guilt about not getting more done. I feel like I produce NOTHING of value to the world and its so difficult to just chip away at learning a song or doing a simple assignment or task at work. All I can listen to is super depressing music as well if I want to enjoy it. I feel like a emo highschooler. My whole life Ive struggled with motivation, my parents called me a lazy piece of shit everyday and its true. Everything takes so much mental effort for me and I can barely focus because my mind goes a million miles an hour with intense imagery and nonsensical logic. To slow it down and focus on the world around me, especially the physical world, is a manual effort. The depression just makes it all the worse. I just want to know if anyone might relate and how they may have improved their lives? Ive been feeling so isolated even though I surround myself with people lately, and there are less and less reasons I want to stay around.",

I live in a state filled with idiots refusing to wear a mask because the leader of our country told them Covid is just a political hoax. I am going to be trapped alone in my onebedroom apartment for the rest of this year, and at least part of the next. Im no longer young. I dont have children or close family.

I prefer not to share what, but I usually tell them to quit it, yet theyre always like its a joke or youre so over dramaticbuzz kill. Now I dont ever say anything because now I have the reputation of being the negative Nancy of every social event. I even have a certain family member who pry into my business cause they want to know my secrets. Why isnt boundaries a thing anymore? Sometimes I think to myself I should just blurt out what Ive been through just to have a greater chance of letting them leave me alone, but its scary and personal. I cant even write them in a journal, to my past therapist who I saw for six months, or friends I trust. I hate myself everyday for always keeping things in. Im a coward. I feel trapped in my mind.

It seems like even though Ive told him how bad it feels having someone touching me, he keeps doing it and it is starting to suffocate me. He is always asking why I dont touch him and stopping me to hug me or touch me in some way. This is making me quite irritable as well.

    "This is me finally talking about “it”. I do not have depression, my husband does. He has depression, but we dont use that word. We say dark days and on those days his mood is selfdescribed as blah. He has depression, but we dont talk about it. Its not for lack of trying on my part. I wish he could open up and tell me how hes feeling. I wish he could cry with me and tell me that well get through this as much as I tell him. My husband has depression, but we dont tell anyone about it. Wheres your husband? Is the hardest question to hear sometimes. Why didnt your husband come? He isnt feeling well, I say. We decided he needed to get some rest. We dont talk about it. It is dark. It is a cloud that hangs over our house for weeks. Sometimes, it isnt so bad. We have good days. We even have great months. Beautiful months. But it rears its ugly head and we know. We know because the house feels tight. The rooms when were together feel as though they are squeezing in. It doesnt care that I need to be touched, or that I need to touch my husband. We dont talk about it. But we do fight through. We stand back to back. Sometimes, I have to support both of us with my broken emotions and iron love, and thats okay. I know he realizes all of this, I know because in those good days and great months, Im treated as a queen. We make love and make memories and we shine. We shine so bright that I know when the dark days come, well fight them. He knows he has me somewhere in those dark, cold days, even if he cant see or hear me, he knows Im there. And I know that hes there, too, still the man I love, the hero of my fairytale. The hardest part though, the part that I wish we could change because depression isnt something that can just be fixed, I know this my husband has depression, but we dont talk about it.",

    "Should I kill myself? I am the most uninteresting person and I feel like I am the only one who puts effort into any of my relationships. I actually am in a relationship though, we started dating in april. Its a ldr though, and her timezone is 14 hours ahead. It was pure infatuation at the start, we both felt so confident about the relationship. She had plans to move to the same city as me, we had so much in common. We were both sort of shy and laid back. Though as I got more comfortable my extroverted side came out. I think I smoothered her too much though, I always complimented her and tried to tell her itll be okay and I am eilling to wait for borders to lift to meet her. She liked it so I kept doing it, but I think the repetitiveness, lack of physical touch, and my neediness eventually became unattractive. It became the norm. I was always there for her when she needed to talk, and we kept talking about how we are going to meet as soon as borders go up. It was hard to keep interesting and we didnt know what else to do. Then in the last month, things started getting hard for me at work and in my family, I opened up about insecurities about my mom health as she was diagnosed with cancer, and how I feel I have to work on my confidence. I think this must have really been a turn off. She has become more and more distant this past month. She still says shes into me but she doesnt talk about the future as much and is not nearly as affectionate as before. She has said she doesnt know how much longer she can do ldr, but shes willing to keep trying a little longer for me. But it feels like she isnt putting any effort and idk, the relationship doesnt feel secure and loving anymore. I talked to her about it and she said she really likes me, but she feels so distant. Idk what I can do to help this or if theres anything. I really like her, like we never fought, and we really matched. I loved gsming with her, or playing piano for her.",

With gifts, food, and a selfmade depression journal see my other post. And i cant wait to cheer him up with it. I texted him last Thursday if i could bring it. He seemed happy about it and we agreed to meet that evening. But then he texts me last minute saying his best friend is at his place and he forgot they were going to have diner together. He then gave me all kinds of new options, and I then asked if today was okay, but i still didnt get a text back... it has been 3 days I dont know what to do anymore. Should i send him another text? Ugh I am trying to support him but he keeps letting me down every time. He is with his best friend literally every second of the day, it seems like he cant be alone. But he also seems to be unable to text me back? I dont understand. I really dont. I read books, i talked to you guys, and i educated myself about depression, but i am so tired.

    "Do people actually care? Sorry for the title, but it really is the best way to put it. Everyone says they care about me, want me to live, to message them if I ever feel like doing it. But Ive noticed a pattern, those same people talk about me behind my back, those same people often want me alive, but not necessarily around. My question is this, am I right to think that people as a whole are a lot more fake and cold than theyre willing to admit? Because I see a lot of words being said but Ive yet to meet someone who I actually believe cares. This post may seem self centered but I ask it out of frustration, I try my best to fight through it, for others. To be there for others. To care for others. Yet I struggle to find evidence of reciprocation besides empty words. The only reason Im alive today is because I promised I wouldnt hurt those around me by doing it, but Im feeling like they wouldnt actually care?

    "17 year old forced to stop Paxil 20mg cold turkey. Looking for Advice! I was very recently diagnosed with borderline personality disorder as well as anxiety, anxiety related insomnia, and severe depression from the previous improper diagnosis of Bipolar ii, and I was taking Paxil 20mg for 2 months. After my third change of psychiatrist, I was instructed to stop Paxil cold turkey in favor of staring prozac in 2 weeks because of the risks associated with adolescents taking Paxil. He is adamant on me stopping as soon as possible and I do understand why this is important, for the drug is still not FDA approved for treating depression in teens even though it is commonly used for it. I am currently 3 days in, and I am experiencing the full force of the withdrawals Severe headaches and zaps, cold sweats, strange dreams and waking up in sweats, equilibrium and balance issues, tingling of extremities and numbness in hands, lightheadedness, suicidal ideation, dissociation, severe mood swings and racing thoughts. As someone very new to all of this and the processes associated with treatment, Id really appreciate anything, and I mean anything, anyone has to say about their personal experiences with withdrawals from Paxil or any antidepressant for that matter as well as any tips for managing this hell for the next 2 weeks. Thankfully, I am not currently enrolled in high school, so i am not forced to deal with this while stuck in class, but its challenging to go through this seemingly alone without contact from others.

    "I ( 26 female ) have decided to take care of my severely depressed younger brother (20m ) by letting him move in with me last week and need some tips. Hey all ! I am new to the group and a Canadian I would like some advice. This is a VERY long post so bare with me. I took on basically taking care of my severely depressed younger brother. I am 26 and my brother is 20. I have been moved out for 4 years, my brother has been under child protective services from the overly toxic environment at home. For some background mom is an addict  alcoholic  and dad definitely has mental illness and severe emotional disregulation and is severely controlling and overall unhealthy and manipulative  violent outbursts , tantrums, controlling .they are both functional for the most part but very terrible to be around and our entire family became severely dysfunctional as a result and has suffered a lot. In the past I have had reactive depression but am better now here is what I experienced  Basically I can get depressed when sad events happen like breakup death or I would experience severe anxiety when I lived with my parents  to say the least  . I got depressed and severely melancholic  experience debiliating guilt ans selfhatred  and could not function well for months years after certain events happened so I relate to my brother and understand him very well. However, the difference between my brother and I is that I sought help and still speak to someone every 2 weeks.. My brother was always forced into help by CPS for example. He also is a highschool dropout 2x because of the home environment and I know that the social stigma that comes with this has really weighed down on his selfesteem. He is very smart  beat a Canadian chess champion at chess  but he never takes compliments and feels like his depression has altered his ability to retain information  poor memory, brain fog  . He is VERY hard on himself and I almost feel like he would rather stay depressed as a way to selfpunish himself for dropping out of highschool  he even told me he feels like he does not deserve anything good because he is in his own words a  loser .. and feels like he is tired of being alive. Not exactly suicidal in that he does not intent to kill himself but he is fed up of living so could very well do something dangerous if this continues .",
    "My breakup is killing me That was a week ago, the same day she broke up with me in fact, its kind of the reason why we got into the fight responsible for our breakup. After that, I trained every day, thinking itd help me lose weight. But in fact, while I lost 1.5kg within a week, almost half of that was apparently muscle mass. I found out about that yesterday. Now I dont even want to train anymore. In the last few weeks, I found myself repeatedly contemplating passive suicide, as in, it wouldnt be so bad if I drove recklessly and that killed me some day, wouldnt it? Now, I feel like I actually want to die. She had issues, and sometimes those issues really annoyed the hell out of me. But who doesnt have those? I feel stupid for losing her and I feel like I wont ever be able to forgive myself. I was ready to marry this girl, but I lost her, due to my own stupidity. I wont ever find another woman like her again, I know that for certain, and I hate myself for it. I would do anything to get back with her, but she has made it clear that shes not interested in me anymore. Now I know that she will go on tons of tinder dates, kiss other guys, have sex with other guys, maybe in our shared bed and its killing me inside. Is it jealousy? Purely hormonal? I hope it is because if this feeling goes on, I think Im actually going to try something. Im not in therapy, I know I should be, but my depression is making it hard to actually get a therapist. Not to mention that usually youll have to wait a few months until theres a vacant spot. Please help me",

    "Could a vitamin D deficiency be causing depression entirely? Ive been severely depressed and suicidal for well over a year at this point, but Ive noticed that it started easing a bit around MarchApril the start of winter in my country and then worsening again in AugustSeptember the start of summer, while I was actually happy in June and July, and any moments of suicidal ideation were anxiety driven, not depression. In winter, because its cold, I spend most of the day lazing in the sun yes, I know skin cancer, but I dont care, so about 45 hours of consistent sunlight at least. In summer, I stay out of the sun entirely because its too hot and I absolutely hate the heat. So this makes me think that something is particularly bad in summer to make me significantly more depressed than winter. Perhaps thats a vitamin D deficiency. Has that been the case for anyone else?",
    "To everyone who actually took time to read this, thank you for caring for me, a random stranger who probably doesn't deserve getting much help anyways. My mom just got high blood pressure today. And its my fucking fault. Since I dont live with my mom or my dad, I live with my married sister and her family. My parents visit me a few times a year, and recently, my mom was able to come over to Cali since the state she lived in was going to close due to Covid, and she wanted to take advantage of this time and spend more time with me. She comes over, goes into quarantine for 14 days, and everything peachy. Well, when my mom realized I was still hurting myself, she got really concerned, and made it her lifes mission to help me get out of this depression, which I had lied about and said Im fine. Dear Mom, I want to let you know that I really love and appreciate you, but for some reason, I just cant bring myself to tell you. Im sorry. Within the several days, my mom really tried to help me. But I was always bitchy towards her, saying I was fine, and I yelled at her. My mom, she cried sometimes, but she just didnt let me see her doing that. But I could always hear it. And being me, I couldnt swallow down the part of me that hated her, for leaving me and making me grow up faster than all my friends, who had happy families and happy parents, and had the love and emotional support they needed from their own. I was always the one that stuck out, who had to depend on friends instead of my guardians, because they always insisted they were right, and I was wrong. I could never bring myself to talk to the people who supposedly loved me because I always feel like theyre lying, that its their obligation to take care of me, and that they only view me as a waste of space and money and so much time. I got depression around the age of 11, but I just never bothered to get myself help until I was close to really cracking down from all the stress and anger Id hold in from all my encounters with my sister and her husband.",

    "Am I Disabled Enough? So it sounds like a joke but this is a true anxiety. My story without getting into it because its not the point just so you understand where Im from. Warning for all kinds of trauma. I live in Australia and I grew up in an abusive house. Mum would verbally attack my dad and the kids, hed get drunk and beat her in front of us and around and around we go. Mum finally left him for good when I was 8 because my eldest sister turned fourteen and declared she wasnt going back and would keep me and my other sister with her at the halfway house. So mum got a government funded house and took off in search of a good time and a new husband leaving my two older sisters to raise me. they were 14 and 12 to my 8 at the time. Left alone days at a time, my sisters pulled cash in hand work to feed us. My dad got visiting rights so when we went over there we were fed and clothed and he spoilt us rotten especially me but in unhealthy amounts. eventually my sisters stopped going but I loved it because there I could stay up as late as I want never bathe eat myself sick on junk and watch whatever adult tv I wanted. All I had to do was agree mum was a Btch and leave dad alone to do whatever he wanted. meanwhile at mums place she found a miner to latch too with three kids of his own. so now we were six kids between 143 being left alone days at a time and sharing one room. two years later my elder sisters ran away, my father cut contact as it was too much to deal with my mother trying to see me which i learnt to forgive him as an adult but as a kid it hurt and we were in a slightly bigger house. it was me and my step sister in one room, my two step brothers in another and my parents in the last. again, my mother was not present, either sleeping, or out socialising or gambling or in the shed smoking. my dad either worked or joined her. Now I was the caretaker. Needless to say various abuse emotional verbal occasionally physical and by my teens Im pretty messed up. I latch onto my own escape in the form of my high school boyfriend.",

Im pretty sure most of this is anxiety and paranoia, but shes hit me once before and she drinks fairly often Thanks for listening to me b Sorry for taking up your time",
    "I am having newfound thoughts of suicide My feelings have been getting progressively worse. I have had a complete personality change. I was seeing a therapist but dont feel she is a good fit and i couldnt work with their psychiatrist strict appt schedule. Tomorrow I see a free counselor through my work. Lets talk about today. I made a big mistake opening the wrong patients chart and I said some of that patients allergies. This is a HIPPA violation. Now Im being flagged and face being fired over my mistake. I did verify patient info etc but thats not relevant. If I get fired Im fucking done. I find myself imagining slamming my car into a pole or a tree. Im wondering what I will write to my kids in my suicide note. I just feel like dying. These feelings started recently, usually at night when Im in bed alone. Now Im in a busy doctors office, holed away in an empty exam room and trying to to burst in to tears. I fucking hate everything about my life. Nothing ever gets better. Ive turned into a completely different person. Hyper sexual, I made a separate reddit account to post naked selfies and Ive met up with strange men for unprotected sex. Im do filled with rage. I used to think I was spiraling a drain, but thats not true anymore. This isnt all over this one mistake. It seems like everything in my life is one mistake after another. Im in that fucking drain. Im in that drain, and theres no way out but down. I cant pull myself up. Everything else is pushing, pushing, pushing me down and Im drowning. I dont know what to do anymore. I desperately want to end this post by saying I dont want to die! But right now... I dont want to live.",

For a while now I thought that not a lot of things could make me happy, and they didnt, but then I found my girlfriend and things started looking up, but lately everything has got me thinking, what happens when I die? I love my life, I dont want to die, Im so scared that its all going to be nothingness when Im gone, I so badly want to stay optimistic but I cant, my brain just wont let me. I just want there to be a happy ending when I die, but it doesnt seem like thats going to happen",
    "Starting the fight I have been deep in depression and anxiety for a year or so. I am sick of it. I scheduled an appointment with a psychologist for Monday morning. Im ready to fight. Heres the big challenge I feel like I am stuck in mental and emotional quicksand. I feel so much resistance to everything and my brain is super foggy. I also lack motivation.

    "Severe anxiety and depression Most of my life I have suffered with depression, anxiety, self deprecating thoughts and worse case scenario imagery in my head almost nonstop. Its like a movie that never stops playing. I currently take 120 mg daily of CBD spread throughout to help manage my symptoms. Is there any hope for me to be alright without taking so much medication. To put it in imagery, It really feels like its a python constantly wrapped around my neck and When I take medication, I feel it let go for a while but can also still feel it just sitting there in the corner waiting for it it wear off so it can pounce right back on and keep strangling me. I need a long term solution. it has gotten so bad that I cant stop taking the CBD for more than a day without experiencing severe mental distress. Sometimes I cannot even function without it. When I took CBD for the first time it was also the first time I had ever felt normal. I am grateful to have this medication but at the same time I do not want to have to depend on this for the rest of my life. I just want the normal brain chemistry that other people seem to take for granted. Having a normal day for me is so rare its like finding buried treasure for me. And then I want to stay normal so bad and hold on to that good feeling that ironically, I bring the anxiety back about trying to stay feeling normal. It almost feels hopeless. Is there any hope that I can ever have a normally functioning mind without taking large amounts of medication? At this point my liver just has to take the hit because for my mind to feel the way it does without it I cant keep going like that.",

Ive been having thoughts that I feel like i cant control  not all the time but a lot. When it happens i feel out of control and like I cant stop thinking. Normally those thoughts are desperate or self loathing and sometimes its suicidal not active. I feel like someone is injecting thoughts into me and that Im just kinda there as those thoughts are happening unable to stop it. Ive also been having weird dazes where I feel like Im just doing everything on autopilot. I dont really know how to describe it honestly except sometimes I feel like Im thinking nothing at all, or sometimes it goes hand in hand with those racing thoughts. A couple of times when this happened at college I would be walking around campus but didnt feel like I was really there. I dont know whats going on but I feel very out of control and im worried.

    "I’m drowning and I don’t know what to do Sometimes I think that maybe I dont really know what I want. I hate it. I hate how I look at other people and hate them. I hate when they smile, I hate when they laugh I hate how fucking happy everyone else is. Im being left behind. I know I am, everyone is so far ahead of me and Im drowning in my own damn mind. I cant keep this up. I cant keep smiling and pretending Im cool with being the lonely asshole who stays in her room all day. Who only goes outside to go to class or to get some unhealthy shit that shell feel bad about ten minutes later. I dont think I want to die. I just... I want to be free. But maybe freedom is death for me. I want to hit something. I want to yell and scream but at the same time I just want someone to hug me and tell me that its okay and that I matter. But that wont happen. Not in a way thats genuine and real, its all fucking pretend to make people feel better and act like they actually care for the small lonely bitch who tries too hard to not care at all. If Im alone then maybe its better for me to leave anyway, fully embrace it instead of begging for some kind of helping hand. No one would really care if I go. I give them three months tops until I just become a distant name they remember every so often. Everything is so loud but painfully silent at the same time why cant it stop I want everything to just fucking stop. I tried to get help last year but they just pretended to care about me to. They read straight off a damn script. Didnt take long for me to figure out the pattern and say what I needed to get out. I dont know what to do anymore. I feel like this my final chance to ask for help before I go back into a hole I may not be able to escape from again. I dont trust anyone and those few that I do hole a level of trust for I dont want to burden them so I smile and play it off as some edgy joke.",
    "Eating. (Tw) I can barely eat 2 meals a day anymore. Today I had nothing for breakfast, a cookie for lunch and a few slices of pizza and a few chips for dinner. My family keep putting food infront of me but I always say Im not hungry. I cant tell Im loosing weight but apparently my family can. I cant help it. I exercise for hours a day and eat little food. I feel like fainting alot of the time. But I dont want people to find out I havent been eating so I eat tiny amounts, and then continue on. I drink tea to get me through the day. Im constantly tired, cold and angry all the time. I dont know whats happening to me. A few months ago I would look at people who said they mentally couldnt eat and say they were stupid, but now Im the person I called stupid. I guess it started when I found out I was transgender. I started working out because I hated my body. As time went on, I started to work out more. And as more time went on I started to eat less and less. Help me. I cant stand it. But I cant stop.

I started taking Lexapro 5 weeks ago at 5mgday for situational or reactionary depression which isnt a major clinical depression according to my doctor. I had the initial side effects as predicted like sleepiness and vivid dreams, etc. which resolved in a couple of weeks as well as all the negative feelings and dark moods of loneliness etc. plus the anxiety and feeling overwhelmed which have mostly gone, however Ive been feeling extremely unmotivated and low that Im barely making it to work and the rest of the time Im in bed. My sleep was also quite bad feeling unrested in the mornings. Normally I drink one coffee and one tea a day but recently Ive been taking triple shot espressos and Im not feeling any difference. My sugar and carb consumption has also increased. Last Monday when I had my follow up with the doctor he decided to increase the dose to 10mgday. Ive been on 10mgday for almost a week now and probably my sleep quality has improved a little bit but still very very unmotivated and low. Im going through upsetting phases with my family which doesnt help and while I had managed to keep my life under control for a while, things have got out of hand again and my room is a total mess.

    "How do you heal from the trauma of being unloved and emotionally neglected by your parents? Hello everyone, so Ive been depressed and lonely for a more or less long time. I fought a lot with loneliness especially, because its an issue I keep coming back to, even if I manage to tend to my various other issues well enough. Its the loneliness that dwells on me the most. I attempted to deal with my loneliness by trying to make friends and specifically by trying to find a romantic partner. I know what selflove is about and I know the premise behind it, which is to be able to be okay with not having anyone, because youre supposed to fill your life with your own love. But here is where I keep running into an issue No matter how much effort Id put into this, it would never be enough. There is no such thing as a void in my heart which everyone seems to talk about. I would say my heart feels pretty intact, actually. Im pretty fine with who I am. And Im told this is enough, because you cant possibly achieve a state where you genuinely love yourself, unless youre narcissistic. You can like yourself and enjoy your company, yes. And I do believe this is where Im at right now. And yet, Im still looking for someone else. An intimate companionship. A certain sense of belonging. And this is when it suddenly dawned on me Those are the things my parents could never give me. What do I do about this? How can one heal from this trauma?",

Long story short, Im a twice divorced single father to a 3 year old boy and Im a Staff Sergeant in the AirForce which Ive served the past 10 years. Ive been battling depression my entire career. Mostly due to trama of a neglectful and abusive childhood and made worse by divorces that followed. Ive been in and out of therapy for years. Now I am dating a wonderful woman who now live with me and mothers my son like hes her own. She also has a 5 year old daughter and when we first got together she was 2 months pregnant and we now have a beautiful new daughter.

One of the biggest issues that its bringing is its completely destroyed my sex drive and I just dont have the urge for it in any form. So this is causing my girlfriend to feel very rejected even though she know why Im simple not interested in it.

    "Should I kill myself? I am the most uninteresting person and I feel like I am the only one who puts effort into any of my relationships. My other 2 friends ended up dating and stopped talking to most people becsuse of that. At the start of 2020 after the breakup, I started getting into philosophy actually and began focusing on including stoicism and other ways of being into my life. Just accepting that things go wrong but thats okay. Its very hard and I obviously have yet to achieve it but I wanted to learn to be happy even if I didnt have everything I want. I began journaling what I did and didnt like about myself and tried to become a better person. This awkard phase went on for a while, I would talk to my cousin for comfort. We would call and game, though honestly, I lost interests in games. I started craving to play the piano again and by 2021 I decided to get back into it. I practice a lot and can play a couple chopin pieces, but I still am not very good so its not something I can like show off to people. Also I became incredibly more awkward, in trying to better myself, I became super apologetic and passive. I struggle to joke around because I dont want to offend, or I just feel awkward. I never know what to say, and I am always trying to think like is this what a good person does. Which inches closer to today. I struggle so hard with making friends, I dont have much interesting skills. I dont have much hobbies besides piano, business, and like history. I am not super funny. I am awkwrd and uncomfortable with new people. I am needy. I am dependent on social interaction yet I get none. I am not as good looking as I once was. I feel so unattractive. Like why would anyone want to be friends with me, and no matter how hard I try to get out there or be interesting, it seems I am always the one putting all of the effort to relationships. I am the one chasing, and no one is giving me any thought. I actually am in a relationship though, we started dating in april.",
    "I have frightening intrusive thoughts I 21F have frequent intrusive thoughts and im trying to figure out what the hell is going on. I also posted this in anxiety but this may be a more relevant spot to discuss until i see my therapist in a couple of days. I mentioned it to my therapist and weve only met 3 times so its not really something weve been able to talk about all that much yet, since i have much more pressing issues relating to my depression and needing to discuss my past. My intrusive thoughts are violent. When i get in my head as we all do, i go through memories or my pretendscenarios that i also have playing in my head. If its something im anxious about or i dont like it, or just dont know what to do, i immediately have a graphic imagethought of me killing or seriously injuring myself. These images are usually of me stabbing myself in the heart with a dagger, banging my head against a walltable to find that a knife was there cut to me stuck hanging on the wall by my head, me hurling myself off a bridge, my fingernails being ripped off, me in a boat or plane propeller, turning my car immediately on the freeway... This kind of stuff. Some times Ill randomly have one of me being raped. Specific thoughts i have that trigger this shit is a conversation i want to have about something serious, but i get angry and cant handle it so i slam my head against a knife a memory of a cringey conversation from the past why did i say that?! slams head against knife memory of a bad boyfriend did a bad thing and i handled the situation terribly etc I dont know if im alone in this, I just want to know, and then if you were able to stop them, then how did you do it?

Im living with my abusive parents who constantly remind me of how shitty I am, college is a nogo because of my finances and performance in high school, and I dont really have an outlet to find friends.

    "At 43 (M), depression is new to me and I don't know how to handle it. Im a married man, to a wonderful woman. We love each other tons and consider each other our best friend. We recently made a huge move across the country and for the first couple of years, my wife was so unhappy. Despite having a couple of college friends in the area, as well as some of her family, she missed her parents, her job sucked, she just was miserable. And this made me miserable, because the move was mostly my idea as jobs for me are more plentiful where we are. But weve always had evenings and weekends and love our time together. We go on day trips, check out restaurants, everything together. Then we both got new jobs and the world changed. Suddenly, I was working from home and have been since early March, 2020, while she continues to go into work in healthcare. Her new job is mentally stressful, but really great for her. Shes making friends with the women she works with, which would make me SO HAPPY... except now Im the odd man out. My day is make us breakfast, make her lunch, take her to work, come home and work from home, go pick her up from work, make dinner, do the dishes, etc. Of COURSE she helps around the house. Laundry, cat boxes, taking out trash, etc. Im not mentioning my chores to show an imbalance, just a monotony. A few weeks ago her work friends planned a gettogether after work. She mentioned that I should come by when they were almost done with dinner so I could grab a few drinks with everyone. I parked the car and texted her that I was nearby. She said, uh oh. I dont think they wanted husbandsboyfriends here. So I drove all the way back home and realized something. Im lonely and depressed. I knew I was down about working from home. Im a very outgoing person and need human interaction and its been soulcrushing. But once my wife had something with friends that didnt involve me, I realized that I have nothing but her.",

Sometimes they are themselves but sometimes they are not when they let the depression take over. So should we trust or how much should we trust things that a depressed person talked about their feelings? Will they change their mindfeelings from time to time?

    "My breakup is killing me Sorry about the melodramatic title, but this really is what it feels like. Ill try to keep this story short, however I could keep on talking for hours and if someone one this sub was willing to have a talk with me by PMs Id love to because Im just so incredibly lonely right now. About a week ago my girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me. It was a stupid breakup and I feel like my behaviour is the reason for why we broke up, even though she too made plenty of mistakes. When I lost her I once again realized how much she meant to me and that I didnt want to lose her at any costs so I tried to get her back. But all I got were meanspirited messages saying how she doesnt miss me, shes realized were incompatible and that shes glad I moved out. Some days ago I created a tinder profile because I thought itd help me get over her. Guess what, first evening on tinder I saw her profile. And it fucking killed me inside. The next days, she would routinely put some nice clothes on and leave, while I was stuck in the living room watching her leave to some tinder gate, and it killed me. Thats when I realized I had to leave.. so while she was at work I packed up all my stuff and left, leaving her one last voice message that I cant take the situation and that I still want her back. Thats when I got her meanspirited message. I feel like she was all I had. People I talk to are telling me to distract myself with things that are fun to me, but frankly, I dont know whats fun to me anymore. Watching tv shows? Gaming? Playing the guitar? I feel like watching shows and gaming are just occupational therapy to me. I used to love playing the guitar, at least I think so, but nowadays I feel so fucking bad whenever I play that its hard to call it fun either. Sports? Ive gained some weight so I decided I wanted to lose 10kg. That was a week ago, the same day she broke up with me in fact, its kind of the reason why we got into the fight responsible for our breakup.",

I can act all extroverted and social if the situation demands it. I come from a broken home with divorces, drugalcoholverbal and physical abuse. But I still consider my childhood to have been good. I had friends, I had fun. I just dont want to live. I see no point in me continuing doing so other than to not mess up the lives of my friends and family or mostly my gf and my grandma, dont care too much about the others. I have a very detailed and thought out plan of how I would end my life, with small chances of failure. I know its not the right thing to do, but it would just feel sooo good not to feel like a useless piece of shit who cares about no one. Who sees no future or no reason in moving on. Who gets hung up on all his failures and shortcomings. Tried several different antidepressants in increasing doses over the course of 3 years. Only gave me side effects o I quit out of spite. Seen numerous doctors, psychiatrists and therapists. Only felt mocked and not taken seriously so I quit out of spite. Been admitted to the psychiatric ward sry, google translate, a good place to get depressed by the way, but I talked my way out of there after a week. Ive tried quitting my job. Quitting my band. Quitting my girlfriend. Exercising. Eating heathier.",
    "am i depressed or just overthinking? im 15, and it all started 3 years ago, back then o used to live with my dad with my step mum and my half brothers and my mum as well, but my dad would tread me badly. he abused me physically, emotionally, and sexually. but i dont want to go deeper into those parts. everyday after school he would always get mad at me for not studying i mean i did get pretty wacky grades back then but still, how could i stay motivated if even my own father brings me down? he would hit me if i get the wrong answers and say bad stuff. i remember this one time when we had dinner, my step mum was there and we were all eating in silence, i could remember that day like it was yesterday. he asked me if i did my homework and i just didnt answer, he then started yelling at me and he told that i dont deserve anything good in this world. i didnt know what to do that time, i sat there crying in the dinner table while my step mum looked at me with pity. she couldnt do anything and thats alright, i understood why. after dinner i ran to my room and i started cutting that day. after a few months my mum, brother, and i went back to my mums home country, i thought everything would be fine by then but i was wrong, 2 years ago i had no friends. i was lonely as heck. i have nobody to talk to. nobody to vent out to. last year i got some friends, but they werent the friends i really wanted. they kind of treated me like shit. and my aunt always gets mad at me for no reason, she tells me to go back to my father and it triggers me every time. she doesnt know what he did, and maybe if she did, will she change? a few days ago i had a huge fight with her. i cried and told her how i felt with the way she was treating me. but she didnt care.",
    "I hate myself, i need an outside perspective. I feel like a complete failure at everything i do. Everyone in my life says im so talented or that im smart or have potential but every time i hear someone say that it makes me want to shoot myself in the fucking face. Whenever i hear these things my ego just gets bigger and it gives me a reason to think  Maby im not so bad which i then immediately disprove by doing some other stupid shit, i cant get get relationships right, im pretty sure my girlfriend is slowly loosing interest in me, and i dont blame her, i would too. Im not good at sex and fail to pleasure my partner, im terrible at work and am constantly overshadowed by new employees despite my seniority, im failing all my classes at school and i havnt spoken to my friends at all recently due to a lack of motivation. I feel like im looking in on the world from outside a glass door, and i hate it, i hate myself, i hate every decision that i make, will make, or have made, and i wish nothing but the worst upon myself. Im at a point where i do all of these things and feel no remorse, i feel no sadness, im just an empty sad excuse for a man looking for my next momentary shot of dopamine to keep me from loosing my mind and realizing what a piece of shit i am. Thanks for your time.",
    "does anyone else only have bad days? most depressed people have ups and downs, good days and bad days. I only have downs and bad days. I havent experienced any periods where I felt normal or okay in at least 2 years. before that I was severely depressed too but Id still have some good days every now and then. but now Im never at peace, I never enjoy anything, I never feel well. is anyone else unlucky enough to feel suicidal all day every day or am I just not meant for this world anymore?? maybe it really is my time to go",
    "Does anyone else feel like the saturation in their life is turned down? The best way I can describe how I feel is feeling as if someone has turned down the saturation in my life. I can feel emotions. When Im with friends and family or watch a funny video I laugh and smile, but it just feels empty? Lifeless? Like on a scale of 110 10 being the happiest I know I should be feeling a 10 and in general the situation is a 10 but for some reason I cant seem to get past a 5 at most. Its like my brain is saying this is funny you should laugh and feel happy but I just dont feel that? At least not fully. Its like my 5 is other peoples 10s, both are fully happy just one is less than the other. When other people are laughing so much theyre in tears and cant catch their breath Im only chuckling, even though I know the situation is funny. I cant even remember a time where I laughed so much I was in tears. When I laugh it almost feels like a chore or an automatic response that I could just as easily not do. This is hard to explain but when I laugh and smile its like im not physically feeling it. What I imagine true happiness to feel like is a warmness, something you can physically feel in your body, but when I smilelaugh the outside physically changes but inside I dont feel anything. It almost feels as if Im acting but Im not because I do know the situation is funny. Its like theres a disconnect somewhere. Its hard to explain. And this is just one emotion, I feel this with everything. The only emotions I seem to be able to feel the strongest are annoyanceanger and sadness, but even thats toned down, not saturated, lifeless.",
    "Let's be realistic I stand at the gateway between being stuck in my head and living in reality. You could imagine it like an arched doorway, about 12 feet tall. The door itself is made of rocks, placed almost like bars. The support frame is metal, cold, blue. On the inside, behind the door, its cold, its empty, its black. Filled with images if the past, things that I regret, pain, scars. There are two chains on the floor, not far from where I stand. Those chains were what I used to rattle to summon or conjure back the moments I feel I missed. Like opportunities that had passed me by, like love lost by the way side, like all the memories I just cant seem to let go, like all the people Ive lost along this road. But on the other side there is a light thats beaming bright. I can feel the warmth of the air brush my sides and I feel the urge to come running. Like its calling out my name, like I no longer need to be ashamed of who I am today, like everything Ive ever known has a chance to change. But my biggest struggle is in letting go. My biggest fear of losing control, yet I just need to find my way home, I dont want to be trapped here forever, inside the cold, growing abyss. Reminiscing all the opportunities I missed. I dont want to die here alone, yet Im so afraid to move forward, as I navigate this dark night of the soul. Sometimes its hard enough just to breathe, as I feel the light taking over me. All the damage hidden underneath brought to life, im forced to see and the well behind my eyes, it opens up, it opens wide. I can feel the tears stuck behind of all the pain Ive forced myself to hide. So I speak to you in riddles, could it be Im just a boy inside? I know Im stuck here in the middle, too afraid to step into the light.",

    "I got cheated on by my now ex-boyfriend of six years and I feel worthless He said he hadnt loved me for a while. That when he said he wanted to get married that it was just a lie. Through all this I couldnt get him to see that he had lied and cheated. We argued the rest of the way home. At the exit to his apartment I made a comment of how if he cared for the person he was talking to he wouldnt have been a liar. That triggered him. He went into a screaming rage in my face while I was driving on the highway. It was verbal abuse. I feared for my safety in that moment and so I pushed him back. That made him even more enraged and put our lives in danger by grabbing a hold of my steering wheel and attempting to swerve us off the road. I ended up dropping him off at his apartment a few minutes after that and asked for my things back. Since I still had the girl on Snapchat I watched as how he had already rebounded not even after dropping him off. And so now Im just here. Feeling worthless. I cared for him I loved him. But I didnt even recognize him anymore and all I ever wanted to do was help him feel better. He didnt even have a regard for me anymore. He didnt even have the guts to tell me straight forward that he was breaking up with me and masked it with the excuse of needing space. And so Ive been writing this since 523 AM and now its 629 AM. I dont know how to feel. But I feel worthless.",
    "I feel constantly lonely and as though I’m hated by everyone Ive been feeling this way since I started year 7 and it has been constantly eating at me. I always have a persistent feeling that my friends arent actually there because they like me but rather because they feel bad for me or pity me. I havent ever gotten properly close to girls in fear they will hurt me which is a fear that derived from my past experiences with my stepmum and my real mum. And even if people assure me they care and are there for me, I always feel like they secretly hate me and theyre planning to hurt me or theyre talking about me behind my back. I usually just sit on my bed and cry about these problems and have been having many thoughts that the world would be better without me. I managed to tell my dad I felt worthless but his response was thats normal at your age and youll feel better soon, just speak to people but I cant bring myself to speak to people out of fear of them hating me or me inconveniencing them. Im really unsure of what I can do, and I feel lost, and all these feelings and emotions have only strengthened since lockdown started as I havent spoken to people much and have been alone all the time. And a experience that only strengthened this feeling of loneliness was last night when I was in a call with my friends but they ignored me every time I spoke and I think they forgot I was even there. Im sorry if this is kinda weird or sounds like a rant or if it doesnt make sense, Im just trying to type it up but my head is being weird and my thoughts are fuzzy and I just feel so tired",
    "giving up Ive been depressed since 2013 and I feel like Im ungrateful because of it. I feel like Im hurting my mom. Im almost 20 and I lost all my youth on it. My dad left when I was 5 and I started to get really sad but depression just came out when I became a teenager. Im doing therapy and it makes me feel better sometimes, Im taking pills too, but I still hate myself, I hate everything I do, everything I am and it kills me to think Im hurting my mom and my grandmas. Every month my psychiatrist tells me Ill have to take more antidepressants because Im not getting better. A few weeks ago she told me I have a bordeline historic besides depression and anxiety, and I hate that my mom is paying for all my pills and my treatment while Im planning to kill myself. I know she wouldnt be happy if I was dead, but Im struggling, Im too tired now, after almost seven years. I tried to kill myself once last month with sleeping pills, but my family took me to emergency. I saw my mother crying and I couldnt do much more than hating myself violently. Im thinking a lot about trying again. I dont know what to do, I feel like my mind is trying to drag me to hell. Well, I dont have no one to talk about it anymore, so Im sorry for this sad shit.",

My cousin was trying to pinch my sister on her arm and she was wearing a hoodie, and he said let me see your cuts and they both laughed. That surprised me because they know I cut, why would they joke about that. I was angry and sad but my cousin thought I was upset that my brother had a bithday and teased me, and I just fell apart. I was crying for minutes before they even realized. I dont like going to my aunts house because they make me sad.

    "A bit of a strange case: Exercise has DESTROYED my mental health. Thoughts? Advice? I feel like Im a prisoner in Guantanamo Bay, and frankly, Im surprised that more people havent killed themselves in that godforsaken place. I know, it sounds insane, but this is how I feel. Its gotten to the point where recently, Ive had anxiety attacks and suicidal thoughts. I dont want to live like this, I cant live like this. How come there are so many people who do intense workouts and dont experience these afflictions? Exercise is supposed to improve ones life, and indeed, thats exactly why I started exercising, but its having the OPPOSITE effect on me right now. I know that you guys will tell me to see a therapist or specialist of some sort, and trust me, I will be meeting with one soon, but in the shortterm, any advicehelp would be greatly appreciated. Thank you, and I hope that you are all having a good day and enjoying your life.",
    "I don't know how to deal with this anymore. Since I could remember Ive always been off emotionally, Ive tried therapy, and medications it never helped. I should probably give context but, I am just lonely to the point where I feel like nobody gives a shit if Im alive or dead, even though I know I have people that care. I get really kind of crazy if you will, when Im having a depressive episode. When it gets really bad I isolate myself from everyone around me, and it usually helps calm me down if Im getting to manic. This would work when I had school and saw people, I was able to sort of have a connection to the outside world, then Id go home and not talk to anyone and just listen to music and exist. Now that we have a selfquatantine all day Im just alone, and when I have these episodes I have no one to turn to. Even to my closest friends I feel like a burden, and I dont want them to worry, Im aware at how cliche I am. The last few days have been really hard, and I just dont know how much of this I can take while being alone. I just feel very panicky, alone, empty and depressed, and usually my episodes dont last several days, but this one is, and I dont know how to deal with it now. My only coping mechanism doesnt work anymore since I cant go to school then isolate myself. And its getting awfully painful just being me, and living like this. I know and hope itll be better soon, but right now things look awfully grim and I dont know what to do about any of yhis. I dont know what Im expecting from posting this, Im just hoping maybe writing it out could help somehow.",
    "I got kicked out of my house six months ago, and the only thing keeping me alive is fear, work, and my boyfriend. For context Im 20, F, and very new to Reddit I got kicked out of my house in late September, about a week after I graduated cosmetology school, due to an argument I got into with my step dad that resulted in him screaming, threatening, and punching the wall behind me. After two weeks of couch surfing, I bought a plane ticket to California from Texas with the last of my money, and moved into my best friends families home. Its been six months now and I constantly feel like I should just give up. I got a retail job at a company I had previously worked for within about two weeks of me moving, and other than that I havent done much else. I dont have a car, I havent looked into going back to school or pursuing any kind of education, Ive had a couple of falling outs now with the friends who encouraged me to move here best friend who Im living with included, and my relationship with my family has never been more toxic. The only thing that is holding me together is this job, my boyfriend whos been doing his best through out all of this, and being too cowardly to commit to killing myself.

    "What is wrong with me This is a very long post and Im sorry for that. I just hope someone reads it and gives me their honest opinion. I also hope this is the right place for it, if not then, Ill keep this to myself. Thank you all. Hi, Im a nurse student in Germany and Im currently trying to learn for my exam thats in about a month, while trying to find a job at a hospital. not always, but a lot of the elderly I work with call me the nice sister Im not an examined nurse yet, and I also dont compare myself with one, but elderly call almost every female worker a sister. I didnt quiet leave a good impression at every unit i worked at, some told me that I should work on my structure, some told me that I need to smile more because my face always looks angry, and some told me that I should apply for a job at their unit because they thought I was good. I did apply, wasnt really confident that Im good at all but i tried my best to seem confident, because I figured that no one would want to hire someone thats not confident. I applied to meet someone thats known to be very nice and that would talk to students for at least 10 minutes and then offer them a job, but I was unlucky enough to have a meeting with someone else, Mrs. D. My meeting didnt go that well, she asked me a lot of trick questions and lasted for over 45 minutes, she also asked the why should we hire you and not someone else question 4 times because she didnt like my answer, come to think of it, I dont think I answered the question at all and talked instead about what this job meant for me. at the end she told me shed talk to my teacher and the units Ive been at, and give me a call soon. fast forward one month later, which was yesterday. I was invited to her office midshift. she sat me down at a table 2 meters away from her and said we could take off the face masks. then she offered me a limited contract for 6 months and called it my second chance, proceeded to tell me that the units didnt say good things about me and then told me that Im empathyless and that people arent machines or objects.",

    "Why can't depression ever be gone forever? I got mad. And i couldnt get angry at anyone. I felt like even when i did my best to avoid something it happened again. And i burst crying pretty dramatically.. i felt devastated. I mean i know its a ridiculous way to react but i went from good day to worst day ever for a stupud reason in no time and i couldnt stop laughing for a while. I guess i felt frustrated or idk but i kept muttering stuff and couldnt stop crying. And when i calmed down about half an hour later i was worried i had reacted this way before when i wasnt feeling well but i didnt think id react that way now. I thought everything was fine. Now i just dont know if i really am. The only reason i can think of as the source is that Ill be taking classes again after almost a year now Ive failed my last high school year twice in the past when my depression was really bad and after that and therapy i felt good enough to study again i stopped highschool i chose a different institute i studied for two years and my grades were good for the two years ive been studyingi passed the final exam but half way through the end year project i just gave up. I dont know if i can blame my mental health for it or if i just turned into a self sabotaging person or just that it wasnt what i really wanted to do bur i was driven by the fact that i dont have a choice so i just did it. After that i stayed out of school for about a year doing half time jobs and now i want to try something different again. Im afraid thats the cause but i dont want it to be i just wanna finish what i start this time. This thing is already going on for too long. Im not sure what Im asking you here. But i guess i want an opinion or advice. Im worried i cant tell when Im not ok until symptoms get physical and how am i supposed to deal with that.. what if it affects how i deal with stuff negatively and Ill only be aware of it when its too late.

    "I wish I wasn’t so worried all the time. I wish I was actually brave for once. I wish I didn’t always think about what others think about me. I wish I could let go of the past. But I can’t. For the longest time, Ive had this dream that Ill be a musician. Singing songs and making people happy. Making myself happy. Ive wrote songs before, Ive played many instruments before, Ive spent hours playing around secretly in GarageBand. I took singing lessons for a while. In the 4th grade I was in the 5th grade music class, because apparently I was ahead of my classmates. I played piano, and took up drums for a while. I quit singing lessons last year. The violin is gone now. And every once in a while on some stupid magical moment, I play piano. But I still long for music. Even with drawing, which I put my heart and soul into, I still long for music. Even when sewing, I sing. Even when Im outside, I sing and sing and cry. Because Im so weak. Im weak because I couldnt sing in front of others. Im weak because Im so shy. Im weak because I couldnt even sing properly with my singing teacher. I never let go. Im so mad at myself. I want to let this dream go, but I dont at the same time. Isnt it enough for me? Art, drawing, and sewing? Why do I still cling to music? I cant sing. I sound horrible when Im standing in front of people. My legs shake and I cry. I cant even sing outside anymore, because Im afraid of neighbors hearing. I can only sing with headphones on because even I judge myself. Im my worst enemy. Why do I STILL want to sing? Why do I still find myself singing when I can? Why cant I just let this stupid dream go? This stupid worthless dream. Im going to art school to draw, which Im still bad at. Im not going for music. I want to let go of song.",
    "Depression-Why is every remedy have a placebo effect on me? And why can it never stay longer then a week? Im talking literally any type of treatment for my depression. Some examples Tried Celexa, the following week the depression had lessened cuz i had so much faith in this pill cuz it helped my friend then when it was when it was supposed to start working they say all antidepressants take at least a month to work which was around the time my back to normal depressed me depression came back. Of course they would sometimes up the dose just to see, but it never had the same impact as the first few days did. Tried Ashawagandha amp Holy basil adaptogens amp felt relief of anxiety for a few days, then back to same old GAD self cuz i have faith in natural remedies Tried yoga amp exercise, but hard to keep up with when im too depressed amp anxious amp its freezing out to leave the house . id workout more in my house if the ceilings werent so low amp i had more privacy i hate being watched, yes even if someones in the other room doing their own thing amp not even looking at me Tried eating more healthy not saying i eat unhealthy, felt good for like a meal then nothing, but im such a picky eater its hard to always eat the right stuff Tried Positive affirmations, about 115 times it can give a little relief, but nothing that a deep breath couldnt do Tried deep breathing, helpful to slow down breathing when anxious but extremely hard to remember to do Tried amp still trying therapy, but ive had multiple therapists amp after a bit it just turns into a choreexhausting to continuously bring up like yep, today i get to bring up my depression again amp remind myself of all the bad stuff yet again. idk im feeling quite hopeless. and the most frustrating part is that since im literally thinking my way into something working, like why cant i just do it myself? or like why doesnt it stay? i really dont understand ..",
    "Everyday I move more and more towards ending my life soon I feel like I am trapped and powerless. I am a graduate student and my studies are going down the drain. My teacher just told me that I dont have a big chance of passing a huge course and that I have only one week to do everything. I am already stuck doing another course and that isnt going well too. And I deserve it too cause I have no affinity towards my subject. On top of this I already suffer from depression and Im just sick of the sleepless nights or crying myself to sleep. I just dont wanna exist anymore. I dont want to be a worthless sack of shit and just keep failing over and over. I just want it to be over.

    "I got cheated on by my now ex-boyfriend of six years and I feel worthless First time poster here. On mobile. Ive known this guy since we were in middle school, we started talking during high school, and after a failed attempt at my life I dropped out of college moved back home and we ended up dating. This guy had been my rock for all those years. He experienced with me the pain of having my dad get a stroke, my only uncle on my dads side pass away, being diagnosed with ovarian cancer, having my dads mom pass away, my dad have a second stroke, and finding out my mom had breast cancer and going through chemo. Things werent always perfect. I nagged a lot on things he did because he tend to me reckless and not have a plan. Overall I just wanted things to be better for him. To be prepared and essentially have a backup plan. This year he started going through a rough phase at work, being in a call center and having upset customers he would take it to heart when they would tell him to kill himself. For a very long time I told him to find someone to talk to, to go look for a counselor. He never did and I saw him get worse and worse. I tried being the best support I could for him. It was only fair and obviously I did it because I loved him. On the November 7th he finally spoke to a counselor. I asked how it went and he said it went well. Then on November 9th he asked to speak to me once I arrived home from being out of town. He arrived at my house after work. He begins explaining to me that when he was talking to his counselor he was asked what made him happy and responded with photography. He mentioned that he never thought of us. Which is fair because it had been rocky. He said he didnt love me anymore. He finished what he said and waited for me to reply. I was in shock. I didnt realize just how bad it was. It was like a curve ball was thrown at me. I didnt know because he never opened up to me even when I asked.",
    "I hate who i am, i don't know how to change. Ive been a neet for 2 and a half years, mostly because im somewhat socially retarded, not only am i not good at making small talk or generally talking to people in real life, but i also have no interest in doing so with most of the people that are around me for whatever reason, i also use the fact that i have a heart condition that doesnt allow me to make a lot of physical effort to justify the fact that im a neet but the truth is that im mostly afraid of having to deal with people. ampx200B For the first 18 years of my life my heart condition wasnt that bad or maybe it was and i was just used to it i noticed something was wrong when i started working out and my left arm started hurting one thing led to another and now i cant drink coffee or alcohol or work out anymore, the not being able to work out part made me really depressed since working out usually just made any negative feelings i had go away for some reason, and i was determined to lose weight at the time, now im overweight have skinny arms and i dont look anything like i wish i would. ampx200B Im also not interested in pursuing higher education, i barely passed through high school and i know im just not cut out for it even though my iq is 2 whole points above the standard! ampx200B My parents feed my bad habits probably because they feel some guilt for turning out the way i am they used to scold me for being shy and not doing well in school but they also shit talked me for a lot of small things that i dont really want to remember eventually i started confronting them about it and now they dont really know how to handle me so they just kind leave me to do whatever i want, their generation was very different from mine and i dont blame them for not knowing how to deal with the modern problems i have, i kind of wish theyd threaten to kick me out or something ampx200B Now i mostly spend my time consuming media but recently ive been feeling really bad about wasting my time, if any of you have any advice or can point me to a book on self help or anything like that id appreciate it, also i dont have the money to afford any good therapy.",

Last semester I visited my schools counseling center because I just felt so shitty. My depression comes in waves, so it comes and goes which is partly the way Ive been able to hide it for so long but when Its bad I spend hours just convincing myself to shower or brush my teeth. I feel so unmotivated and unhappy. I finally saw a counselor and explained everything I have been feeling and she suggested that I see a psychiatrist. I really want to because I dont know if I can get through another episode and I feel one coming on soon, but I dont know how to tell my mom that I need to see one. I am still on my parents insurance plan so they will find out regardless. I just dont know how to tell my parents or my friends.

I tried to do the 11 support and there was someone who answered but after I shared, I no longer got a response not sure if they got busy, missed my message, or something else.

    "DAE feel like they don’t really want the future anymore? I had a conversation with my brother recently and he was talking about how im going to be applying for top universities and how I could get business scholarships to help pay for it and secure a job placement if im one of the top performers which I could be, and how I need to consider the amount of debt ill be in from it when I get married, buy a house, get a car, have kids etcetera. I just... dont feel optimistic about my prospects anymore. I dont even care about the debt, I cant see myself ever buying a house and I cant even bring myself to imagine having a so and kids. All I want to do is go to bed and not move from under the covers... I dont know when this even happened. I was at the top of my school for exams, got accepted into one of the best colleges in my country, and im studying hard to get good grades in my subjects as well as maintaining extracurriculars. Everything im doing points towards having a successful future but I dont think I really care anymore.",
    "I don’t know what’s going on They cant understand what Im going through. Before this covid 19 shit, everyday I go to school I just see everyone in their groups talking and smiling. And I dont know, for 3 months I really havent felt like Ive been a part of a group, man. I dont feel like anyone out there is gonna give me the support. The last relationship I was in, I thought I fell in love with her, and she said she loved me too. But I always fought with her. I realize now that it was just me trying to push her away, because I was scared of her leaving, so I tried to push her away subconsciously because I was scared that she would break my heart and so i just wanted to have an excuse to break it off first before she could have a chance to hurt me. And I kept telling her to leave, but she said that she wasnt gonna go anywhere because I was worth it. And slowly I started feeling at ease. But then we broke up. We had a huge fight about her not putting me first, her best friend getting in the way. I said I would choose my dreams over her, but I also said I didnt want to lose her. And then she said I lost her already. And we broke it off. She said that she would stay. She said she would stay and figure it out. But she didnt. I guess she just couldnt take it anymore. Everyone tells me theyre going to be there for me, but when I need them the most they arent there. Its hard for me to trust. Sophomore year, second semester, I lost faith in everyone. My best friends left me. I felt so alone. I hovered around different friend groups but I still felt alone. I was bedridden for a time. I think I buried it deep down , because I dont remember much about that year except how I had the worst season in soccer of my life and that I wanted to die. I didnt see a reason for living, and I hated everyone. And then that summer I got my shit together, started training for soccer,and I thought I healed.",
    "i had to say goodbye to my sweet boy today after finding out yesterday cancer is ravaging his body. the vet said he has never seen anything like what was shown on those scans, that my sweet maximus was a very very sick little boy. the inside of his spleen was supposed to look like peanut butter, but instead it looked like chunky jelly with chunks and lumps he could not identify. his body had developed multiple tumors, which were cancerous. he had gone into tumor lysis crisis meaning that a large amount of the cancer cells that were comtained in these tumors died, and released their cancerous contents into his blood. they were killing his red blood cells and destroying the ability to regenerate any at all. his stomach had bloated 3x its normal size, even though it was just later in the day and yesterday morning it had looked fine. the vet discouraged us from treatment because he didnt see any possible way maximus could recover putting him on treatment would only prolong his suffering and ensure he passed painfully. which is cruelly ironic, as putting him on treatment would keep my suffering at bay. but i have to do right by my boy. hes been through too much and endured more than i can imagine, he was brought into this world in pain and i promised him when i brought him home he would leave it in love. i had to keep that promise. i love him more than it seems like my heart can handle, and making the right decision for him is the absolute utterly wrong decision for me. we got the vet this morning and despite not moving except to lift his head the past few days, he trotted off away from the building. i believe in the deepest place of my heart he knew what we were there for, and he was scared. he wouldnt let me turn him around back toward it, and the most he would take was two steps toward the building and then sit back down. i sat down with him and just sobbed. the thought of not having that big brown baby rips my heart into shreds and pierces my soul. we finally got him inside after i just sat with him and talked to him for about 15 minutes. ive never wanted to simply wait in a waiting room longer, but they called us right back.",

Ive spend years and years trying to build relationships and connections with people I really care about but I now realise that no one, not a single person, cares that much about me.

    "Thought I would share this here Hi, my name is Sebastian and I really dont know how to start this post, maybe because Im afraid to be called whiny or whatever, but the truth is Ive been feeling pretty down recently so I thought I would share what Ive been feelingthinking this past 3 months or so. It is a well known fact that 2020 has been nothing short of horrible, but the reality is that, for me at least , it didnt start that way. Beginning of 2020 was maybe the best Ive ever felt in my life. To provide a little more context, Im 19 rn, but back at January February I was still 18 and about to graduate from high school which I eventually did, with good grades, but heres the issue I graduated from a international German school which educates based on the German system Abitur which in short were some difficult exams that I studied my ass of to pass. Abitur also presented me with the possibility of going abroad for college. All my short life Ive felt kinda pressured to go abroad to study, since my father did it and always talked about how amazing it was, and my school was filled with posters of study in Europemostly Germany its a life changing experience. And so I felt on top of my game and started among at the very top architecture in such places like Madrid,Berlin,Stuttgart,etc but most of all I wanted Barcelona because it felt so perfect on paper, like the best of the best , world wide known, top level technology, state of the art campus, and of course the city itself is an architectural delight arguably the most famous architect , Gaudí is from Barcelona. Looking back now, I was naive and didnt appreciate what I had back home , but I had to prove the ones who bullied and looked down on me back in my school days , that I was better than them, and that was my first of many mistake I went there looking for revenge so to speak. Then everything developed so quickly I had barely any time to think , to my awe I got accepted in BarcelonaTech, I found a nice little bedroom on a student housing that was just beside Campus and I started preparing for my departure , which was going to be mid September bc the University had arranged some introdution activities for new comers. It all seemed perfect, like it was made FOR me.",

This made me realize that every time someone genuinely asks me how I am, I become really sensitive to the point that Im almost crying and turn away.

    "I can’t feel anything, no matter what I do, I can’t feel anything physically or mentally I am a 17 yo male, who comes from an extremely abusive household, and Ive recently noticed that my feelings are almost non existent. I also cant feel any pain, some might think its a gift but its a fucking curse. Im numb to the core and I just want to be normal again. I havent eaten in 3 days because if I try to I throw up. Ive been getting 4 hours of sleep regularly and cant physically sleep longer than that. My father used to beat me and force me to torture rodents with him. I remember one time he made me drown a possum in a garbage can and hack a squirrels limbs off. By the time I was 8 years old I had already known how to disassemble, clean, and reassemble a .38 caliber pistol. My father was a narcissist, and I was his golden child. If I ever did anything wrong I was told I was making our family look bad. Id get a hell of a beating if I even said anything out of line, and my mother was constantly in and out of hospitals from her accidents. I believe my father is a large part of why I am feeling the way I am recently. I noticed I stopped feeling emotion when I had a stroke last March. I wasnt scared, or worried, I was calm, and didnt even feel anything. Even after I had almost lost my ability to play guitar, I wasnt sad or scared. Ever since then, its just gotten worse and worse. My girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me and all I had to say to her was ok. Honestly it was probably best for her, I dont know if I can feel love anymore, so whats the point of trying. I recently noticed I cant physically feel pain when I was trying to fix the shingles on my roof. I missed with the hammer and smacked my hand right on the thumb, but I didnt feel anything. Just to test my theory, I smacked the back of my hand full force. I heard the crunching of bone, but still felt no pain. I dont know whats wrong with me.",
    "maybe someone can acctully give me helpfull advice! So, i suffer form depression nearly 18 years now. I was in therapy and i was a few weeks in a psychiatry.

But over these years it become much harder. I want to do things and its like something is holding me back. Its hart to fight it, i try.

The psychologist who told me to think about somethingelse,... idk i can think about many things at the same time.. even if i try to get ried of these pictures in my head... it takes i while and the dissapear. Until then i sometimes wish i let these toughts become the reality... i dont harm myself so you dont need to worry about this! but i do not want to live with these toughts until i died. i could search for another therapist but i only get disappionted. its hard to find someone. hopfully someone can help me. sry for any bad gramma or spelling mistaks.",
    "Breaking up gave me depression.. and I want to speak my mind.. please be nice. I turned to religion for answers, I have been blessed to receive answers, I know 100 that this is all going to blow over, and the sun will shine on me once more. But sadly, it did not take the pain away. The pain is very real and I was trying to numb it with WHATEVER helps. I did not write this to blame my ex. I have read and searched for answers to know that, this isnt her fault. I shouldnt blame her for making a call that I couldnt make. I couldve walked away when the signs came out, but I didnt. Yes, she caused the initial heartbreak, but I am 100 responsible for the actions I have taken upon myself, and how I treat myself postbreakup. It took months for me to realize this, but it doesnt make things easier. I am still looking for ways to keep moving on with my life and try to be the best version of myself. I see clearly now because the clouds that have clouded my judgment had disappeared. Its somewhat amazing to see how far I have gone, yet scared of whats going to come. I have seen so many things from this depressing perspective, and I am not satisfied with the person I am. No one really knows what drove her away. Nonetheless, I aspire to be a better person in many ways. I aspire to be better in terms of mental health, relationship with God, and my character. This crazy experience in my life has taught me to appreciate loved ones, parents in particular. Only when God takes away someone that I care about, I realize how lucky I am to have loving parents and supportive highschool friends that have kept in touch with me through this tough time. Yes, they can help me, but they can only do so much. I dont revolve around their life because they have their responsibilities and commitments. However, at the end of the day, I know that I am responsible for my happiness and I have to drag myself to the place I want to be.",
    "First-time depression Hi guys, its my first time on reddit. Im getting kinda depressed right now, mostly because of my disappointments. I put all my hopes and efforts into a competition and now that I failed my expectation was expecting a second prize but got a consolation one. More ironically, my boyfriend got a first prize which was kinda unbelievable and unprecedented in my school for the past 10 years. To make matters worse, he is entering university next year. Helping him with his academic profiles and scholarship applications made me really proud of him but concurrently selfpitiful. I feel a little inferior to him and constantly downplay myself without knowing how to stop. Both events struck me profoundly and Im confused as to what to do. I think recently Im suffering from depression since I have been haunted by selfharm and suicidal thoughts. I have yet to try committing suicide but actually harmed myself with a knife. What can I do to become positive? Thanks a lot",
    "19 years old and its pretty obvious there's no reason to go any further To live without being under someone elses rule? Or is that gift only given to animals in nature who dont have to live by human code? Id literally rather be dead or anything else other than human. I just dont know what to do anymore I just live each day so sad and depressed, nothing excites me anymore and I have absolutely no motivation to even try anything anymore. I 100 dont blame drug addicts for their choices in life, smoking weed does help me feel better about myself and the position Im in but at the end of the day all it does is make me feel better about life in that exact moment and does nothing for me in the long run which from my point of view seems completely doomed of being meaningful anyways. Id love to have two children but if they had to go through what Im going through right now then all their pain and depression would be all my fault and this life just isnt something Id want to give to someone else its just not worth it. Im too much of a wimp to just shoot myself but at the same time itd just be so easy, I just hope that some accident happens to me thats quick and painless.

Also everyone in the house is against me , for example when me and my brother fight everyone will help my brother , when i and my mom fight everyone supports my mom because she is always superior from me and the best thing is that sometimes when my older brother fights with my mom they bring me into the topic and start saying things like  he always studies and he will never achieve his dreams  or something like that. And the best part is that i cannot get help , i dont want to speak to my mother and solve the problem , i keep everything inside me.

Since I crave the sweet release of death every waking moment isnt a socially appropriate response I was going to holla at reddit to see if anyone could insoire or advise.",
    "I'm so tired I wanted it to stop, I just wanted this awful string of events to end already, yet whenever I got scared or overwhelmed all I was told was to get through it to summer, but I couldnt. I didnt think I could do it, at this point I was being told it would get better soon for months on end but everything got worse. They said thats just life, theres always something to get in your way but you have to do it regardless, but I couldnt cope with that anymore, I couldnt cope with that awful reality. I just didnt enjoy living anymore, and if its this bad now as only a highschooler I couldnt imagine myself being older, in an actual work environment where the same problems persisted. I wanted it to end so badly, nothing was improving and the foreseeable future looked awful and stressful. I promised myself that if it got this bad again Id ask to see a therapist again, it took a couple weeks. Sometime towards the end of next week I learned that I was also taking the SAT another standardized test infamous for not working in the southeast in about ten days, leaving me with not nearly as much time to prepare as I thought. I broke down completely, preparing for the AP exam took enough out of me alone, but two of them back to back was a death sentence for me. I kept crying over the idea that it got worse again, that whenever I thought I was at rock bottom it just kept going downhill, no mtter what I did I would continue to feel awful about living itself. I laid out a ten day study plan to go through, saying that in ten days it would be over and the better times everyone talked about would finally be here, it hurts to say but I dont think thats happening. I remember the next day where during all of class I lied in bed, not saying a word to the friends I usually talk to all day, it just all felt so hopeless.",
    "I don’t want to be dead, but I don’t want to face the future either. Its not that my future is hopeless. I could be successful, I could live comfortably, if I invested my fucking soul into medical school like it seems I might. But when I think about the next few years of my life, I dont want to handle it. I dont want to live through it. I dont really want anything from my future. When it gets like this, I would rather have nothing. I cant see the value in any of the struggle and the pain and suffering. They say that you can still enjoy life even if it is a struggle, but I cant see that happening. I cant see a payoff to all of it. Especially if it keeps going like it has been. What is there to look forward to?",
    "Depression and Anxiety firing up and causing me to feel like I might have a panic attack. So this may just be the anxiety firing up and causing me to stress and panic. Ive had trouble in the past with lonliness, both my parents have kicked me out Because of me wanting a better job, and Ive had friends in the past all of a sudden drop me or stop talking to me frequently, this left me feeling alone quite alot of the time and causing me to worry about upsetting any friends I do make. I managed to make about 3 friends that I talked to regularly, one of those friends started being really horrible, majority of the time to me and I started to get fed up of it. I called him out on it and this has resulted in me and that guy Call him Ed not being friends, however wed end up in the same rooms chatting on discord because of me being friends with the two other friends, A and B, and Ed joining occasionally. Well recently Ed and B have started chatting more and more often and A and me talking more, however in recent rooms, me and Ed have started arguing because of the way he still tries to treat me, B has recently started acting slightly more like Ed as well, which is causing me concern and ended up with me and B having a small argument earlier today. My anxiety is spiking however because, B is talking less and less to me, and now A has started to disappear a bit more, I worry that I will end up lonely again, without anyone to talk to, as it took me over a year to make these friends after the last group of friends I had all left in one big hit. I bring all this up because the last time I ended up feeling like this and lost everyone I considered a friend, I nearly hurt myself quite badly... And I worry about doing that again.",
    "How to talk to me GP about my depression I have had progressively worsening depression since adter an abortion I had in May 2018. It started out as episodes of sobbing crying a lot and then I started having episodes of obsessiveinstrusive thoughts in December 2018. I started having thoughts of suicide this year. They started as instrusive thoughts and now they bring comfort. I live in a small town, surrounded by other small towns and there arent many options when it comes to mental health. I do have a GP that I really like and trust and my insurance pays for 1 check up a year and that is this Thursday. I want to talk to her about my depression and what I should do. I dont know how to bring it up, I dont talk out loud about myself often at all. I want to just crawl into bed and stay there forever but I know I cant just live my life like this. So what should I say? I think Ill write it down before I go.",
    "Cant get motivated to do anything, even shower Im going through my first very difficult breakup after 12 years of marriage to a man who is my best friend and who knows me and I him better than anyone, hes been my other half for so long, and he was my first relationship ever. I am living with my parents while I try to basically start my life over, on my own, and my depression has almost completely engulfed me. There are a lot of days where I can hardly motivate myself to get dressed, let alone shower or other basic tasks. I try to go outside and at least take a walk but even motivating myself into doing that is like pulling teeth. Ive been thinking of making a couple lists for me to check off each morning so I can at least get a routine down. I need to find a job and start being productive so I start feeling better about myself and my situation.",
    "To everyone who actually took time to read this, thank you for caring for me, a random stranger who probably doesn't deserve getting much help anyways. While I was using my iPad, my brother in law got all in my face and pointed out how I already used my iPad for 4 hours already, so he told my sister to block my iPad so I could stop using it. I got really stressed, and I couldnt vent because I could only text on my iPad and computer which was in the living room, and I didnt want to see their faces. So I resorted to using the back of a scissor blade, and ran it back and forth on my arm with all the scabs, and I scraped off the scabs  23 layers of skin. It wasnt bleeding much, so I just cleaned it and let it dry. Then when my mom called me to go on a family walk, I flat out refused, and I started yelling at her for never understanding me, and how fucked up I always felt, and how tired I was I had cried a few times earlier and I just wanted to never see their faces for the rest of the day. Then my mom saw my arm, and she just left the room. Then around 23 minutes later, I hear my sister freaking out about my mom having a bloody nose. A few moments later, my mom started spitting out blood, and thats when we decided to bring her to the ER. On the return trip from the ER, my sister just glares at me and says how the blood was triggered due to stress, and how we were lucky it was only some blood, since she couldve gotten a stroke. My mom starts trying to explain to me that it wasnt my fault, but she just starts tearing up in the middle of it. Of course, thats the last thing me and my sister want, so we just shut up and try to comfort her before something else happens. Then at home, after I had taken a shower and was trying not to cry as I explained the whole situation to my best friends, my mom just comes out of the room with Vaseline and sash in hand. She starts binding my arm, even though I was the one who caused her to be so sick, and she acted like nothing happened and tried to comfort me as I started shaking.",
    "I am so tired And I want someone to see that. To not think I am vein or naive, instead looking into me. Looking at my pain, my struggles, my scars, my fighting, and be grateful. To hold me and say it was worth it, that I am strong. To let my tears fall, and look me in the eyes and say thank you.",
    "I am a toxic person and I want to not be like this anymore. I am a 27 year old man who has recently come to the conclusion that he is toxic. Heres why. I cannot tell if I do not care about anybody elses feelings other than my own, and I only do things to get something for myself. If Ive fucked up in a relationship or Ive hurt someone I loved, I apologise. Even if I am right, I apologise because my father taught me that is the way to do things in relationships with people. I am always the nice guy in the relationshipsfriendships and Ive started to think that Im just some betamale that shouldve been discarded a long time ago. I have no confidence in my social abilities and I often feel lonely as a result, but then when I am with others I usually feel like a black sheep andor get irritated with the company to the point where I dont want to be around them. I just got a promotion in my job and didnt even smile or think that it was a good thing. My boss even questioned me if I was happy or excited, to which I replied yes straightfaced. I am confident in my abilities in my job and it is not boring or mundane, but I place no value on it because jobs are something we must do in order to survive. Nothing excites me anymore. I have lost passion for everything. And I just wallow about in selfpity, trying not to become distraught through rage or unhappiness. Until recently I was calling up my parents almost every day enraged or crying with despair. I am sick of dragging everyone down with me because of my emotional outrage. Thus, I have made the decision to cut off all contact with everyone I know, family included. My gut feeling is telling me to never speak to anyone ever again because I am so sick of trying. Trying to please everyone, trying to better myself, and trying to do anything. I never take to the internet in search for solutions, but if anyone knows how to change their attitude so that they may continue on the pursuit for happiness, then please, I beg of you, share your wisdom. I dont want to be this person.",
    "My depression has been so bad, no one has tried to contact me for months to check up and it tears me apart I cant even reach out in this kind of situation because again, I shouldnt be demanding people think about me. I just wish my headspace wasnt so messed up. Recently, I anticipated that going back online and mentioning my suicide attempt would cause at least some kind of reaction from these mutuals, but nothing actually did happen. Since then I have completely shut down and cant function when I need to the most exam season, its all just bad timing. But Im more angry at myself because I basically asked for this, and when I didnt get the reaction I wanted I caused my own downfall. I know that Ive caused my own isolation, my depression wants me to push people away so badly, and when I see people not making an effort on their side, people who I felt they would, its just tearing me apart. I really, really just want to disappear. I feel horrible for wanting people to feel guilty, but Im so exhausted of feeling this way and I only want to be bitter and angry at the world.",
    "Tale as old as time: live-at-home, depressed 30 year old with no job. My 20s are gone. Are my best years behind me? Ive been severely anxious and depressed for half of my life. I was diagnosed as bipolar a few years ago since two of the most insane experiences of my life ie hypomanic episodes that led me to do things that have left me traumatized. Ive basically been just existing. Not truly living, but not committed to killing myself. Just an animal that wakes up, eats, and repeats. On the upside, Ive recently committed myself to change. What inspired me to write this was a post I saw on Reddit asking 30 year olds to give advice to people in their 20s. As I start a new and, hopefully, more positive chapter in my life, I realize my 20sthe period that most people hold up to the light and call the most experimental, adventurous, and free time of their livesis gone for me. For me, my 20s was filled with a tremendous amount of fear and sadness. As I enter my 30s, theres more pressure than ever to have accomplished something adult. People are getting married, buying houses, getting promotions, switching careers... I have no idea who I am. My personality has withered away. The weight thats been on my chest is only just lifting, and all that time that others have had to explore and discover themselves is gone from me. Now, its time to put on a tie and plunge myself into the rat race. I feel cheated, behind, and angry. Can anyone relate? How do you think differently? More optimistically? Am I wrong about this?",

    "How do you get over feeling unlovable? Ive always felt just very second place to everyone in my life, but that I can at least rationalize away by saying that theyre at least still friends with me at all. But as far as anyone being romantically interested in me, I just feel so completely unlovable in every way. Like my depression keeps people from wanting me. But Im always someones rebound. Im the person who gets hit up after someone got dumped or if they need something quick or they need a distraction. Someone just did that to me and it just destroys my selfesteem every time. Im not worth putting time or effort into, but Im worth hitting up for nudes every time someone hits a hitch in their actual relationship. Im worth a Hey wanna hook up? But never actually any emotional connection with anyone. How do you cope with just feeling like youre not ever going to get what everyone around you already has?",
    "I suffer from persistent depression and my GF wants to leave me. I 39M suffer from persistent depression. Even as a kid Ive been depressed, bullied and have felt unloved and flawed due to a difficult upbringing and undiagnosed ADHD. I suffered from this well into my adulthood. Feeling broken and flawed. About three years ago I got diagnosed with ADHD and being in a bad situation with work and a bad breakup after a very long relationship led to depression diagnosis. I got CBT and was put on ADHD meds that helped out a bunch with my ADHD. Now on to my current situation and my reason for this post About 2,5 years ago I met this great girl and we hit it of in a long distance relationship. Shes loving, positive and very helpful. She can be short tempered though and has some insecurities. Unfortunately my work situation went from bad to worse and I just couldnt do it anymore. I got help and this led to some more help from a shrink but I was put on hold for almost two years now and I never felt so lonely, sad and depressed. Also the Covid19 pandemic did not help things either. Right now I am seeing another shrink and a psychiatrist that is helping me out with my ADHD meds. At this moment I am so tired and feel like I can not enjoy things anymore. I feel resentful and frustrated. Obviously I am in a bad place and this unfortunately damaged my relationship and my sweet girlfriend. I noticed her pulling away from me, getting frustrated with me and or irritated. At times Ive gotten the silent treatment. Sometimes I acted out in a way that hurt her in stressful situations or moments where I felt like Ive failled. Like forgetting important things, not doing something or being late again and again. She got mad or gave me the silent treatment. My anxiety got the better of me. Offcourse we talked, and that was difficult at times. I felt sad, misunderstood and she made it clear that she felt talking about it was a bad thing. Last night she told me she did not see a future for us in that way.",

    "I feel like my efforts are pointless I started going on daily walks like about a month ago because everyone kept telling me how its some kind of magic solution to my depression. I tried being consistent with going outside a lot of times before but I always found myself stopping after maybe 3 or 4 days. But this time I managed to keep it up for a month and I definitely like its an accomplishment, at least. At first it was hard to get used to but after a week I felt somewhat okay with it and no longer felt like I was forcing myself to do it. But now I just cant help but wonder why Im doing any of it. It doesnt really make me feel any better. Im still the depressed old me. And its not like I lost some weight either. Maybe Im expecting too much within a short time but honestly I still doubt it will do much even in the long run.",
    "I have a friend (she's my cousin but we're very close) who's talking about trying to kill herself and starving herself. Do I go to the guidance counselor? My friend is really struggling right now and is trying not to eat. I found out from a mutual friend a guy shes talking to romantically and she admitted it to me very willingly herself. She showed me their texts and she was talking about doing it because she wants to kill herself so she wont listen to anyone who tells her to get help. Im thinking about going to the guidance counselor because she already expressed that her parents wont schedule her an appointment even though shes asked. Shes diagnosed with depression because shes had one appointment but never got another. I dont want her to be upset with me and shes telling me herself to force her to eat. So I dont know if I should wait it out or go to the counselor.",

Ive done nothing of note, not even watching a movie or going to the grocery store, the only times Ive left my house are for sports practice which I dread and just despise. I think its been a long time coming but in the past few hours Ive felt myself slipping in again to the pot of despair where Im more irritated, testy, emotional and numb, and moody, and overall a pit in my stomach forms that I have to live through. Theyve happened more and more and for longer durations since I began taking meds and therapy. Any advice at all on how to buffer this dread and flare of depression would be greatly appreciated, I can already feel myself sliding into it and just about all advice is appreciated.",
    "Too many losses..so much pain So many losses... Im tired. Hurting. And feel alone. The past 78 months have been hard. Ive experienced a lot of losses and they keep coming. First.. I ended a long term relationship in September. We lived in another state I left and returned to our home state. I left him, our home and my job. Eventually.. I lost my car and cat. All of that was hard. My ego hurt because he reconnected with a former ex shortly after I departed within weeks and they are still together. He still attempts to contact me and in moments of loneliness and weakness I have seen him, despite knowing about his relationship. When I returned to my home state I moved in with my sister. She just informed me that her lease is not being renewed and I have to move in two months. My anxiety is thru the roof as I dont know if Ill be able to get the money to move with such short notice. I am working, but its a seasonal position that ends in June. I am looking for permanent work. Lastly, a close friend died over the weekend. She had cancer was diagnosed in December. She had been a big support to me over the years. We talked daily when I lived out of state and every day since I returned. When she received her cancer diagnosis, I was a big help to her. I feel hurt, lonely and alone. My circle of friends has always been small and it continues to get smaller. Right now I feel like I dont have anyone. Id like to see a therapist, but most dont accept my insurance. Besides that will also expire in May. I also feel hopeless. Im in my 50s so starting all over again feels daunting. Id appreciate any words of encouragement. Thanks",
    "HS ruined my life HS was the start of several problems to my mental health, stress, anxiety, social problems and bad grades with it too as a consequence... Everything started back on the 31st of October of last year when we were having a party in our class because of Halloween, then two bullies entered the classroom, and basically changed my life. There was a bully episode that day, and was the consequence of me changing the section of the class, which means changing classmates and teachers. I made the right choice as I was constantly harrassed by the old classmated and the teachers were bad, like, really bad. So I changed the section, and I thought everything was back to normal. I was wrong. I find it hard to even study now. I cant force myself into doing nothing. Literally nothing. There is nothing I can do even to go to school. Its really fucking hard. I failed my mom. I failed everyone and what I wanted to be. I find myself in the situation where I cry a lot thinking about this. I am a failure. My mom had faith in me. There is still people that love me. My grandparents, my mom, everyone in my family. Except I havent talked about it to any one of them. I think it would be embarrassing because they cant understand what its like to be like this. I expect an answer like youre too young. And they are almost right, except depression can be found at any age. Im having a mental breakdown, seriously. As I said before, I struggle when I want to force myself into doing things, like homework or just study. I just want to end it right now. The only thing that makes me sad about it is what my family will think about. It not gonna be their fault. I even failed them. They were never strict with me, always there to love me. But now everything has changed, Im a disappoint to them even though I dont know it already. They know nothing about my mental state. Its hard guys. Life is hard. And meaningless. The only reason Im still alive is because of my mom and my family.",

Doesnt matter what Im doing, itll just sucker punch me. My mood gets really dark at the snap of a finger. But now its getting harder to actually cope with it and function as a human being. I think its been this way for about a year now. I used to be able to escape it if I was doing something active. Like with friends or whatever. But now it doesnt matter. Itll just fuck me up whenever. Sometimes it can get to the point where Ill have difficulty remembering things or having a conversation, I dont know how to formulate sentences, and it just becomes allconsuming. I dont understand it. My thoughts in this state range from craving substances to escape, thoughts about how nobody likes me and I dont matter to anyone, and sometimes thoughts that I need to hang myself. I want to have a good life but I dont want to live it as me. Im way too hard on myself.

So last night me and one of my buddies, who I am very close to, had a discussion on whats been going on in my head. Lately I have been feeling super sad and borderline suicidal because I have been focusing on my childhood and have come to the realization that I had an abusive childhood. My abuse was mostly psychological and verbal, but it still hurt and I can still feel it to this day. Anyways, last night me and my buddy were discussing how my childhood was abusive and how I try to reach out to others particularly women for comfort, because I feel that I was denied affection by my mother while growing up. All through the conversation, it didnt feel like I was connecting with my friend, only my internal emotions and sorrow. It felt like the mini therapy session we were having was doing little.

    "Should I go live on Reddit? So I have been having trouble connecting with the outside world and it is starting to affect me. My therapist has encouraged me to try to reach out to online communities. I try to, but I mostly just sit on the sideline and watch. I am thinking of going live on here and try to reach out. It would be a big step even if i only get like one or two watchers. I am just scared and need some encouragement I guess. Thank you for reading.",
    "Alone in a new country. Feeling terrible. Im so lonely. I just moved to another country with my boyfriend. Its a non English speaking country and Im feeling so incredibly alone. My boyfriend immediately got a job and hes working long hours, meanwhile Im at home alone just waiting for him to come back. Ive had depression and anxiety for years and years, it was slowly getting better but I still had my rough days from time to time. I feel like a complete failure, and I feel so stupid for hoping that this move would make me feel better. I feel like an imposter and like I dont belong anywhere. I dont deserve to be anywhere or have any chances in life because there are so many better people out there than me. Im so terrified of looking of looking for a job that I just keep putting it off. I have no desirable skills, I cant speak the language. Who in their right mind would employ me? I was honestly doing so well for the first month since I got here, loving the country and just feeling fresh and new. I posted on an expat subreddit for the country Ive moved to on a different account with a question I had, because I honestly had no idea where else to ask it. I tried so hard to phrase the question in the best, clearest, most polite way possible, because I was worried about being a burden. There were a few people who answered my question and were helpful but it got downvoted a lot, because someone reposted my post on a different subreddit made for making fun of people. And the repost got so many upvotes. It had people in the comments calling me retarded, and a fuckwit and stupid and just generally shitting on me. I wish I never posted anything, Im probably going to regret posting this as well. Im so completely crushed. Ive never been bullied this badly before. I dont trust anyone anymore. Ive used this new account to post this because Im so terrified of these people following me around on any different posts I make. I really thought that it was going to be a nice community. I wanted to make friends and get advice from people in the same situation as me.",
    "Just a dumb person who doesn't have anyone A few weeks back I found a little break for a few weeks. Thought it would make me feel a little better but it didnt turn out that way ig. I have time off but no one wants to hang out or spend time with me. I just sit in my room lying and bad memories keep running on and on. I can hardly breathe many times. Just lay there paralyzed no idea whats happening in my head or surroundings. Many things working against me lately in life but theres no one to just help me with those. I dont know how or what to do. I just wanna die for once. I have seen so many rejections now need someone to accept coz its taking a toll on me. I cant sleep even tho I am so tired. The only thing that goes on in my mind mostly is how badly I wanna die. Just everything I thought about how Id like my life to be has completely fallen apart and there is no hope to fix anything. Everytime someone asks how am I doing the only words that come out r I am fine even tho I know I am dying inside. So lost. Just so lost.",

    "I’ve broken a year long streak of not cutting and now I can’t stop (long post I’m sorry) Its just about two months until my eighteenth birthday. Ive been having these terrible thoughts for almost as long as I could remember. It just started out as this awful feeling and its evolved into daily thoughts of suicide, nonexistent self confidence, what can only be described as extreme social anxiety, a constant feeling of loneliness, and self hatred. About two years ago I started cutting. I dont know why i started but i did it for almost a year. It took the pain away emotionally and made it all physical. It became something I could see and touch not just this oppressive darkness I feel on a constant basis. I knew it was an awful habit so I tried my best to stop. About three or four weeks ago things got really bad and I did it again. And now Im back to square one. I dont have anyone to talk to because my parents would send me to a hospital, my friends would stop talking to me, I have no significant other to share my thoughts with because I am completely unlikable and extremely awkward around other people, and my therapist refuses to do anything about anything I tell him. Every time my brain makes things bad I do it again and again and part of me wants to stop because i know its not good but at the same time I really dont want to because in some messed up way it makes things feel better. I feel trapped in my own mind and I dont really know what to do anymore. Thanks.",
    "I can’t go more than 5 minutes without crying These last few weeks have been the hardest in my life. After covid cleared out college campuses and my partner and I were forced to go back home my boyfriends family told him since he was back living under their roof he would have to follow every one of their demands. In the town where we go to college we were seeing each other multiple times a week. And the week before we were booted we spent every hour together. As soon as we got home his family told him he could no longer see me. I understand we are in a pandemic but we had been swapping spit even that same day they told him to quarantine. If he had anything I definitely had it and vice versa. I agreed to two weeks not seeing each other, not knowing how hard it would be. Even after that ended they didnt want us to see each other because during that time my state issued a stay at home order. I have not been able to see friends obviously and my family is abusive and toxic there isnt a single day in the house that there arent screaming matches. I lost my motivation to do any of my classes that went online. I stopped eating, I started drinking, and taking pills in incrementing amounts hoping I would gather the courage to kill myself. I started cutting myself so I could distract myself from the emotional pain. All I do is lie in bed, and get water once a day. I cry so often starting as soon as I wake up, and even more so at night. I havent been able to sleep well, sometimes at all. I only fear this situation is going to get worse and it feels like there will be no end. It was a shock to come from months of being with my person so happy to have it all stripped away so suddenly. If anyone has any tips that would help me, Id appreciate it.",

It got so bad that I had to get outside help which made my teacher even more mad so he started insulting me straight to my face, as well as behind my back, saying he doesnt want anything to do with me and basically disrespect my entire work and from my schoolmates tell me he is quite proud of it, it got to the point where my parent had to go and talk with the school. I wanted to press charges More fun news came when all of our sponsors pulled out before we could sign a contract with them so we got no money ATM so basically Im getting shit at school invested 10x time than anybody in the project as well as the 1500 that I may not get back, also possibly severe lung issues. And now Im on vacation and I feel helpless since I cant get anything done here and I feel like I dont deserve it and that its not the time for RampR when the project is going critical, I also need this because MIT looks at stuff like that, its a very prestigious and demanding STEM contest. And right now I just feel empty, unloved, alone, anxious, stressed and hopeless, I have to be happy or otherwise my family will be mad at me for ruining the holidays which puts even more pressure on me. I had a similar situation already a few years agochoosing a school where I got close to attempting to take my own life, took me 2 years to recover, I made myself a promise that it would not repeat with MIT and now I feel like it might happen and that I will be left with nothing and alone, just an empty shell devoid of happiness and any hope for tomorrow.

    "How to get through depression as a young adult ? Hello... Im new to reddit, and joined this sub because Ive been dealing with depression since the beginning of my teenage years and wanted to ask you guys and especially those who found a way out of depression how did you manage to get through it ? Im only 18, ik im still young and all but I feel so empty and worthless, crying and thinking about killing myself everyday. I dont have any objective to focus on in my life that could help me cheer up and fight for. Of course I spoke with therapists but didnt keep up with the sessions because everytime I talk about my problems and my past I start crying and panicking, which makes me think even more that Im helpless and makes me hate those sessions... Also, I find them useless for therapists say things that are really obvious, like if you want to have friends and go out with them, just ask people of your class to hang with you, well thanks, but the real issue is that I cant find the motivation and courage to talk to people since I always fear to be rejected. Thats for this type of answer I put an end on the sessions. My parents know that theres something off about me but Ive always done my best in hiding how bad I feel because ik they wouldnt understand, since all they do is making jokes about my sad facial expression when I eat with them... And I have literally 0 friends IRL who I could talk to about that, only online buddies that try to cheer me up sometimes, but I can tell that they get tired of it and I cant blame them for it, ik it is hard to try helping someone but things just remain the same. I really want to get out of this situation... Thank you for reading, and sorry for the grammar mistakes, Im french .",

    "Shitty New Years Worst new year ever My ex fiancé decided to added me on snap and make me relive everything until 3 am when I literally just got over a few days ago? Its been 6 months of radio silence, an email from me, calls with no answer. We were raising my son together his he was 5 months old and we heard nothing from him. His excuse was the same one that he used all throughout our relationship to not be there for us work is killing him. He owns a pizza restaurant.. and hes a control freak so he basically does everything himself even though he pays employees then stressed himself out because hes doing everything and working 16 hours a day. It ended with me asking for 1 hour a week of couple counselling because I know I have issues but he does too and needs to be able to make at least one hour a time a week for his family if it was ever going to work. His message was  I miss you. happy New Years and then from there it turned into him going on about his how shitty his life is without me.. even though apparently I was the reason he had no money ever and now its the same. I live off of less than half of his income, supporting my son in a two bedroom as opposed to his one bed and somehow I have savings, even though I do have some bad spending habits  fast food delivery , and grocery delivery because sometimes Im too anxious to leave the house and I need to cook for my son. Anyway so that was a mess. And then my friend with benefit that I was falling for.. that I thought maybe felt the same because he was driving an hour to see me, bringing me starbucks, offering to teach me how to drive and cook better, talking about maybe meeting my kid in the future, talking about taking me out clubbing after covid cause Ive missed out being a young mom with no help had a New Years party.. didnt even think to invite me and posted on his snap grinding with some girl 10x hotter than me.. so I hate myself so much for thinking maybe I was special, maybe I meant something to someone in 2020 nope..",
    "I don't know if I'm depressed,anxious or something else (I couldnt think of a good title) I dont really know where to start, so this post will be all over the place, sorry but I just need to get this off my chest I got out of a two week relationship a while ago, and although it was not seem like much he was one of my best friends and I loved him to the end, but I kept having what I call breakdowns , I tear up,my heart races, I dont want to speak, I distance myself from others, and a couple other things, these were starting to happen more often and I decided that the relationship was putting too much stress on me so I did something that I now regret, breaking up with him For the next day or two he was moping around school, I felt really bad and guilty but I thought it was the best thing to do at the time. A good thing to mention right now is that my stress and other things I couldnt sleep, loss of my appetite, etc... had also stemmed from my home life, but that goes into a whole nother story. On Friday I found out something, that he had already gotten a new girlfriend we broke up on Monday btw with a girl who had a crush on him through, and before, we went out. I know it was stupid of me but I was upset, I was glad for him but I couldnt help feeling...betrayed?? ?very stupid of me I know In short he then told people why i broke up with him, and that is when i started to ignore him as it was private. I keep having these breakdowns and I feel that this story is when it really started to affect me, at this moment I have had 3 breakdowns in lessons and 1 at break, along with many at home. I just want to know if Im being stupid or if I actually have a problem, sorry about my bad writing skills, Im writing this as Im in a breakdown If you would like I will get into my home story, it is a big part of this story Thank you in advance",

    "Meds helped for a short period of time, but now I have no energy again, and can't do things. Any advice? Long story short I was diagnosed a few months ago, but was in denial because I wasnt actually sad about life, suicidal, etc. I started taking SSRIs LexaproEscitalopram and got a taste of what things could be like. For once, I had all the energy I needed. I didnt spend forever in bed or on the couch deliberating when I wanted to do something, took five minutes to just pull myself up. I no longer felt like I was fighting the weight of my entire body to do simple tasks. After 2 weeks I decided to drink, and thats when it went downhill. For 9 days, I was without energy, spent hours on the couch watching TV each day, not getting up to do much besides work. I doubled my dose, then for a few days it got better. Energy was back, I was doing things, etc. But then it went back to normal. To be clear, Im still not depressed in the classical sense of having negativity about life. I have hope for the future, overall Im pretty happy with where I am. However, I miss having the energy I had. I miss being able to actually work towards my goals and not feel exhausted by basic chores. My mind would go on autopilot, and I didnt have to constantly make decisions to preserve energy. Any suggestions on what I should do next? Ive been on Lexapro for 4 weeks, with a small gap last week where I didnt take it for 2 days straight. Im not sure whether I should seek other meds, keep on my current ones, or even look for other factors when it comes to regaining my energy. Im goign to book a doctors appointment and discuss options, but I wanted to know if anyone else had similar issues, and what theyve done.",

The amount of anxiety that situation gives me makes me sick. I want to do it, I want to get my schooling done and graduate but it takes so much to bring me to even have a sliver of confidence to even consider going.

    "First time in forever. Hi. Hope everyone is well. Recently Ive been diagnosed with manic depression disorder and anxiety disorder at the age of 18. I think Ive always known Id be struggling ever since I was about 15. Just a little context, 2020 was a weird year. I started off having the worst manic episode ever to a point where I lost 4 stones, considering i was already skinny. Then i got back on my feet, I was eating healthy and working out and even enjoying the air. Some things happened during that summer that traumatised my brain. It put me in a bad place as I went to college and was not enjoying it at all. Im already seeing a therapist and its helped but it never feels like it majorly helped, it just feels like someone there to talk to. Now im here, with failed relationships in my family, no friends, horrible sleep pattern and constant pain. for the first time I feel hopeless. How do you recommend I get out of this lump and state that I cant even get up to go get my prescription? For the first time in forever I genuinely believe I cant help myself and i feel stuck. What do i do?",
    "How to get brave enough to kill yourself Especially seeing how the world responded to Covid Mostly the US and watching everyone bitch and moan how they cant go out or get haircuts while THOUSDANDS of people are dying is just so fucking disgusting. Humans have outstayed their welcome amp I honestly cant wait for the end of the human race. I have no interest in anything anymore and even if I did, like drawing, I immediately remind myself how pointless it is. Ive been drawing for a good chunk of my life and seeing children so far ahead of me in development and skill just makes me realize how Ive wasted my time on something so trivial. I have no messages or any grand ideas to out into the world. No one wants to see shit from a dumb ass white girl from LA. Well, a dumb ass ugly white girl I love animals but cant take care of them for shit amp I feel like Im always failing them. Humans do nothing but slay and enslave animals and we dont care how many have to go extinct as long as we get fancy things. Im taking up way too much space and resources. I could be happy and free by now sell all my shit and travel the world before kicking the bucket but instead I choose to run the rat race, get that tiny slice of bread and do what every other human does. Im too scared to do it but getting closer I think!! so this is what I deserve. I have shit planned like trustswills and how Id do it but I dont deserve peace. I cant even say really why Im coming to the internet for advice when I know exactly how itll turn out. Get maybe a few replies, mostly being trolls and the rest being a generic itll get better! crap I feel just wrong in this person suit that was not tailor made for me and theres no way of getting out except death. So I guess just any advice on how to better deal with being a worthless loser, how to hold up that smile so you dont make anyone else uncomfortable Or just changing yourself completely and how to ultimately gain confidence to fucking do what Ive wanted since middle school.",
    "My depressed partner drains me tldr My partner has been depressed and not knowing what to do with his life for a long time. I am the only person he relys on for support and I cant bear it any longer. It starts to severely affect my own life quality and happiness. I 30f met my partner 32m at university eight years ago. He was a very fun, open and active guy with a huge social group. After two years of being friends we started dating. It was around that time that he was done with all his courses and papers and the only thing left for him to finish uni was to write his bachelors thesis. That didnt happen for another four years. Within that time he basically didnt do anything. Didnt write his thesis, didnt get a job. He told me, that he had no clue, what he wants to do with his life and I tried to encourage him to just do some internships to figure that out, but he never did. He is fortunate enough that his parents pay for his expenses always did and still do, so money wouldnt be the problem. He never did any internship. Fast forward six years and the situation is still the same. He did eventually finish his bachelors and started a masters degree but realized that studying just isnt for him. However he still isnt properly searching for jobs or internships or general input that would help him figure out, what he wants to do or be. The thing is, that his self esteem is lower than the mariana trench. He feels like he doenst know anything and is underqualified for basically every job. Hes not. Hes incredibly smart, attentive and detail orientated and has a great passion for social justice but he keeps telling himself that he isnt enough for any job and he doenst dare to apply. I dont know how to help him. All my affirmations seem to not penetrate his mindfog. However, the problem is that Im the only one hes talking to. Because he realized that all his peers moved on he stopped having contact with them because he was embarassed. So here is the thing.",

    "This is a cry for help... I spent the next 8 months completely depressed. I can describe my mood like instead of blood, some sort of black ink was being pumped into my vessels. I spent nights crying and punching the wall. I moved to another town for college. Dated 3 more girls but I couldnt love them and I still wanted that specific girl. I dropped out of college and moved back to my hometown to my family to start studying for the big test again and get accepted in a university. How did that happen? 8 months after my breakup, While I was spending my days and nights depressed as fuck, I saw something on Instagram. A girl from my hometown whom I had a crush on for a year followed me on Instagram. I saw her post and stories to know her better, and she was EXACTLY my type. Her taste in music, her beliefs atheist and her style and her face. She was kinda the one. As Persian names are not familiar to you, I refer to her as Jane. And, I refer to myself Jack. I started talking to her on Instagram, and we hit it off. I reached one of my girlfriends who knew her. And asked her if Jane is single. She said she got back together with one of her ex boyfriends, and that guy is a fucking douche. He had convinced Jane that their breakup was her fault and she needed to grew up. Jane is also 19, and the guy was 20. That guy was driving Jane crazy. He disrespected her in every possible way and didnt care. I saw that as a great opportunity that when they breakup again, I can date her and treat her the way she deserved to be treated. So I waited. But the next day, that friend told me that Jane asked her did Jack say anything about me to you? She said no, but told her that a long time ago she heard from one of her friends that Jack is into Jane. She told me that the moment she told that to Jane, Jane got very happy and excited, and told her that she has a crush on me too. I couldnt believe what I heard. I wanted her but she was into me too?",
    "How to help my flatmate who is crying every day? Hello! My good friend and flatmate 23 is crying almost every day in her room since we started to live together 2 months ago. I dont want to ignore that since I like her, cant stand seeing another human suffer and... I study psychology. I am also 23. The difference is that in theory i get the point but in practice I am feeling so helpless to a friend who is getting into depression every day even more. Today I tried helping again by texting on messenger if I can help but she answered that she is useless, bitter and old. I know that her parents are very toxic and dont give her feeling of safety. She also broke up with someone she still loves half year ago, she cant find a new job for a long time now due to pandemia and she quited university again because she felt she does not follow and she does not like it and studying online is not for her. Its a complex situation. Or maybe actually its very simple... I dont know thats why I would be very happy to get from you some advices since I know how reddit community is experienced in such topics. Thank you a lot in advance!",

    "I'm tired of my lack of motivation Hi, first post here, so Idk if the flair is right and if I will be able to put in words my feelings. Anyways, Ill give it a try, so sorry for the long post. Since the beggining of the quarantine I came to live with my boyfriend bc I know if I didnt see him often I would lose my mind and terrible things might happen. My college is trying to transform our courses in online courses, and is mainly succeeding. In the beggining I sort out everything I should do, to not leave everything to the last minute, so in the first weeks I worked like crazy and managed to anticipate the majority of my tasks. This leads me to last week. Last week I confirmed through my professors and schedules that I was ahead of almost everything. I read most of the texts, wrote most essays, made almost everything that I could do. I had almost no day to just relax or do only minor chores. So when I took my bullet journal to schedule last week and this current one, I saw that if I did one task per day I would be free to read my book and be concerned with other things, since college stuff would be done. So I distributed one task for each day untill the end of this week. But I CANT DO THEM! It is driving me crazy because it is only one simple task I must do that day, but I cant find ANY motivation to do them and now theyre accumulating! Im getting mad at myself because its just one stupid task! And I cant do it! And this lack of motivation is affecting other things. I cant wake up early to do my exercises anymore, I cant be happy doing lunch I loved to cook, but now its just an obligation, even my games and my books dont make me happy anymore! Im in a constant state of apathy and I hate this! And now Im concerned that because of this my boyfriend will think that Im just not happy around him bc of him, and thats not the problem at all. Sorry for the long post and thank you in advance for hearing me. I would really appreciate some support words.",
    "Found out my ex moved and is dating again Its been a whole year since we had last talked and I didnt even mean to find out. I was talking to a mutual friend of ours and I asked how she was doing without thinking. The news hit me like a truck, it felt like all the work I put in to slowly stitch my heart back together was for nothing. A week ago I was going about my life, happier than I had been in a long time. Now I cant even concentrate without thinking about her, about what her life has become without me. I know I should keep moving on, she didnt even have the decency to breakup with me in person after 4 years together, but it feels impossible with all the feelings that have come back. What should I do?",

The worst part is going to sleep though. I feel even worse laying in bed at the end of the day. Someone spent about 24 hours with me recently and i am embarrassed to let them see that this is the way I am living. My vague motivations to do something might last a couple of hours or day but nothing ever comes to a worthwhile fruitition. So i spend yet antlother week where all i do is surf the internet and tidy the house. Im really scared because I am so close to giving up and i reallt dont see any of the rewards of making the effort to be worthwhile.

    "Yesterday Was Rough To catch you up Ive dealt with depression, anxiety, and parasuicidal thoughts for over 30 years, since before I was 10. My wife and I are currently separated as we both deal with our individual issues with depression, anxiety, etc, as well as seek couples counseling. We have been married 8 years, together 10, and have a 2 12 year old son. ampx200B Last Friday, I was given an ultimatum at work. I am the director of advertising amp marketing for one of the largest independent automotive groups in the Southeast United States. I was told, in so many words, that I had a week to prove my worth or lose my job. Never mind that I have reduced our spending by 45 since I started, and brought in triple my salary in additional new business due to digital marketing efforts I implemented in the organization, all the while maintaining the original sales output of our business. I was given exactly zero direction as to how to prove my worth. Needless to say, the last week has only served to heighten my stress and anxiety. ampx200B Ive never been a very physically affectionate person. I get that from my mom, a survivor of sexual abuse when she was a child. But yesterday, I really needed a hug from my wife. I just wanted to hold her in my arms, breathe in her scent, and feel like everything was going to be alright. ampx200B I realize, cognitively, that this process is a good thing for our lives. We are on the road to personal healing and healing as a couple. But that doesnt make this season any easier, and a hug from my little boy doesnt do for me what one from my wife would.",

    "How to get myself moving again Ive been suffering from severe depression for the last 18 months. Culminated in a suicide attempt back in December. After that I managed to get myself back on my feet after a while, started therapy and was working on a course I cared about. Just under a month ago, I visited where I used to live to catch up with some friends etc. I felt ready for it. It was a mistake though and it threw me back into a severe depression. Actually my therapist believes I am suffering from PTSD and going back seems to being back a lot of negativity. After 3 weeks of suicidal thoughts, sleeping 18 hours a day and just feeling awful... Im feeling slightly better again, but still not back in a positive place. Id like to get started again on my course and to begin to build back healthy habits. But I sit in front of my laptop and Im really struggling to get myself to do anything at all. Are there any techniques I can use to begin to build up some motion? I know once things begin to move Ill start to feel better again, and long term hopefully therapy and medication can fix this bind Im in... but short term Im struggling to take that first step.

    "13 years old. Wanna die Hello Reddit. This is my first post. I have read some post of other people here so I think I want to share my thoughts so that I can get help and your options on how can I be better. First off I live in Hong Kong. I have been studying for a while. I am now having a never important exam that I need to have soon. I have been studying for 247 but never get any results. I dont like studying. But out of studying. I have no hobbies and friends. I am not good at sport and art or even music. I can just study. I need to improve myself. But I cant. I get that being top 5 in my grade is nice. However I can never feel happy. I hate my teachers. They always force us to do the work in their ways. I wanted to die. I cant find the meaning of life. I cant find joy. I wanted to die. Every thing I have done is trash. I cannot find anything that will make me happy. I tried talking to my parents. However no one cares. They just said oh. And that is all. I really needed help but I cannot find anyone that cares. All my classmate are depressed and wanted to suicide. I need help. I will update soon. Thanks I got to study bye Reddit.",
    "How will I ever know if I’m well enough for a relationship? Ive been suffering from depression for as long as I can remember and suicidal thoughts for the past 4 years they started around the time I was about to enter uni. One thing that I have always believed is that, before I even consider any sort of romatic relationship, I need to work on bettering my mental health drastically and thus gain enough emotional maturity. However, Ive failed to define how much emotionally maturity is just enough for me to start considering myself worthy of a relationship. Thanks to a supportive family, medication and plenty of therapy, Ive bettered myself far beyond what I thought I was capable of. I havent had serious suicidal thoughts in a couple of months and Ive been able to confront situations which before wouldve emotionally crippled me for weeks. I still have a lot to work on, specially in terms of social skills, but atleast I can find some joy in my day to day life. So my question is how will I ever know when Ill be mentally stable enough for me to even consider seeking a relationship? Or am I just overthinking all of this? For context Im 21 M English isnt my first language, so Im sorry if my sentence structure is a bit wonky.",

I really dont have the mental strength to deal with a shitty one after finally asking for help.

When I told her my feelings about my father she snapped at me like You cant say things like that! or You cant feel like that!...

I had an amazing girlfriend who was the first to actually seem to care about me. Little thoughtful actions here and there, it was so nice. But then i noticed a disconnect in her. It came out of the blue. Not wanting to be touched and becoming easily angered and frustrated with me. I brought up what i have been noticing and asked what she thought about it. And she replied something along the lines of im completely over this, bye. Just out of the blue... i cant comprehend what just happened. I dont know where this came from. I just think i wasnt enough for her, and she probably has better guys lined up waiting for her. Ive relapsed into my dark self. Shutting out everyone and not treatung myself well.

    "Im scared i will never have friends again I have had major depression and anxiety my entire life, but i stopped seeing a counselor years ago. In 2016 i had friends that i would hang out with that were also my coworkers. We drifted apart and its my fault. After getting a different job i had a lot of coworkers and some would ask to hangout with me, but i always refused. Something changed in me where i began to completely self isolate and push away anyone who tried to come close to me. Im an introvert, so i keep trying to convince myself that i dont want friends. But the truth is im scared of never having friends again. I realized that truly the only close friends i have in my life are my boyfriend that i live with, my mom, and my boss. Im grateful for them, but i feel self conscious because i dont have any other friends my age. I deleted all my social media because seeing my old friends hangout together hurts, as well as seeing posts of people with their friend groups. I waste too much time comparing myself to others. But now i feel 10 times more lonely without social media. How do i get out of this? I am too scared to reach out to old friends. Is it normal to have no friends?

    "The days have nothing to offer for me: Looking for projects or hobbies to ease depression I would love to play tennis and visit the gym more often but 1. they all contain socializing as there are people, so my social anxiety makes it incredibly hard for me and 2. now there is Corona. Other things like academic aspects, going deeper into a topic, studying neuro science or pharmacology esp. neuroscience was a love of mine, I spent a lot of time with it and it was the reason for me starting the bachelor in psychology is almost impossible for me because depression makes me dumb, disabled and very restricted in thinking or making. Im sorry for the long text. Thanks to everyone who read until here. What are your thoughts? Do you have experience with this and somehow managed to improve the situation and feelings? Do you have ideas for projects or hobbies I could try to get into and maybe find a passion in to kill my feelings of emptiness, negative thoughts and self worth issues? I would be happy about any idea, anything, thats somehow manageable even when being depressed and socially anxious. Something I can hold onto, improve in and get feelings of success and self worth or skill. Something that distracts me from negative thoughts and psychological pain of depression.

But they refuse to let me go until I talk to them. But I have nothing to talk about. I have many, many reasons as to why Im depressed and at the same time none at all. I dont want to talk to them about it. Im getting a therapist soon and Ive talked to my doctor a little already, but they cant seem to respect the fact I dont want to talk to them about it. Please help me. What can I say to them to convince them? Is this normal? Do I really have to talk to them about it, even though Im already getting help?",
    "My ex girlfriend makes me want to kms I still love her. Ive tried multiple times to separate myself from her but it never works. I always end up going back to her because I lover her so much and was the only person to ever make me feel legitimately loved. Recently, she told me she wasnt going to be answering me much on Snapchat because she has final exams. Which is fair. Yet, I see her on her snap map shes active fairly often whilst also posting on her story. Ill be on delivered for hours on end and this isnt the first time this has happened. However, when we do talk, she tells me she loves me and how I was the only person shes ever truly loved. Shell call me daddy and fantasize about us having the cutest sleepovers. Worst yet, she told me awhile ago she still loves one of her other exs. The dude doesnt even care about her depression and just uses her for sex. She doesnt see that though. I cant do this anymore. Shes tearing me apart. I just want to kill myself to make this halfdecade nightmare come to an end.",
    "Loving one is Depressed :/ Hey guys, so i was daiting with a girl and after trying and trying she couldnt get any feelings for me. We got into a big conversation about it after 2 months. She never told anybody and never ever talked about it with somebody. She told me that she is Depressed. I asked for some reasons and when it started. She told me that it started in high school because her parents have really high hopes in her and pressuring her pretty much. She is 19 now. I feel like she told me as well the reason why she cant love me is because of her depression. I told her that im ready to help her anytime and all. But she doesnt want help and really doesnt like it when others help her. She doesnt cry infront of anyone because thats a symbole of weakness she tells me. I really care about her. It even feels like it hurts me more then her to a point. I dont know what to do. And i feel like if i will be there for her that one day she might feel how it is to love somebody. Since she told me that she never loved someone really. So if anyone could give me a tip on how to handle the situation that would be the greatest thing ever. I also asked her this question on a scale to 010 if 0 is that she loves her life and most things are going well and 10 is i want to kill myself as soon as possible. She answered 8. Im really concerned. And getting a therapist isnt an option as well for her. She would never take any pills either or so. She isnt Religious, she feels the best if she is just alone and if she has her quietness. She feels pressured if she is outside with her friends etc.. She also doesnt find relationships appealing. Maybe because she never had a goodreal one with feelings but that is just an assumption. She has guilty feelings because she started daiting me and wishes me to find a better one. She doesnt really like herself etc etc. Dont understand me wrong. Outside she is a extrovert, like nobody would know that she is actually depressed im sure.",
    "Why do I feel so shitty Yeah I post here like everyday, I cant get myself to do any of the things I say Ill do. I feel like Ive done everything I could do at this point, so why do I feel so shitty? I feel so tired and emptyheaded even though I really need to start on a paper for school. I just cant make myself get up to do it, I feel like I cant even start bc I am so weighed down by my own thoughts. I feel ugly, useless and I wish I could just get over that, learn to accept it in the back of my mind as something I cant change so I could actually do shit. I dont know what else I can do. Going to try to email my dr tomorrow, but I guess I wont if I dont get a good start on this paper bc Im spending so much money on college, literally cant afford to not do my best or get a shitty grade. I eat healthy everyday, try to lose weight but of course its very slow, but I just feel like I just sit around and rot and I dont know how to get out of that. Thank you for reading or any advice, I really will try to take it but again I just feel like its impossible to get myself to do things that arent immediately easy. I really do try not to be lazy and useless, I dont know why its not working out.",
    "Everything is going downhill again. I felt that for a couple months things were going well and I was finally on track to getting my life together. this pandemic has kind of uprooted everything and I feel super isolated and demotivated again. I cant get myself out of bed most days let alone study for my degree im a med student, exercise or eat. The main thing is I just think about how much of a failure I am, how everyone hates me and how worthless I am. Anyone got experience with getting themselves out of a rut like thiscurrently feeling the same?",
    "It’s painful to keep going Its been awhile since I confessed to my parents about my emotions and problems. Ever since then, theyve been easier on me and did their best to make me happy. But its only gotten worse, I feel guilty that I added stress on my parents when they already had enough to deal when raising me. I got better at first but it keeps going downhill, Im not improving at all. My dreams and motivation to live is slowly fading away, but I dont want to hurt anyone anymore. I dont want to sit through this, I want it to end so badly. Ive met a therapist and it didnt help much. Im not entirely sure if medication even helped me. My friends are here for me but I hate to bother them so much, I feel guilty for taking up their time. I want to end it here, it feels like its never gonna improve.",

    "Running out of options At 30 ywars old, Ive been on a total of 8 antidepressants and anxiety meds since I was 14. A lot of things work for a while and then just...dont anymore. Ive been telling my psychiatrist that my current meds work fine, because the last thing I tried had horrible side effects and I didnt want to go through more of that again. In truth, Im not doing well. My depression is very much chemical and not situational. I feel like crying all the time for straight up no reason. I feel like...how much more can I try? Is the rest of my life going to be just a cycle of medications until theres nothing left? Does anyone else feel this? Have you found other things to try?",
    "I don’t know how to help my depressed friend. Hello everyone, Ive come here for help or advice on what to do for one of my good friends. This might be long because theres a lot to unpack here. She19 has dealt with depression ever since middle school. I didnt know her at that time, only the past couple years and this year has she started opening up to me. She comes from a family that is overly strictly Christian. Both of her parents dont really believe in mental illnessmental help and her mother constantly gaslights her saying her depression isnt real and gets told to just suck it up or that she doesnt have anything to be depressed over. She tells me all the time about how shes tired, feeling sick constantly, body aches, has zero energy all of the time. It doesnt help that she works 40hweek. Ive been pushing seeing a psychiatrist or counselortherapist, and she wants too, but she also suffers from severe anxiety and absolutely despises the thought of hiding something like that from her parents because even just thinking about it sends her into a anxiety attack of sorts. Recently though, I feel like its gotten worse. Whats even worse is that Im the only person she talks to about this sort of thing, or I guess the only person she really talks too often in general, but recently shes started to push me awaydistance herself. I dont know if she means too, or if shes doing it purposely, but I dont know what to do. This scares me. Im trying to be there as much as I can but its starting to become difficult. This breaks my heart and I dont know what to do. Thanks for taking the time to read this. Ill answer any questions best I can.",

Yet Ive never gone far to act on my suicidal thoughts and I know I dont harm myself. But Im tired of living this way. Tired of struggling with major Depression, anhedonia, anxiety and chronic headachesmuscle tension. Sometimes I think, if I have no fear of death then why dont I just do something crazy with my life and just go for my dreams and just push myself to exercise more. But I dont even know what my dreams are now. I dont know what I like anymore and its hard to enjoy things. I just watch shows or try to take walks and keep avoiding my responsibilities. Ive been losing my confidence and losing sight of myself. I keep praying for some sign with the little wavering faith I have.. Others have been praying for me too. But I just dont feel connected with people as much even tho I have some friends that have been checking up on me... I just dont feel close to them. I dont feel good or necessarily sad, just mostly apathy and emptiness. I dunno what to do with myself. I found purpose before but then I lost it when I became depressed again. I feel like I cant tell what helps my body anymore. What keeps you going ? What makes you feel a little happy ? People tell me to live for myself or my parents tell me to live for them but I just cant seem to muster up the courage to wake up early in the morning or think about finding a job again.",
    "I have lost all my friends and am stuck in a nightmare. I spent the last 45 minutes carefully putting together my story and tried to tell exactly what happened in the past year, but then the Reddit app decided to commit suicide before me and I am too furious to write all of this shit again, so Ill just get straight to the point I have lost all my friends. I get especially sad because even my best friend we have kissed several times... just doesnt care anymore. My mother doesnt support me at all. She even keeps insulting me and makes things a lot worse. I seriously dont want to live here anymore. Or even living in general, but thats not really the point of this sub. And my father? I dont even know his name. Absolutely no contact whatsoever. I have nobody. I get insanely sad when I see other people having a good time, because Im stuck in this nightmare of not having any social contact whatsoever. But hey, at least I mastered social distancing before this Corona thing happened and I have no problem isolating myself... cause thats exactly what I did for the past nine months or so. I dont even need an external trigger like seeing other people having fun and I just get tears out of nowhere and I constantly think about what has happened to me. I sometimes dont even go to school because I would see people which mean a lot to me but treat me like a peace of garbage. I am terrible at school. Before Reddit crashes again, Ill just leave this here and yeah suffering is fun.",

Ill be able to afford it in September when I start working fulltime, but its a long way away. Ive tried everything and Im close to losing it. If I never had a mother, Id consider ending it all, so I want to get help now, which is why Im considering meds.

    "I need ideas.... Im about to be 33 years old, have never been able to get a job due to a lack of abilityskills and the fact that I was born with disabilities  the big one being a developmental disability Spina Bifida. Whats more, I have little interest anymore in attempting to GAIN any skills due to unbelievable levels of frustration and depression Im also inquiring about this in a disability subreddit. Anyway, outside of forcing myself to TRY to learn skills that I have absolute interest in whatsoever and am convinced are still far from any sort of guarantee of being able to land me a job, what can I do to stave off intense boredom everyday, repeating the same routine of sitting on my fat, lazy, SEVERELY work ethiclacking ass all day doing nothing but watching t.v. which sucks during the daytime when all it is  is repeats ive seen dozens of times, and surfing the internet which Ive done so much by now that Im actually bored of the internet to some degree LOLSMHFML. Im hopeful that when I finally get the call that I can move into an apartment building that is specificaly for lowincome PwD, that in time Ill either be able to buy my own video game system or a holiday or something will roll around and get somebody to buy me one as a gift. That will at least give me a third thing to do in addition to perhaps when I live there and my SSDI slightly increases due to the fact that I wont be living with my parents anymore, MAYBE Ill have enough disposable income to also watch movies from time to time? I know most of you are going to say that I need to volunteer, and while that is a good idea and was doing that briefly in the past before they got rid of me because they needed to use me more than I could offer, I am currently recovering from a series of 3 surgeries, and am not really at a point where I can feel comfortable leaving the house and volunteering like that  if I could even find something youd be surprised how hard it was for me to find something in the first place.",
    "How do I help my girlfriend My girlfriend 27 has slowly been sinking into depression, and I have no clue as to how I can help her. These last few months have been tough on her especially the last two. Her parents have started talking about divorce and its beginning to get ugly between them. Her mother calls her and vents about it and it usually leaves her angry. Her brother who has recently moved out of their parents house in January was just put in a psych ward for evaluation because his schizophrenia and paranoia have gotten the better of him since hes moved out. This is his second time being admitted. My girlfriend had a tremendous amount of pressure put on her for the last couple months from her parents to watch over him since they live out of town. Since hes been admitted her depression has crept up on her. Shes doesnt want to do anything but sleep and cry. Im always there by her side but do give her space for her self so that Im not overbearing on her. Lately shes been going on about how she wishes she could just end it all and kill herself because all her pain would go away and it would be easier. This isnt the first time shes said something along these lines. Shes never tried to hurt herself in that sort of way, but it does concern me. Shes been visiting a therapist lately and it seems to help her a bit but its only been her 3rd session, and she hasnt completely opened up on the subject with her. This morning she texted me that I havent been giving her the attention she needsdespite being with her and doing everything for her when I come home from work. Im trying really hard to help lift t her spirits and nothing picks her up. Even the dates we try to have do help. Half way through she wants to call it a night so she can go home to sleep and lay down. Im not sure what to do anymore. I love her to pieces and want the girl I fell in love with back but I dont know how to get her out of this funk.",

My brother was physically abusive cunt. Both Bro and Father were almost always drunk, or high as fuck on pot. In my youth We had I think it was 3 TVs. 2 for the family, 1 bro got from somehow probably dumpster diving. My father would use all 3 for his precous fucking sports shit. Hed have a completetantrum if he missed a play or some super important second of a fucking god damn play. Mother and him would have fights. SHed always leave notes threating to leave. I think I tried to uncously devise ways to not be home much because of that shit. Grandpa was just an asshole. I loved him, dont me wrong, but the motherfucker was a distant asshole. His wife spent most of her time shitfaced. I dont know how we managed to keep it together for enjoyable dinners that were legit great. Bro would come home drunk and start beating or kicking me to get the fag out of you and make you a man. HIs fucked up girfriends got off on that.

    "Anyone here have reverse seasonal affective disorder - i.e.: summer depression? If so, could use some advice It took me months to recover Bc I couldnt find any type of add on medication that I could tolerate that helped. During these spells I literally feel as if Im drugged  I am searching for words, I have no energy. I feel as if Im literally impaired or like I have taken a sedative. I understand it must sound dramatic, but Ive not been able to find anything medication wise that is able to help. I had a gene site test and Ive tried the meds listed in my green bucket and the side effects were so intense I couldnt continue on them, not to mention theyre not covered by our insurance so we paid over 1500.00 last summer on meds that didnt work. I find it difficult to find other people who have this and especially difficult to convey to my prescribing Dr. what Im going through. Additionally, I dont understand why it just happened so recently and without much warning like cause and effect. I have had depression most of my adult life and have been able to manage it with medication and lifestyle changes, but this summer thing is a different animal. Now its June and Im hoping that I can do some prevention as I feel like Ive exhausted meds. options. I have an appointment with my provider this week and I need to be as pro active as I can now in case I have this experience again. I just dont know what to ask for at this point, nor what to even do  or if I even have to do anything. Maybe it wont happen  I mean anything is possible, but I feel like I need to at least try to be prepared. Anyone have experience with this and any tips? I am thinking of preparing myself for a ketamine infusion or something this year. I just cannot imagine going through it again Bc it lasted so long this past summer well into the fall and I got to the point of being so low it was scary. A Dr I see occasionally suggested planning a vacation during the time when I usually feel this come on  sounds good, but also  could be a train wreck. Anyway  anything would be helpful.

    "Just found out the girl I’ve speaking to the last 7 years is talking to someone else. Need some advice please. Hi, Throw away account just cause I dont feel real comfortable posting this on my main account. Also excuse the formatting If its not correct, and the length. Im a 26 year old male whos had a thing for their best friend I know right for the last 7 years known her for 14 years and I only just found out tonight that the reason shes been ignoring me for the last week is because shes speaking to another male. Shes known Ive had the feelings for her for the last 7 years and she always tells me she doesnt feel the same way. Weve had so many arguments over some real stupid shit like her blocking me on social media when she goes out so I dont see any photos of her with guys because she knows I get real upset about it. Every time we have the conversation of my feelings I always ask her to be honest with me and tell me if shes talking to someone, because itll hurt me less coming from her rather than me finding out the hard way, and she always tells me no. The last time we had this conversation was 2 weeks ago. Fast forward to tonight, I had a mutual friend come over who I havent seen in around 2 years who asked me if I still have feelings for her. Me not wanting to show my emotions said I dont, so she then followed by saying oh my god can you believe shes talking to name. I was like wtf are you talking about? She then began to tell me how she has been talking to our mutual friends friend for the last 23 months. She then began to show me all these photos and messages that the mutual has shown her, so I got to see everything with my own eyes. I always had a feeling she was hiding something from me but I always got the answer no from her so I always ignored. Shes my best friend, shes literally the reason Im still alive. Ive been through hell and back with her, and I value her friendship so much that I can get through all the suffering and pain I have when shes around just so I can spend some time with her, but all she does when she comes over is sit on her phone for hours and just smiles at it.",

    "Everything fell apart after a failed business and a failed psyche. Figuring out next steps. Got back on adhd med in 2019, went and got a low paying but close IT job in September. Continued the Zoloft taper, and was okay until I began reaching the lower doses and as the winter kicked in the depression and suicidal ideation began to really kick my ass again. The job isnt in the field I want, Im spending most of the pay paying off credit cards I was using for the business. Now Im 6 months in to the low paying IT job, with 6 figures worth of student debt to pay off, stuck at home with no savings parents have no savings and are financially irresponsible... I blame myself but partly blame them for letting me take out so much to go to school when I couldve gone to a great local state school with my grades.. Im near NYC so thats where Ive been applying to a bunch of jobs but with basically no luck, apparently my degrees are worthless. Im still in a very anxious state and dont think Ill continue my Zoloft taper for a while, honestly Im about as anxious as I was back during the klonopin withdrawal. I could reach out to alumni from my school but I hesitate based on my current state of affairs. The depression plagues me a bit more lately, and I cant tell but I think the IT job may even be adding to my depression. Its relatively easy and keeps me out of the house and around guys my age which is nice. I think the years of being on Klonopin and Zoloft are really taking a toll on my mind as I try to get off. I cant think original thoughts, its just the same thing every single day, like a nightmare groundhog day. I appreciate anyone who took time to read through this post, really struggling to figure out my next steps, feel like Ive been stuck in the same headspace of suffering for a year and a half now. I keep telling myself the same story and it doesnt get me anywhere. Thing is this story seems to be the only thought stuck on replay every day. Just how different things couldve been.

His days come in waves of really highs until one day everything comes crashing down and gets really bad for a few days before turning around and slowly getting better until the cycle repeats. I know hes falling into depression and Ive mentioned therapy but he claims therapy doesnt help for this. I know hes very lonely and feels as though he has nothing to do besides eat, work, and sleep because hes new to the area he lives in. He says everything bad happens to him and he just feels empty and useless. How do I help show him how special he is and support him without constantly nagging him to seek therapy? How would you want your gf to help you when you dont live in the same city?",
    "Alternative Treatments? After almost a decade of therapy and meds, Im officially treatment resistant. I dont think I can keep going with how I feel but I dont want to give up. So Im looking for alternative treatments to typical psych drugs. I 21F have depression dysthymia, cyclical depression, anxiety GAD, panic, OCD with dermatillomania, and PTSD. Im currently on Pristiq and Abilify but they dont work. Some things Ive tried 1. Dozens of prescribed meds Zoloft, Prozac, Xanax got addicted, Cymbalta, Buspar, hydroxyzine, bupropion, Trintellix, Wellbutrin, etc. 2. Therapy talk, exposure, acceptance, etc. 3. Supplements NAC, ltheanine, caffeine, vitamin B, vitamin D 4. Illegal drugs mescaline, LSD, LSA 5. Legal drugs Siberian motherwort, dagga, CBD not in a legal marijuana state, kava kava tried today, helped but worried about liver  interactions with other meds I cant afford ketamine therapy. Id consider microdosing LSD but I dont have access to it currently. Anyone got any other ideas? Im kind of at the end of my rope here.",
    "What is the point? I have been suffering from depression i suppose all my life. However, acknowledgment of it only came 34 years ago. Since acknowledging i have depression, each passing year since I get worst and worst. These last two years have been my lowest with contemplation of harm getting harder to ignore. My 30th birthday was earlier this year and 4 days leading to it the idea of not seeing that birthday was painfully strong. I have no social life. the one friend that i confided in, that relationship has drastically changed. I have no romantic life, and havnt dated in 6 years. and i have no career, recently quitting my job as my mental health plumited, however now i dont think i am good enough for any job so the motivation to look just brings about anxiety and self hate. Note that i have been on lexapro for the last 5 months with my dossage being raised last week, and although it helps regulate my moods a littler better, I am still incredibly sad and hate the pathetic state of my life. I also started therapy the same time i got the perscription and see them one a week. However, although talking out my feelings gives me temporary relief i still dont know the tools needed to be better. I am incredible lonely and dont want to feel this heaviness and self hatred anymore. I guess the reason for my post is to find out if anyone has genuinely overcome their depression to the point that they can say they are truly happy. Or is this something I will have to fight with for the rest of my life, because if it is then what is the point?",
    "Does anyone else feel like they deserve to feel depression and feel shitty all the time? Im just curious if this is a normal feeling. I might have options to get out of my depression, like certain pills, maybe PMS pills antidepressants seem to never work but my depression gets 10 times worse around my period and maybe counseling would work. Maybe these things would work if I tried them again even if they havent in the past, but for two reasons I haventbesides cost. First I dont think theyd work or the side effects to meds wouldnt be worth it. But second and perhaps more important idk that I want to get better, I feel like I should live with all the shitty feelings and guilt, like I have to or deserve to. I dont do it for attention, maybe once in my life when I was much more lost, when all this depression started to get bad, but not anymore, I barely even talk about my depression to anyone anymore. Is this normal? Or common? To feel like you deserve misery? Or am I actually just being an attention whore throwing a pity party for herself or something stupid like that? I dont want to be that.",
    "I don’t feel like I’m enough and I need help Since the age of like 11 I would often get waves of depression and anxiety suddenly. Im mostly fine for a majority of the time and after each wave I try to pick myself up and go on like nothing happened, but anything either I or anyone else does could get me back down the same rabbit hole of wanting to die. My current theory is it stems from stress related issues caused by a dysfunctional household earlier in my life because of my parents divorce. It was rather messy, mostly because of my father. With these waves of depression I often find myself getting very paranoid that people are speaking about me behind my back and that everyone hates me. I also start to believe that Im absolutely worthless and a pile of living garbage. I get really distant from my friends and family and my immediate reaction is to block them on all social medias and not talk or look at them. Lastly, while these waves happen with no pattern that I could sense I always seem to carry this guilt and shame of my past which leads to my almost always sad behavior. If anyone has any advice please help, Im so tired and I have no hope.",
    "Does anyone else just not want to be alive but isn’t actively suicidal? So Ive just been feeling really depressed in a really long time. I would say last year I was extremely suicidal and I was on the verge of ending my life. But then it got complicated I got help and blah blah... I thought my meds were working after I reached a therapeutic level of 125mg of Zoloft but Im not sure anymore. These overwhelming feelings are coming back. I mean Im not actively suicidal or anything. But then today my sister asked me where I wanted to live in the future, and the first thing that cam to mind is that I didnt want even live. Im just so tired of this perpetual cycle of shit. Its really getting draining. Anyways does anyone else feel this way, dead inside a little I guess. And do you guys think my meds arent working? I was okay until like 4 PM today. I would appreciate your opinion. And Im totally fine so you dont need to message me, please save it for someone in urgent need! I am receiving regular therapy and am well supported",
    "Do you ever see someone happy and it makes you depressed Ever so often I go on Instagram and I always get depressed afterwards. Not because of people showing off their stuff or saying perfect their life is because I know thats bullshit because of the people themselves. They have personalities and lives and friends and dont depersonalize when they go in public theyre comfortable enough in their own skin to be confident enough they have some care to wake up.

    "A happy lonely girl I have a girlfriend and she was diagnosed with clinical depression. She always seems happy, she likes to make corny jokes and we always enjoy each other. But there will always a day she will tell that she feels alone, that she hates herself that she cant even look herself in the mirror and says that shes a burden to everyone. It really hurts me everytime I hear those words from her. I always try my best to comfort her, even though Im not with her physically I will talk to her over the phone without hanging out the phone and watch her until she fell asleep because thats the only thing that I can do. Worst feeling is I dont know what to do or what to say to cheer her up whenever she feels that extreme sadness. Also even in regular days, she cant accept compliments. I love her so much that I want to be with her in always. I want to be her shoulder whenever she feel sad. I am not that knowledgeable about how to handle things like this so Im seeking some tips or anything that can help me help her in her battles. Thank you.",

Then I move back in with my grandmother who pretty much hates me or feels like it. Most of my life she told me I never do anything or amount to anything and honestly. ampx200B I began pro wrestling and been in for about 45 years now, but I dont even have that anymore because of my limit of travel. Im unable to drive, and I have anxiety trying to drive on an actual street. I have no reliable ride for it and because of my limitations I will never get far for it. ampx200B The only relationships Ive had is online ones, and each one never led to meeting in real life. Dont get me wrong, I wanted too and tried to get there, but it never does. There always an excuse for each person Ive been with and even recently it has happened. I got no confidence to try a person face to face. But at least with an online relationship, I dont feel as lonely and keeps some depression away. ampx200B So yeah, that my life story and how I became who I am now. I do not have anything to look forward to in the morning, and I curse at myself for now randomly dying in my sleep. I feel like shit and the thoughts of suicidal grows stronger with each day. Make matters worse, it has become easier for me to gain weight and harder to lose weight as I age. So every time I eat, I just feel awful. Im going bald, my vision and my hearing is getting worse. Often told I look like a 40yearold man or something. ampx200B Hell, I cant even work longer than 20 hours, and even then it feels like it pushing it. Every time I work longer than those hours I get so stressed out and my depression grows worse. I could get more hours, but when I do, I feel worse about myself.

    "Help Please - Parents Sent Brother to Pacific Quest Hi all, My brother whose currently 10th grade has been struggling with depression and anxiety for a while, but my parentsI found out about it last year when he consumed an excess of benadryl in hopes to finally be able to get good sleep. From that time, hes started failing classes and has begun heavy marijuanaalcohol use even being hospitalized for the latter once. For what its worth, he routinely started talking about how his anxiety started getting better because he didnt care about school anymore and because he started smoking. My parents are doing all that they can and know how to do to help him out. I just got back from college on spring break, and they broke the news to me about why my brother wasnt here when I got backhe had just flown out to Pacific Quest PQ this morning.

My mom showed me a video, and it seemed suspiciously sugarcoatedidealistic, so I went on a reddit search to find out more. God damn. I thought it was just one post bashing PQ, but it seems that theres nearly nothing positive to say about it, other than the fact that it, relative to other similar programs, has a better quality of life and that seems like its not saying a lot at all. What do I do in terms of my parents, brother, and PQ? I really am terrified for my brothers well beingfrom reading, it seems that PQ is nothing but regressive for health. Should he stay?

    "My boyfriends depression So my boyfriend told me that he was in a bad place before he met me amp that nowadays the entirety of being with me hes been happy amp hasnt felt sad in a minute. Today somehow the topic of being sad came up amp I was like why would you be sad again? amp he responded with because it always relapses. Thats how depression works. amp I was speechless. I understood that he used to have breakdowns they all, 23 in total, included something that was about me. but I never guessed that hed have depression. Im a generally very happy person amp Im not sure how to deal with this. I dont think hes professionally diagnosed because I do remember him saying it feels like hes depressed but never said he was diagnosed. I dont want to doubt him but at the same time I dont think what hes feeling is something as severe as depression. I dont know what to do. Should I just support him either way? If so, how am I supposed to support someone when theyre having depressing episodes?",
    "Heavy Shame From Drunken Past He keeps telling me to forget about it, not linger in that place, and that hes forgiven me, but how can he? Hes been this amazing guy, and I was unemployed for about two years there, along with the drunk crap, and broke up with him and then felt shame and apologised in the morning way, way too many times over. Im aware that Im just living far too much in the past, but I cant get over this shame. I need help. I guess I just want to know if anybody else has ever felt similarly, and maybe, what helped them?",
    "No One Cares So Why Should I? I am not great with conveying my thoughts but Ill try. I feel like no one cares whatsoever. All of my friends have others to hang out with, and honestly they probably enjoy each other more than being with me. On top of this, I dont really know how to tell people Im not doing well for a few reasons. I always seem to get short responses like itll get better or Oh and then its left at that. No one knows how to help me, which is fair I suppose, but after so many cries for help, Ive given up. No one knows how to help and surely it must upset or annoy them hearing about me having a bad time, so I decided to lie. I dont tell anyone how Im really feeling except on rare occasions. Even then, its not usually helped. Im so useless to everyone by being this way, so instead Id rather put on a mask and fake happiness, that way no one has to bother. I dont care about myself, I just want others to be happy and if that means ignorance then thats fine I suppose. I dont think anyone should do this, but I dont carry the same standards for myself as I do others. Im sure itll be bad but I just dont know what else I could do. I wish I could just be better but its impossible. Everything hurts in my heart so much that sometimes it makes me nauseous. I cant stand living around people who barely notice me. I allow myself to get used to make others happy. I hate it, but Ive decided its logical if it makes others happy. Instead of two people hurting, I just do, all the time. In this sense, Im like a doll. Im used for whatever purpose and then discarded afterwards. It hurts so bad, but I dont know anything else. Im worried about asking for help since I feel like I disappoint others when I cant tell them whats wrong, or if what they say or suggest doesnt help. I dont know what I need honestly. Sorry to be a bother.",

    "Low functioning depression Hi reddit. The title of this post is quite ironical as Ive spent the last 10 minutes making a new account just so I could post this anonymously, have had to get out of bed for it and have finally dedicated myself to doing at least something today. Nonetheless, I see this situation as a minor bright spot in my current life and desperately need advice regardless. I am a senior highschooler from a lowincome family in Europe. Ever since I was 13 or 14 years old Ive been struggling with some kind of selfdiagnosed I never went to therapy for many reasons depression andor anxiety. The causes of such problems have changed throughout the years, but they were mostly linked with social anxiety, unhealthy amount of selfimposed academic stress and god knows what else. My first two years of high school were marked by drenching amounts of anxiety regarding new acquaintances, extremely low self esteem, low functioning due to stress and frequent suicidal thoughts and wishes. Over time, my social anxiety went away, with it most of my problems, and for the last year I havent felt as close as bad as I did before. I thought my depression finally disappeared, and that Ive changed as a person. Now, I know I was wrong. At the moment I am experiencing a great deal of stress caused by university planning. Like previously mentioned, I live in a lowdeveloped European country in a lowmiddle class family. My biggest chance to do something with my life is to go to university abroad, as universities in my country are pretty much shit. Ive dedicated all of my elementary and high school education to university planning, constantly striving for good grades, many extracurriculars and additional tests. And now, when the time has finally come to apply for universities and write my damn personal essays and send them, I blocked. I cannot make myself to sit and write the essays, as I am a huge perfectionist and am probably scared to start writing as I fear they wont end up good. The more time passes, the more stressed I am, the harder it is to focus, and it all ends up being a great, vicious circle.",
    "Do I have depression or am I overthinking? Ive been thinking about if I have some type of depression for a while but put off asking people about it because i dont want to seam like the person who feels sad and all of a sudden thinks theyre depressed. However I think its about time I ask. Every couple of days Ill have moments that can last 30 minutes to an hour or longer where Im not happy, not necessarily sad... just unhappy? even if the main feeling unhappy isnt happening if my friends ask me to go out with them after school I think about going along and then think that I wont have fun and start to dread the idea. This even happens with my girlfriend who I love but if she asks me if i want to come over the next day I will never say a definite answer, instead Ill say maybe or possibly just because I dont know how Ill feel like the next day. I also feel that nothing will bring me joy like video games, i will quickly get bored of them in these moments and try to think of something to do but everything I think of doing doesnt seem as if it would make me any less bored. In the mornings Ill think of the day ahead and absolutely dead it sop much that the night before I prep myself by saying why the next day is going to be good, this sometimes helps a bit but i usually run out of energy. I feel like i have a fair amount of symptoms of a less severe depression but from everything Ive read it seems that an episode lasts around at least a week.

    "Letting my boyfriend commit suicide. Please help. When I think about him being dead I get so many instrusive thoughts about him not being okay if there is an afterlife  that hes lonely, scared, or in more pain that he was here.

    "I’m not sure if I have depression, please reply, I made posts to other subreddits and no one answered and it’s making me feel even worse Im 16F btw. For many many years Ive been extremely upset with my weight and my looks. I hate everything about me, I could give you all the things I hate about my appearance in a heartbeat. Sometimes when I look in the mirror I think oh I dont look too bad and sometimes I think oh god I cant go out Im so ugly. My weight has become a really bad obsession. I think that because of problems relating to how I see myself I might have gotten and eating disorder? Im not sure because I cant self diagnose. But, I have lost noticeable amount of weight by eating 12 times a day and limiting my calories. And Im not sure if thats extreme dieting or an actual eating disorder. Im scared to go to the extreme and go underweight Im close to being it because I have a deadly disease and could die if Im not eating properly. And Im not too educated on EDs so Im not sure if Im being too dramatic. Back to my depression, I moved during 5th grade and had no friends until high school, people openly avoided me because I kept asking people if I could play with them. This one group of friends made it extremely obvious that they dont want to be near me, which hurt a lot. Lots of boys said behind my back and in my face that Im ugly, horrifying, repulsive, a ugly octopus, sewer rat, etc. That really hurt me back then, still now. And I do believe Im all those things theyve said. Then a miracle happened. I made a friend. She was a cool kid and the time I spent with her was the best Ive ever had with someone besides my family. Then after few months out of no where she acts like I dont exist. She never spoke to me and treated me like a stranger, and it hurt so much it still bothers me.

She gets angry at me for skipping classes, Rightfully so, but it still hurts because Im not doing this for attention or laziness and wants to talk to my guidance counselor and teachers. I know they are going to put it on me, because I am the one whos been skipping and not asking for help. Im trying to attend as much as I can and get assignments done, but its never enough. Its true this is my fault, but I feel like they dont understand that Im not doing this out of laziness Im doing it because I want to off myself and cant take this anymore. Ive been having suicidal thoughts more recently, but I dont think I will be believed. I dont know what I should do anymore. Im trying to bring up my grades and attend classes but my mind and body are so sick and exhausted. What do I do? Taking the death route feels easier than facing this. Theres so many things I want to do, but I dont think Ill be able to at the rate Im going.",
    "I’m done. Im done. I dont know why today is the day that broke the camels back, but I feel like bursting into tears. By all standards my life should be great. Loving parents, amazing spouse, Good inlaws, good paying job, nice new home, stable friends, and no major health problems. But I just sit here and writhe in emotional pain, I feel like driving my truck into a concrete barrier. Im an adult. What could I possibly be sad about? I tell people around me I dont feel right, like how Im abnormally stressed, anxious, or sad. Everyone dismisses me. Not a rude way but, in a manner like hey man we all feel that way sometimes. My loved ones around me feels so needy, like if I were to hand off an ounce of my pain it would shatter them. I sit here and smile, do my best to join in on the conversation and not draw undue attention to myself. My day to day job is being a Doctor, I get to help people and it makes me feel like I have purpose. But its not enough. I try to save money, not spend too much on myself, donate to others. But its not enough. I try to enjoy little hobbies, get outside, play with my dog, spend time with my friends. But its not enough. I still feel sad. I reach out on forums for depression and ask do I have a problem? Is it normal to feel this way? And not even the masses have comments for me. I dont want to commit suicide because I would feel too responsible for the pain and mess I left behind. But if I was told tomorrow is my last day, I dont think I would fight it much. I feel like help only comes if you do something dramatic. It makes me appreciate how brave people are for reaching out for help. Posting this is the best I can do. Im not sure if anyone will read this, but if you do, thank you.",
    "I feel like I can't anymore. When I was 15 I thought of killing myself almost daily for 5 months straight, I broke when my mother saw me have a panic attack and called me dramatic, I told her I wanted to kill myself, she told to do it. She has always been abusive, verbally and emotionally and I have been trying to get better on my own because going to therapy is so expensive and I am 18 and not allowed to get a job. My father died almost 2 months ago, he was the one who loved me, he was the one who heard me but now I have my mom that sometimes is nice and sometimes is the worst and a brother that when he gets mad threatens to punch me or slap me. I feel like life is just over, I haven been hours staring at my ceiling thinking how the world would be a better place without me, that I am worthless and I feel like I cant take this anymore. My country, Ecuador, doesnt have suicide lines and I feel so alone, this is my only way to reach help, please, please, help me, even if its a little.",
    "A friend you’re worrying about hasn’t been replying to you texts or talked to you in a week, what do you do? My friend gets really lonely, especially around Christmas and New year. This was my 2nd Christmas and New year since knowing them. On the 30th of Dec, something happened that made me so distressed, I had to go see them. After that, Ive been sending them 2 or 3 messages a day to see how they were doing. I tried to message open things that didnt force you to answer. The last text I send was on Friday and I havent checked the app as well to see if they were on... I feel worried and sad, because they are being quiet. What would you feel or think in this situation, what would you do?",
    "Those who’ve dealt with it longer than I - how? So Im a 20 y.o. F whos currently on her sophomore year in college. I was diagnosed with severe depression and a panic attack disorder about two years ago. Since then Ive dealt with two changes in medication, a suicide attempt and moving away to my own apartment and away from all my family and friends. Since starting school Ive realized Ive become incredibly isolated. The only time Ill have human touch is when my boyfriend visits me for the weekend, and unless a professor or a group member speaks to me, generally throughout the day I wont have a conversation with anyone. Even my parents dont talk to me everyday. Ive joined a DnD group and have made attempts to push myself out of this crippling isolation but how do you make friends when more than have your days are bad mental health days? My depression has worsened significantly since moving and to help myself I got a 3 month old puppy that Im training to be my service animal. Honestly, that baby is most of the reason I get out of bed as puppies dont care if you have depression  they need to be trained. Ive also made another doctors appointment to see about yet another med adjustment. I also got in contact with a therapist but I honestly dont see how it will help much being as though I can only go to one session a month. I just dont know how Im supposed to live like this? Like is this going to be my life from now on just barely struggling by with less than a hand full of people who would actually give a shit if I failed miserably? I just need to hear from more experienced depressed individuals how did you survive?",
    "26. Depressed, socially anxious, lost and suicidal. A big part of my brain focuses on high school and that fact that I pretty much did nothing during it besides smoke weed and drink. I had freinds but I feel like they werent genuine freinds, just other people who enjoyed partying like i did. Most of the summers I spent alone sitting at home. It was like that in middle school too. I remember joking to a kid on the bus in middle school, telling him I go home and stare at my wall for hours then i go to school. I never had a girlfriend in high school  just a few hook ups. I regret not joining the track team multiple people said i shouldve, I was really fast. I wish I had an intimate relationship in highschool. I was always pretty smart but I really just stopped caring about my grades at the start of freshman year. I had a lot of angst and spite against my parents and I attribute that to why I stopped giving a shit. Pretty much all i thought and cared about in high school was smoking weed. I shouldve been focused more on joining a club and my grades. Although marijuana was a huge escape that I initially loved I feel like it was one of the worst choices I made because it only made me more introverted. It also made okay with the fact that i was doing nothing with my life and not thinking about my future. I had one job as a bus boy which i quit after about 2 months. I graduated high school as a below average student wirh absolutely no clue what I wanted to do in college. I went to a community college for a month before dropping out. While there I felt extremely out of my element, only talked to fellow freinds from high school who also went there, and made zero new friends because of my social anxiety. After dropping out my life as an extreme recluse began. I worked but it was with my dad doing roofing and home improvement type work. I only hung out with one friend from high school and going to his house and getting drunk with his family at their house parties was the extent of my social life during this time. I spent most of the money I made with my dad on weed.",
    "Someone gave me this \"advice\"? Basically I just wanted to ask if this was reasonable advice. This person knows Im extremely suicidal and depressed and have a bunch of mental problems. They also know that Ive been the only one to advocate for myself for years for treatment. I am receiving treatment, and my therapist even says Ive been trying very hard. This persons advice to me was just, Just try harder. You can always try harder. And they refused to understand that sometimes you just cant try any harder, you reach your limit, or even that you might need the help of someone else to help get you through. They said that needing anyone elses help is toxic and unhealthy and thats using someone as crutch, you will never get better, etc. Just completely disregarding everything I am feeling and going through. Am I wrong to feel upset by this? I feel like its a bs answer to shrug off any responsibility as an important person in my life.",
    "I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts for as long as I can remember and it's only getting harder to reason against harming myself. I never had a catalyst or anything for my depression or suicidal ideations. Its just been present for a very long time. Ive gone through prescribed regimens of medication, seen counselors, stayed active and healthy, made friends very easily, and just overall tried to keep myself out there and try or experience new things to see if I could find that calling in life for myself over my life. Things have generally gone very well for me in life other than the numerous times I let my suicidal thoughts get the best of me and I either let shit fall apart or an attempt on my own life puts me down a notch. This has been something thats just always been present and feels very dominating as a part of who I am. It used to scare me and I used to want to feel better than this, but I just feel completely indifferent and empty to it and everything else in life now. I dont have the energy to pretend Im a normal person or talk to people, I dont experience any emotions, all of my old hobbies and such feel like a chore, and I cant envision wanting anything in the future. This depersonalization side of my suicidal ideations has been going on for a couple years now and more than ever I just cant find any reason or desire to stay alive. Ive been miserable for as long as I can remember and I know its not right, but, at this point I dont know any other mindset other then feeling this way. I know how to be a decent human being, I do good at work and such, Ive developed very close relationships in platonic and romantic senses before, but nothing makes it feel worth the effort at all. Im at my wits end and I got rope today and Im so afraid of how much itll hurt but I want this to be over with so bad and I just dont know what to do.",
    "I'm begging someone for support rn. Anyone I can honestly say Im at the lowest point in my life rn. Im a 26M, and Ive crashed and burned everything, destroyed every relationship in my life, and live in complete isolation. Ive had crippling depression and panic disorder ever since I was a child, and Ive never been so alone in my life. A mixture of substance abuse, panic, and depression has made it difficult to continue. I honestly dont expect anyone to truly gaf, but even to just pretend would give me a sense that Im not alone. Ive lived in poverty my entire life, my family was dirty and parents addicted to drugs, I was continuously sexually abused, and its created an endless amount of deep rooted issues in my mind. I also have severe bipolar disorder, and because of it I push everyone away with my craziness. My father left me when I was 4, my entire family except for my mom admitted they wanted me aborted. This includes my grandparents, aunts, etc. I was homeless with my mother, living in a car for the first 6 years of my life. Id had it by the time I was 13. I was never home, would stay at friends houses for weeks at a time, wander the streets, because going home was torture. Constant violence, fighting, yelling and neglect, with police constantly showing up at the house. My family never fed me, and I basically had to beg friends for food. At 13, I started using drugs because I was finally accepted by my friend group. I was constantly high, and everyone in school warned people to stay away from me. I was in and out of juvy, and literally the cops arrested me in the middle of class when I was 17, and I was expelled. My family disowned me, and my aunt was kind enough to let me stay with her until I was 18. It was the greatest act of kindness Ive ever known. At age 16, my met my first gf, and I jumped headfirst. I was wholeheartedly convinced she was the woman I was going to marry.",
    "I think I hate myself Sometimes I just do things to destruct my future self for no reason and I cant stop. For example I lie when its totally unnecessary and stupid, so that I later have to admit it or make up excuses, which is so uncomfortable. I also have a weird eating disorder so I overeat and dont stop even if it hurts and a few days after, I stop eating to kind of keep my body shape, because Im really insecure about that. I hate it but I wont ever change.",
    "I finally told someone. And now I just feel worse. Yesterday night I was texting a friend i had a few drinks and ended up telling him about my dark thoughts. I dont even know him that well, but at the time it was so easy. He was real kind and nice about it, and reassured me it was good to talk. But waking up today I just felt worse. I havent gotten out of bed and were well into the afternoon. I texted today, but no response. Maybe it was all a mistake. Maybe I shouldnt burden people with my problems. Ive always kept em to myself, why not now?",
    "Mother won't talk to me? I need advice. My mother wont associate with me because Im ugly. I know she is highly concerned with looks because I overheard her in a conversation with another lady in regards to that womans children. My mother said this about her children, Theyre very good looking arent they? My mother has since cut off communication with me saying only, Bye sweet. I dont have any family or friends and Im afraid my only option is suicide. I keep waking up every morning thinking Im not sure how Im going to survive a life of complete isolation. I need advice. Can you help me?",
    "Staying POSITIVE is ALREADY hard and now I am the caregiver to a SUICIDAL FRIEND I was pretty much unsure what to do so I wrote a letter to the family secretly I know where she stays and i made sure to text her mum that I had put a letter outside their house gate. They eventually texted back to express their gratitude but I did not hear from them afterwards... So again, she had her bouts of episode and meltdowns and I had to calm her down every single time. it gets exhausting for me as well. And I always feel that I am trying to fight against absorbing and feeling down from all of these. Recently, she went for a staycay and her mum called me. She was begging me to ask my friend to cancel it to which i have no influence on at all since my friend was really optimistic about this she initially had plans to kill herself during this trip but after meeting another psychologist, she kind of is delayin it. When her mum called me a second time, i was with my friend and my friend was really on the edge. She tried taking my phone away from me to talk to her mother but I stopped her. Her mum SAID thru the phone since i didnt know she is with you and you are still going to allow her to go for the staycay, ALL is on you. YOU SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY IF SMTG HAPPENS TO HER. I DONT CARE but you make sure she is safe. I was quite upset by this but politely ended the call as my friend tried grabbing the phone away from me. Ended up, she called her mum back only to shout and scream at her mum  berating the mum for calling me. Her mum was upset. The mum texted me and blamed me for my friends action. I replied to her saying I was sorry that that happened and that I tried calming my friend but she went hysteria instead. The mum later replied telling me that since my friend does not listen to her as a mother, i should be the one doing the advice and guiding my friend to the so called right path. She said that she leave me to take care of my friend for her. Im speechless guys.. I am so exhausted already but yet this happened??",
    "I've been alone for so long I think I'm losing communication skills I felt like I resembled a corpse because of how dead inside I really started to become, and even became more and more obsessed with death and wanting to be dead. Now that Ive been shy and lonely for so long when I actually try to talk to people I have a hard time forming the appropriate sentence to match what the person had said to me. Or I might form the sentence awkwardly making my point much harder to come across to them. I feel like I have to stop and really put together a sentence in my head before I can say it or else itll just not make any sense when the person Im talking to finally hears my response. Or Ill hesitate while talking and then itll mess up the flow of what I was talking about and I cant piece back together the sentence I was trying to say. Ive slowly became more and more self aware at how many times Ive had to just completely scrape a sentence midway through because of this hesitation while trying to speak, people probably think Im crazy by now. I have nothing interesting to tell people either so when Im at work and the person whos talking to me shares a story about them that happened recently I feel like Im not given back to the conversation because I have no story at all other than depressing stories to share in the conversation, so 910 times Im simply forced to only comment about their story instead of sharing my own stories. Otherwise I dont talk at all, not unless someone else starts up a conversation with me. I kinda dont even like talking to people anymore because it just feels like its getting really difficult to make a conversion work when Im a part of it. Only being able to reply to their experiences instead of giving them insight on my own personal experiences. I also have a extremely difficult time looking people in their eyes for more than a second, maintaining eye contact just feels really uncomfortable. I feel so much pressure from other people too, like if I drop something I instantly feel like everyone is watching me as I pick it back up. Or when I was in school literally just standing up to turn my paper in made me feel like people would judge me for my appearance or how I walked or whatever.",
    "I’m lost, stuck and desperate Im at a point in my life where I am extremely depressed and have strongly considered suicide. I always feel weak and tired, with no motivation or willpower to do the simplest of tasks. I feel like any motivation I have to better myself is weaker than my will to end my life. I live in a moderately poor house we have the money to put food on the table and pay bills, but the slightest slip and were homeless, Im 20 and dependent on my parents, my dad who is also depressed and unhappy with his job, my mom is chronically ill and bedridden for the most part. I love my parents to death, but I could never let myself ask them for help, Im already a burden enough as it is, and I couldnt live with myself if they felt any guilt for the way I feel and not being able to afford help for me. I tried to have a simple retail job that I thought I could handle so Id be able to support myself, but I had to quit on my first full day because I was too weak to physically stand the whole work day, and couldnt be of much use. It was the most embarrassing and shameful day in my life and that incident sent me even further into depression. The only reasons I havent killed myself yet is because I love my mom, and because I still have hope that someone out there will someday choose to love me, and the prospect of raising a family with that woman is the only hope I havent lost. But the more and more time progresses, even that hope is starting to dwindle. I feel like my cowardice is whats really getting in the way of my killing myself, but I dont know how long it will keep me back. What can I do?",

The past year has been intense and lately my husband is on the brink of a breakdown. Its tough on me and the kids as well, Im tired. Ive thought about giving him space from me and parenting, but Im not sure of it will help him or drive him even further because it might feel like a let down. . What do you think?

    "Is there anything that could help with the numbness part of depression ? Depression manifests as a variety of symptoms such as fatigue, insomnia, loss of energy, anxiety ,negative thinking, emotional numbness, loss of motivation...etc So far I found many ways to manage the symptoms of depression but I didnt find anything that helped with the numbness part where you just dont feel anything or care about anything at all nothing makes you happy, sad, cry, your mood is just flat all the time I wasnt always like this I was a normal person with hobbies, ambitions and goals but I developed this condition this year and it stripped me of everything. I lost all feelings for my gf I lost all drive for my dreams, they mattered nothing. I had a blank mind I couldnt socialize I kinda stopped contacts with family and friends basically I lost everything that made meaning in my life. Its impossiblemeaningless to live in this condition. The numbness part is so common with clinical depression  not depression feeling because of a bad day  and I saw many posts on reddit that I could relate with so I know that Im not alone suffering from this condition so anyone has this symptom found anything that could help with it ?",

    "I'm seriously considering suicide again. I wont label my social issues, as I havent got a clinical diagnosis like anyhting else on this list, but I think it fits more into the antisocial category than asocial or social anxiety, because of my negative and possibly misanthropist views. I have 2 past suicide attempts, once by asphyxiation, and the other by insulin overdose. Now, Im just wasting away, induging myself and slowly poisoning myself. My only friends 3 or 4, whom Ive always valued highly, are distancing away from me slowly, after nearly 6 years of friendship to be honest, I dont blame them, because Im fucking weird to hang around. But it does hurt quite a bit. I have a cousin 3 months younger than me, who has a much better and more successful life than me. His father my moms younger brother by 1 year is the current president 33rd of the KoreanAmerican Association of Chicago and a Northfield Township trustee. My cousin has a better social life, better health he is ripped as one would describe, and taller than me, while I am barely keeping my muscle mass together. Im 56kg, 170cm, has better looks than me, is a better student no problems in school and is just allaround a better person than me. People follow him around, and as much as it hurts my pride to admit this, I am envious that girls just follow him around. My family isnt very supportive neither. My aunt and uncle cares for me I hope but treats me as if I were some lazyass scum, because their son is objectively better than me, even though I am doing my fucking best, trying not to die from a DKA every day. I lost 56 pounds in 2 weeks, all muscle mass, because I dont have much body fat. I excercise semiregularly 45 mins a day, 34 hours a wekk, maybe, I study, I do what everyone else does, and I even put more time into it all possible because I assist school once a month now, all assignemnts are submitted through a school intranet. My grandparents the ones alive clearly cares more for my cousins than me, and they dont necessarily hide that.",
    "I'm unsure whether I sexually harassed somebody or not, and as a result, I'm extremely depressed. Hi, guys. Im a 23 yearold man with Aspergers Syndrome, and one of the two themes of my pureO OCD over the last two years has been a fear of doing something sexist  this is a manifestation of the moral scrupulosity element of OCD. For the first time ever last summer, I sent a flirtyprovocative text to a woman via the Ask feature on Tumblr, while nonanonymous. The message was an abbreviation followed by a question mark. I remember the post I found her through specifically saying that she was open to receiving these types of messages, yet my brain is trying to convince me that this is false, and obviously because its been so long now, I cant remember what her blog is called and have felt a compulsive need to find her, but cant. I want to die, because I dont want to live with the shame and guilt associated with having potentially sexually harassed somebody, but Im so very certain that she was soliciting these messages, as well as answering similar messages from men on her blog and being receptive to them. This is what my recollection was last September when I first reflected on it. I wasnt trying to be strange at all, I was trying to be more confident than I had usually been in this circumstance. Please, help me.",

Ive had it controlled well for years but things happening all at once has just brought me to tears at this point. I have a bf, hes amazing but one thing that I would say is wrong with him is he doesnt know how to support me when Im like this. Hell ask whats wrong, If theres something specific Ill tell him, but its been so many things its just everything. And he doesnt know how to respond to that. It just makes me feel incredibly lonely. I havent been able to get out of bed yet 1.30pm here and he just happily stayed on his computer and now hes gone out. I just want to feel better, go about my day but I cant.

And with these other friends, I have plans in the future to go on a road trip across the country with. Its weird knowing that I know have other close friends, who my best friends dont even know. And it was weird coming back home, seeing my friends, and knowing that I dont even want to be here. I want to be back with my youth volunteer group. My friends were really happy I was back, but I cant possibly feel the same way under these circumstances. Im NOT happy to be back. I dont WANT to be here. My life is so depressing now. Almost every moment since Ive been back, Ive felt like Ive suffered. Sometimes, for brief moments, something has made me feel happy. And Ive felt content for that moment. But then I remember my current situation, and it feels like a pang to my stomach. I feel like I cant escape this world of misery. I know that COVID19 will blow over, Ill have a good summer with my friends here. And next year, Ill go on a road trip with my good friends from the programme. But right now I just feel empty.

    "How do I feel human again? For the longest time I have had the issue of feeling like a subhuman or a tool meant to have specific purposes, I have been struggling for the longest time with trying to accept Im a person too and deserve to be treated as such, that Im deserving of love, or to stop putting the needs of others before mine. I wont go into details about what originated this, because frankly no one wants to read Infinite Jest lengths of backstory, but Id like, if anyone can relate, to get some tips on how to ground myself again because Im feeling really, really disconnected from myself lately, even more so than usual, and its very hard to just go thru the motions to maintain the illusion of just being a normal, functional person which I do more for the sake of others than mine tbh. I fear that Ill be exposed as a subhuman and be further alienated from others if I cant keep up the façade and I dont have the time or energy to move elsewhere again to start anew for the nth time. Btw I dont think that tips suggesting hanging with friends or family will work since Im essentially an immigrant all alone in a country other than for his bf, so I dont really have a safety net in a traditional sense and dont want to burden my partner further.

    "We were engaged. He left me for a 19 year old he has been talking to online for the past 3 months They only saw each other in person once at the time, had each other added on Snapchat ever since, but never talked. When the Tokyo Olympics finally started, she posted a story on Snapchat about Brazil losing in a game of volleyball or something, thats what he told me at least. Since him and I always watched the games together when we could, he knew about it and replied to her story making a joke. Theyve been talking ever since. He told her about me and our story, that we were engaged, etc, and she thought it was awesome and asked to follow me on Instagram. I accepted it. She was extremely nice to me in the beginning and also replied extremely fast. After a few days talking on there she asked me for my WhatsApp number. Ill confess that I didnt really want to give her because I barely knew her and I dont like giving my number to random people. But I didnt want to be rude so I ended up giving her my number and we started talking there. After just a little while talking on WhatsApp, she asked me if we wanted to do a video call with her us 3. I thought she was moving way too fast with intimacy with us, but I asked my fiancé if he wanted to and he said it was up to me. I ended up accepting it. It was actually nice and we called once or twice more. Well, so this situation of her being friends with us lasted for about a month, but around the beginning of October I started being suspicious about some things with the two. We used to call every night before I slept Im at GMT3 and hes at GMT5, and he started giving excuses to go to sleep earlier because he was feeling sick, tired, etc, and I believed him. Well, all those times he was ending our call earlier to call her for 3 hours straight. They also called at other times during the day that I never knew about.",
    "No longer actively depressed but now I need help beating the apathy. I think my life has been changed forever by the major depressive episode I had last year. I dont think Ill ever feel quite like that again I hope, but its left me a parting gift. I just dont care about most things anymore. This is positive in some ways  it makes me less of a perfectionist for example good enough is fine and I dont get choked up on the little things as much. However, it is also very very negative in other ways. I will go for several weeks without doing my laundry, wait until the last second to do assignments, wont clean, etc. I have NO sense of urgency or shame, particularly urgency, but still have minor guilt after the fact if someone comments on my slobbishness. Like, if someone was coming over and I had an hour to clean I wouldnt get everything done. Id probably pick up a few things and say Im sorry for the mess and feel guilty afterwards that Im a slob. But it wouldnt make me change, however and that annoys me. I know that I do care that these things are happening, but theres a total disconnect from actually caring enough to do them respectably. For example, I would like to clean my room because I enjoy the look and space of a clean room. I know it makes me feel accomplished when I do. But a bigger part of my brain doesnt mind living in squalor because it is so apathetic to everything. I dont like this about myself. I want to be timely and disciplined but I have a hard time caring and almost 0 motivation though its slowly creeping back in occasionally. I feel this may be a discipline issue but I would also like some sense of motivation or ambition. I get like this with my career goals too. I want to want more for myself, but I dont act on it.",
    "I'm a shift worker and always forget to take my meds and then it turns into a depression spiral of not wanting to look after myself. Tips for building a healthy routine on a rotating roster. I work a rotating roster and my body clock is everywhere, so I dont really have a routine which makes taking my meds at the correct time very difficult. Sometimes Ill have a fleeting moment that Ive forgotten to take them, but my brain quickly dismisses it as if its not important. I dont really know how to explain it. Deep down I know how important it is that I take them, but something stops me from caring. Thus starting the cycle of being chemically imbalanced and feeling unworthy of being mentally well. I essentially need to ingrain it into a routine somehow so I just dont think about it and just take them. Long story short, Im just seeking some tips with building a healthy routine so I can make this work. Theres plenty of advice out there for people who work the 9 to 5 grind, but Im struggling to get some decent advice for someone who sometimes works nights, sometimes works days, weekends etc. Ive tried using phone apps, but theyre mostly catered to 95 workers.",
    "Is it worth trying more anti-depressants? Hey everyone, My depression has been out of control over the last year. Its always been bad, but this was the first year where I woke up nearly every day thinking about suicide. Ive been seeing a therapist for more than a decade and over that time Ive been talked into antidepressants several times. And without fail none of them helped. Prozac, Solexia, Welbutrin, and another Im blanking on all had no positive effect and untenable sexual side effects. This past year I tried Effexor and had to quit after a month or so because it made me feel emotionally numb and I felt no fear or concern about my growing desire to end my life. Now Im very apprehensive about even trying another SSRISNRI As of a few days ago I made one last try at maybe getting the Spravato treatment. But because I live in the worlds richest third world countrythe U. S., all of my prior SSRI experiences mean nothing. The insurance company requires that I endure at least 3 immediate attempts with drugs they want to cover before they even consider honoring the insurance that I pay them for. Has anyone similarly developed this apprehension towards antidepressants and eventually found one that worked? I was given a list of more modern SNRIs and Im fucking terrified that theyll make me feel like he last one and Ill give in and do it.",

    "Too much to handle This quarantine has made the situation pretty much worse, and I really want out, but I dont know whom to go to and seek help from. Ive been a victim of constant gaslighting and emotional abuse my mom believes other third party people more than she believes me, and exhibit A this happened even when I was sexually harrassed by a driving school instructor, from a school SHE put me in. When I question my mother about her incredibly selfish and narcissistic ideals, and pushing me to be what she thinks is human perfection, she just shrugs it off by saying, all humans are selfish, and this is human tendency, and hence my selfishness is justified. I dont know where to go, or what to do, and the worst part is, in the country where I live, youre legally an adult if youre 18, but youre not really an adult, for you dont get a job without graduating, and you definitely dont get affordable houses on rent with the meagre income youd earn as a pink collared employee.

Im constantly berating myself over my past actions and I feel like such a terrible person. Its nobodys fault but my own and I cant go back or start over and I cant handle that. Im crying multiple times a day and my mental state is seriously affecting my studies at uni. I feel like Im never going to be happy again nor do I deserve it. How do I cope?",
    "Nothing is right in my life. I don't know if I can be fixed. I was both abused and neglected starting at about 5 years old. Prior to that I was raised very well, then my parents just took their anger out on me physically and verbally for years until eventually they just told me they gave up on me. I hated myself so much in highschool and would never let girls get close to me and even developed a violent hatred towards them. I became a drug addict, using opiates mixed with other drugs nearly every day to numb how I felt. No one ever caught me and I had to quit on my own. I dont think my brain ever recovered from this either. In the past 2 years Ive stopped enjoying all hobbies. I barely will myself to practice guitar a couple times a week. I cant play video games at all and have maybe put 24 hours into them the last 2 years. I go running everyday because of the endorphins rush but its so incredibly boring and then I remember I have to come back to reality and go to work and be put down by everyone around me. None of the goals I set a year ago excite me. In fact, I live in fear of accomplishing them because I just cant see myself enjoying them. But I changed my mind about what I wanted to do every year before that and I cant afford the time or money I will waste if I change my path yet again. And there is nothing I want to change it to anyways. I have to stick with something for once and the disinterest is killing me. I have physically insecurities that shouldnt bother me but do because Im already in such a fragile mental state. Ive never had a semblance of a relationship or been involved with anyone sexually and the loneliness doesnt help but reinforce my negative image of myself. I have bad genetics and pretty undesirable physical features, so even when Im in good shape Im not much to look at. I used to take pride in my intelligence but I dont have that anymore. My brain has been fried, neglected, and has deteriorated to the point where I may be able to understand complex ideas, but Im slower to process than your average remedial student.",
    "My (24) boyfriend (30) told me having a child is the only point of life and if he found out he was infertile, he would kill himself. He wants to see me pregnant and watch our child go to school and comfort them if they got bullied etc. He wants someone to take care of him when he gets old. Biologically, having a child is the only point of living and so having a child would cure his depression. I asked him what he would do if it turned out he was infertile and he point blank, no hesitation said he would kill himself. So that was extremely scary. I dont know what to do anymore. Ive tried to get him to go to therapy, but he sees absolutely nothing wrong with his worldview and i dont know how to convince him otherwise. Obviously, it is okay if we have to break up because our life paths are different, but honestly, hes done a lot of drugs weightliftingbodybuilding related and there is a very real possibility that hes infertile. I love him to pieces and will be crushed ifwhen we break up, but I dont know what i would do if he killed himself. Does anyone have any ideas for how to show him that the point of life is not only having a child? And yes, i did mention adoption which would provide the same tribe and care for him when hes old that hes so fixated on but he said he didnt want to adopt. Im just really worried and scared right now. Thank you all in advance. TLDR  my boyfriend thinks having a child is the only point to being alive and if he cant have a child he would just kill himself. I dont want a child but i also dont want him to kill himself. Help!",
    "Need help/advide Hi so I need some guidance as I feel very lost at the minute. Ive suffered from anxiety and depression for years now, but when I graduated university last summer things just spiralled out of control to the point where I was put on anti depressants again and my doctor told me I wasnt fit for work. The anti depressants have helped with my depression but my anxiety is still that bad that doing anything but sitting in my room is a massive struggle. A couple of weeks ago my doctor said I should start to be eased in to a job again, but I had a work capability assessment a few days ago and got told that I should take a year of sick pay and focus on getting better, as if I got a job I would likely crash within a few weeks, and this has happened before. Im running out of things to say when friends and family ask if Ive got a job, so this is a nightmare situation especially as the only person whos not a professional who knows is my mum. And its all well and good trying to focus on getting better but Ive been trying for many years now and havent made much progress, recently Ive been trying mindfullness and working out but neither has helped much I also start counselling again next week but this has never helped much either. I want to work, be happy, not be anxious all the time and not feel so alienated from everyone else my age and society in general. What should I do? Has anyone else been in a similar situation and recovered? Can anyone point me in the right direction of something that would help?",

But deep down I always knew I only made all these changes and sought help just so I could tick them off and in my suicide letter write look, I tried all these things and they didnt work so I killed myself instead. Oh, and did I mention that Ive only told my gf and my older sister about, and even that took YEARS this since I feel so embarrased and dont want people to get involved. I read about people all the time saying just muster through, its worth it in the end, or therapy saved my life, or I know it feels dark right now.... But I just cant connect with or believe in that. And I know I sound like an immature spoiled brat in saying so. How does one find the motivation or the will to fight this? I feel like giving up before actually starting the fight. It wont be worth it. I really cant see myself feeling proud, happy or satisfied about myself, or being the person I want to be. I really cant put words to my thoughts and feelings, it all sounds so banal. I know a lot of people feel like this, like no one understands me, it will not work for me, there is no help I can get . I KNOW there is help I can get, although it hasnt for me yet. I KNOW it might get better if I put the time and effort into it. I just dont want to. I want to die.

I only do things if I HAVE to or if Im inspired by a strong emotion. Like if Im angry, Ill do something. But that wont last long. I used to be ambitious. I used to care a lot more. I used to have some sense of passion. Now  I see just how powerless Ive always been and how overall meaningless it is to care so god damn much. I understand I need to be providing others with something of value to get value in return. I understand that the more value I can give, the more value I get. Its just that whatever value I can get in return just doesnt really appeal to me. None of it is incredibly interesting or exciting.

Now that Im a certain age, im expected to function normally but somehow I cant find anything to motivate me. I cant find anything that interests me and drives me to do better. The feeling sucks.

I am falling to pieces and every night when I pass out crying I pray I wont ever wake up. The main trouble is my apartment. Its a one bed tiny place to live but its mine and Ive always loved it. The work I had used to take me away a lot and this has always been my sanctuary. However with everything thats happened and the dip in my mental health it is now disgusting. I havent cleaned in months. I havent done laundry. I havent showered or put sheets on my bed. I literally have no clean utensils or dishes or pans. There is baked on food from months ago and actual mold in my cups. I have taken to hiding under my covers because I am so disgusted with myself. I have a therapist who tells me to take baby steps and one job at a time. But I have done nothing. I am on medication but my motivation doesnt seem to be improving. I am at my wits end trying to know what to do, I have been down before but I have never got as bad as this. I guess Im asking for anyone else that knows how this feels, HOW do I get out of it?

    "How do I (14 M) talk to my (Typical Indian) dad about seeing a therapist? Now I dont know if I should believe him or not. Anyways, this was just the backstory and here is whats going on now I want to see a therapist to talk about my problems but there is no therapist where I live. The closest one is like 3 hours away. One of my closest friends lives in Chandigarh Its a big city and I asked him if he could find out about any therapists there. His mom used to be a dentist so she knew some people and one of her close friends is a reputable psychologist in Fortis hospital. He told me about her and I was like Well, so can I call her and talk to her about wtf is going on with me but turns out she needs to talk to my dad first because since Im a minor I cant be diagnosed without parental consent. So this means that I will have to tell my dad that I need to see a therapist. He will ask me why and I will have to tell him about my depression, suicidal thoughts, etc. Keeping in mind how our last convo about my mental health went and our notsogood relationship, can you guys give me some advice about how to talk to him? PS He gets irritated very easily and he rarely listens to me, and even if he does he will say Im wrong since I am younger and that I never listen to him. TLDR I am a 14 yo Indian dude with a typical Indian dad. Our last convo about my mental health went not so wonderful and he told me to kill myself and how to do it, and that he doesnt give a fuck about it.

I keep falling into this terrible spiral of thoughts like well, you would feel less depressed if only youd exercise, eat healthy and keep the house clean, but of course, living with depression means I rarely have the energy to do all or any of those things. And the more I kick myself, the more energy I lose, so I sit in bed, eat cookies and let messes pile up around me, which in turn makes me more depressed, and so on.... Im on medication and in therapy, both of which help, but I get so down on myself for not being able to form better habits. I know I need to start small and to go easy on myself, but even then its a struggle. At the moment Im more focused on how to deal with the guilt of not doing things, as opposed to strategies for accomplishing said things.

    "\"Paying for happiness\" - anyone else? It is as if my body and mind HAVE to revert back to a depressive norm, like a rubber band snapping back the higher I stray from it, the more intense the snapback. This is devastating, even as I have recognized the pattern and come to expect it. It literally feels like I am punished by my own bodymind for daring to experience happiness or joy. It feels like a cruel trick by the Universe every time, or like I have to pay the piper for not feeling depressed for one damn day. I have considered the possibility of bipolar disorder, but I really dont think thats it. Certainly yoyoing between joy and depression has that weird polarity, but the happiness is always caused by externals  a trip somewhere, quality time with friends, a great experience, etc. It doesnt just come out of nowhere. I really have to find and create the happiness. It is the punishment that has no rhyme or reason aside from following the pattern. It is inevitable even if nothing bad happens to bring me down  its just a crash, like a plane running out of fuel and dropping out of the sky. And while the happiness can feel euphoric sometimes, it doesnt feel like any kind of manic episode Ive heard or read about. It is more just the joy of feeling some goddamn unvarnished happiness for a little while. Does anyone else experience this? Any suggestions? !",
    "Needing Time to Heal But BF doesn’t get it....am I in the wrong? I was involved with a really good, caring man preCovid, long distance. I love him and thought it was going to be permanent one day. We had a good healthy relationship in the past despite being long distance. During Covid, I didnt see him for way over a year. We kept in close contact, daily calls and texts, but my depression took a turn. I started taking different meds and was struggling. I tried to tell him this many times via phone and by text and he would give me tough love type responses such as people have it worse than you or it could be worse or dont worry so much, look how far youve come or things will improve soon with Covid. I felt like he didnt understand and I basically just stopped trying to explain after trying so often and receiving no sort of acknowledgement or empathy from him. I admit I got fed up trying. Then I saw him for the first time in March and it just felt off between us. I was very unwell mentally in my mind, felt like I had a lot going on mentally and I just felt disconnected from him. After the visit, he kept on saying I seemed different and he asked what was going on with me. I ended up telling him again I was struggling with depression, opened up extensively about the details and explained how awful its gotten. I also sent him literature on major depression to try and give him objective info I thought maybe he could learn from. His response was to say I didnt communicate it to him, and then to say he didnt get it over and over. This was irritating but I patiently tried to be fair and hear him out. Then he continued to harp on how he couldnt fix me and he felt bad that he had no way to fix me. I told him I dont wantneed him to fix me, that I have mental illness and he needed to just let me figure it out with my professional medical help, respect that and be patient. So after that, and our weird visit, it felt like he was just making me feel pressure and stress.",

Im this close to ending it all and my therapist will just refuse to let me see the psychiatrist no matter how many times I ask. If I do attempt it will be successful, so its not like Ill have multiple attempts ie. they may give me meds after one. What do I say to get them to think more about giving me them? Theyre so reluctant. I see people complain 247 about how they dish out meds on a platter. But its the opposite for me and there is absolutely no reason. Ive done my research and I know the side affects. But no therapy will work now.",
    "Concerned friend wrote me a letter My best friend wrote me a letter last night. She cleared out her childhood bedroom and we thought it would be fun to read trough old diaries since Im not doing great at the moment. But we eventually read mine too. I forgot how dark my notes were. It was honestly very eye opening but I think reading about my suicidal thoughts, in the current situation concerned her a lot. This morning, she handed me the letter, saying Id have to read it when Im feeling down. She wrote about our friendship, how we give each other the courage to be ourselves, how much Ive helped her, how much she wants to be there for me. I read the letter twice, I cried both times. Now I feel guilty for worrying her. How do I respond?",
    "How can I deal with Bipolar people? Im kind of sick of walking on eggshells around my dad... Hes sick and needs to be under watch, and my mom doesnt have that time while I do, so I chose to stay with him and help around. But its incredibly hard to deal with his mercurial temper  it can change at the drop of a hat! Sometimes all it takes to trigger his rage is a little comment. Im tired, my heart is tired. I cant give up on him because I know its a disease and not really his fault, but Im made of flesh and blood too! Does anyone has a way to deal with these kind of situation? Just sitting and enduring verbal abuse is so, so draining... my usual coping method is to wait until his temper cools down and for him to apologize  but everytime this happens I break a little. Advice please.",
    "Every night just before drifting off to sleep, I'm overwhelmed with feelings of self hate and guilt. It spikes in me just before drifting off to sleep, like I was watching my life in a movie but then I suddenly realize its real and I am overcome with fear, dread, embarrassment, and guilt, like Im driving a train off a bridge or something. Could it be a brain tumor pressing against some part that controls these negative flight reactions? Why am I feeling these things flood into my brain right before drifting to sleep?",
    "Can't find a therapist I can afford I feel like a therapist will really help. I have Beacon insurance and Im realizing, after contacting over 20 therapists, that they dont want to take my insurance because it pays so little. The cheapest therapists are around 60session out of pocket and I cant afford that weekly. I was thinking about seeing if I could get by on one session a month, but would that really help or will I just be losing precious rent and food money? Im distressed about all this...",
    "I’ve never felt so alone. Empty. Things escalated from the last post i made asking for help. Thanks, mike, for responding to it. Before giving an update i will give you some context. Im turning 14 in 5 days, i moved countries 5 times over my life time, at the age of 7 i left from italy to france, 9 to ny, back to france at 10 and then canada, montreal. I dont know how to approach people. I see all my old classmates on social media having their best lives, they have supporting friends, i have none of that. I have no one. I fucking hate my mother and my father that are making me choose who to stay with. Now for the update, i realized i have nothing to do in this world. Court isnt even stressing me anymore, i lost all my emotions. I just want to die, its not worth the effort to keep on living. Im too much of a fucking pussy to kill myself though. I just dont feel loved, im alone all fucking day after school. I have litterally no interests. My dad always critiques me and my mother isnt fucking okay either. I just want help, i dont think i can keep going like this. Read my last post for more context, i was rushing this.",
    "I really need some advice to fix my life.. My social skills were and still are very poor so talking to people thru social media made it easier for me to communicate with others and make some friends so thats what i did and because of that i found some amazing people that i had lots of fun with and kept me distracted from my real life problems. Some of them were momentary but some i still talk to even till this day. My whole life i had to endure family drama from both sides of the family and i had to solve every single problem i had by myself cause i did not want to bring up more problems to my family so i had to mature pretty early on in my life. Fast forward to now i have lost 2 school years because of absences i dont have any REAL friends that i can count on and no one to talk to i spend my whole day in my room with nothing to do, i dont even sit on my computer anymore i just lie on my bed sleeping or thinking,crying. I am working on losing my weight and thankfully that goes pretty well but i still feel like shit and i find no motivation to keep trying or even living. I am very self conscious about my weight and i hate the way i look regardless of the weight, oftentimes i hate myself and i am disgusteddisappointed with what Ive become.. every day that passes these feelings get stronger and stronger i dont know what to do. Now that you know a little bit about me i want to ask for advice because i have no idea what to do or where to start on fixing things.. I feel like i lost interest in everything and i feel like I dont want to live anymore..i feel alone, lost and that no one likesloves me for who i am and those who do do it out of pity or just do it because i am a family member, i dont have anyone close to me that i can talk to because the only close real friend i had started avoiding me and i dont really blame him for that. I am ready to make a change because i want strength to be able to support the people i love and if i dont make a change i fear that even more negative thoughts will get in my head like self harm or worse.",
    "In love with my best friend who doesn’t see me like that. Over the past few years Iv lost many friends to suicide so I know how terrible it is, but lately I really find myself understanding why they did it and tbh I dont have the guts to go through with it. Im really hoping someone can share some advice, I have done therapy and seen doctors but I didnt really find it helped. Its hard to fully open up face to face.",
    "What else can I do? I just turned 36 and feel like my life has passed me by. Relationships are nonexistent in my life, life in general has just gotten progressively worse. I dont know what else to do at this point. This has been a 16 year journey to find freedom from depression with no distinguishable positive results, unfortunately  not even a little bit. Ive followed through to completion with ketamine infusions, 10 different medications for depressionanxietyadhd, neurofeedback biofeedback treatments, Ive seen 8 different therapists, a handful of psychiatrists, life coaches, psychoanalysts. Ive taken psychedelics. Occasionally with a new drug or treatment, I break free momentarily  I feel infinitely less burdened  I feel hope  this usually only lasts a day or at the very, very most a few days... I always, always fall back to where I was again. I force myself out of sheer will to exercise and eat healthy every day, that definitely helps  without that, I would be so much more miserable. But the fog is still there. the selfdefeating thoughts still there  nothing is ever good enough. I still feel so stuck, unmotivated, and deprived of life. I heard of TMS Therapy  I spent the last of my savings on the ketamine infusions so I cant afford them right now, even with insurance. Im terrified it will only work for a bit of time, then Ill have thrown away thousands of more dollars in the process. I am not a quitter.. I have no desire to end my life. I just dont know what is left to do to feel joy in my life, to break free from this once and for all. Is there hope here? I dont know what to do next... Does anybody have suggestions",

    "How do I process a break up with depression and anxiety In April, I 25F blew up on my boyfriend 24M because his communication was extremely poor and he still had his dating apps. I kept mine to spy on him and until he finally deleted his. In November, he ghosted me because I blew up on him for being online on Badoo. we met on My trigger is rejection because I havent seen my father in 21 years. I get hysterical because I relive the abandonment and rejection over again I begged for him to come back and he did 3 weeks later. But, I always took the blame. He claimed that he used it to get weed. Fast forwards to April, the last time I saw him in person he got a notification from Bumble to come back and use the app. He told me he wasnt using it but I lost it and asked to see if he received a message but he wouldnt show me. Then, I asked him to delete all the apps on his phone. He claimed he couldnt get into Badoo because he needed to go through his email to get the password and it would take to long. Then, he didnt message me for over week, he does this all the time to me. He worked nights and it was a long distance relationship. All I wanted was how are you, good morning and good night text. I was always the one initiating the conversations. When i complained he would only communicate for 2 weeks and then stop. Also, he was never been there for me. After this point, I blew up, told him if he couldnt delete the rest of the dating apps and give me more communication or it was over. He never answered me back. Due to my depression trigger, I freaked out. I begged for him back again. He answered and was quiet again so I went to his house but never answered. After that, he stopped messaging me. Its been almost a month. I cannot sleep well even though Im on medication, I get panic attacks, have anxiety all the time about him replying back to me, being alone again, rejection and where my life is heading especially with this virus because I was suppose to move in with him.",

    "My life is amazing, but I'm a miserable asshole. I'm not sure what to do. I have been in quite a few abusive relationships romantic and platonic so I know theres some trauma Im still working through. But the problem is that despite all the progress Ive made and all the wonderful things in my life, I cant feel any of that wonderfulness. I see my wife, I know I love her, I can act on that love, but I cant... feel it. Its just numb. I watch a show that makes me happy, and I just cant... feel that happiness. Its like Im constantly, permanently disconnected from anything positive, and no matter how healthy my habits might become or what attitudes I choose to adopt, neutral is the best I feel about anything. On top of that, its like Ive forgotten how to have fun. I have hobbies that I never pursue. Ill buy something, say a video game, and never play it. I have a pile of books Ive bought but never read, and sadly, its not because Im just too slow at getting through them. Its like, when I try to do something that isnt work, I get these voices not literal in my head screaming you shouldnt be doing this. The more I try to have fun, the worse I feel about it. I mentioned I just graduated college  three years at a community college couldve been 1 12, thanks shitty counselling department! and 2 years at UCSD. I graduated  though there wasnt a ceremony or anything thanks Covid  and felt... nothing. I didnt feel pride, or relief, or anything. It was like Id just finished washing the dishes  okay, thats done, whats next? A couple of years back, I got my black belt in a very difficult martial art after 7 years of training three times a week. The test was a fourhour ordeal that literally involved, at one point, blood streaming down my face as I fought a marine twice my size they paused it for a few minutes so I could clean myself up. When they announced the results a few days later, I didnt feel pride, or accomplishment.",
    "Sometimes the worst part isn't what happened to us but being alone with the pain from what happened to us I spent some money on something helpful for my mom that she very much uses and loves because Im grateful for her help which was what she was talking about and after getting angry at her but expressing it in an unhealthy way I feel like shit. It doesnt feel the same trying to vent online, because I want my female friends that I know and care about and feel a genuine connection with to make me feel heard and listened to, and always starting from zero talking to strangers and trying to provide context about who I am and the dexterity of my mental illness is exhausting. Im a very supportive and helpful person to my said friends when it comes to mental health problems, and having to be on the receiving end and in need of help at inconvenient times just sucks. In the past Ive posted to reddit and people will look at my post history saying you are a very mentally ill person and should get help. And I wish I could just say that most of us mentally ill people dont have to luxury to afford anything that actually can help. And well have to take what little opportunities we can get even if its not ideal or in the least helpful. Lonely people dont have the luxury to choose who can comfort them. I still feel the lump in my throat and ache in my chest from a crisis and breakdown but at least Ive expressed myself",
    "Therapist Reached Out I see a trauma therapist for PTSDCPTSD, and recently I encountered two other traumas which have put me over the edge at times. They know that I havent been doing the greatest while trying to deal with them and that Im continuing to spiral downwards. I usually send a weekly message to my therapist to let them in on the skills Im using and how my week has been. I havent been up for sending messages lately, and I probably scared the crap out of my T last session as I discussed how much I hated having the intense suicidal ideation and how detailed its becoming. I even blew up in their face telling them that they didnt understand how serious I was. I could even hear her start to choke up as rarely do I talk to her in this manner. Today, she sent out a message to let me know how she could help me throughout the week. Im very confused as I have no idea how a therapist can help anyone through the week. I truly appreciate the message of concern, but how can I ask my T for help during the week without it crossing boundaries? I know for sure shes not going to bring me food or allow me to call her, so what does help look like as I know I could use some?",
    "Everything I used to enjoy feels like work now. What can I do? I just feel so anxious and filled with existensial dread. I want to enjoy the things I used to enjoy before like video games but literally anything that takes some kind of effort feels like a lot of work. So instead I just lay in bed on my phone and waste my life away I feel so horrible. Before I coud get into video games and enjoy the challenge but now I just feel extremely frustrated and just want to try to finish it as soon as possible which takes the fun away.

    "What do you do when everything makes you depressed? I literally cannot do anything anymore without becoming sad while doing it. I hate my job so that makes me depressed, I go to the gym everyday but I always end up hating myself by then end because everyone there is more attractive and fitter then me and ill always be ugly and fat and no one will love me, I go home to do homework and I end up depressed because I hate school, then I try to take my mind off things by playing a video game, watching a movie, or listening to music but even then I become depressed because I start to think about what a piece off garbage I am because I could never create anything like the things im enjoying. I cant hang out with my friends because eventually, they piss me off because while I love them to death, they can become very annoying and make me angry. I cant really meet new people because I am so afraid that people will not like me that I do not even try, which also screws up my dating life as well. But because of this isolation I put myself through, im very lonely. I used to hang out with a girl that did not make me sad but we are not on good terms anymore so I really have nothing to get me through the days anymore. The only thing keeping me from ending my life is that I do not want my death to be a burden on others, it feels selfish. I really do not know what to do anymore that can make me happy and it scares me so if anyone has any advice of any kind, I will take whatever you got.",
    "Staying POSITIVE is ALREADY hard and now I am the caregiver to a SUICIDAL FRIEND Hi guys, I dont know if this is the right forum for my overall mixed content. Im 23 F. And I need some advice on my situation. Appreciate it if yall could share with me your thoughts. To start off, I have both anxiety and depression. I know that with those 2, it definitely would be a roller coaster ride with my emotions and I am familiar with this as it is like a cycle that I kept having to go through. I would say that my depression is not as severe as my anxiety though. So back to my main story. Recently I have been busy trying to help a suicidal friend. I have known her for 7 years plus and am aware that she was suffering from depression. I always thought that it was going to be okay as time goes by but then I realized it worsened. She was really going all out on ending her life that I had to call the police on her. Thing is, she has been planning out her will and settling whatever she considered as necessity for the preparation of her demise. Its like i am scared but I have no choice to take charge as she does not have a good rs with her family. I managed to persuade her to go and seek help from the professional. She was adamant but somehow agreed eventually. First medication didnt work so we changed to another type. End up, she decided to stop taking the medication all by herself. She went MIA for about a week or so. When she finally texted, it was bad news  she was prepping to end her life. I had to call the police on her. Apparently she lied to them that she was okay and would be attending her appointment, so they couldnt do anything in my country the police can only intervene if you are caught in the act of committing suicide. However later on she berated me as she felt that I had betrayed her. She however continued to confide in me. I was pretty much unsure what to do so I wrote a letter to the family secretly I know where she stays and i made sure to text her mum that I had put a letter outside their house gate.",
    "I feel like I have no reason to be alive after I saw a movie I was looking forward to. Ok I know it sounds dumb but I only get through life because I have things to look forward to, usually Im looking forward to movies or TV shows.

I try to look forward to other stuff but I dont really feel that excited for the stuff coming out.",

To this day, I cant ever get any medication for it either, but I save that little later. ampx200B By 12th grade, my grandfather had passed away, and he was the only thing I had to father like. My depression hits me harder and I just no longer had any desire for school. I begin skipping so much school that I was dropped from the program. I only stayed home, watch t.v and played video games. I get a job and I stayed there for five years. Naturally I find other work over time and keep going with jobs I hate. I move in with my mother at some point, I thought it be a good idea and grow closer to her. ampx200B My mother goes on to lie and steal from me the entire time Im with her. I had even tried to go back to school and get my GED but told down a lot. I pay money for something, and they would pocket it. I would sleep, and they steal my credit card and spend my entire paychecks. I was often treated like a third class citizen while living with them. ampx200B While attending GED school, it a massive struggle for me. I cant focus longer than 30 minutes and only a few times a week if that. I still have no medication to get back on or a way to get them. To this day, Im quite afraid to ever try for it, in thinking Im making it up, you last this long why now you need them. So yeah, I dont ever get it and it alwaysjust something I hate myself for. I just feel like Im lazy and crap because I cant focus on. I did end up getting half of the credits credit for GED, where I am at you dont have to take all the test at once. You can take each test one at a time. Im only needing math and science which both I have a tough time focusing on. Both take the longest to learn and hardest for me to stay still for. ampx200B At some point, I grow homeless and then move into with a relative and then kicked out after getting a bunch of money from me.",

I have a neurological disorder that causes chronic pain and muscle spasms, and I feel like its deteriorating my normal level of function. I have considered myself highfunctioning for a long time. Ive been in and out of therapy currently out for years, but its never been helpful. Therapists have told me I seem very selfaware, but that Im closed off. Its a struggle to talk to anyone about anything personal, especially if its negative. So this is really hard for me, to post like this. Im hoping the anonymity of the internet makes it easier.

I grew up being very neglected, experienced all forms of abuse, and ended up leaving home at 16. I have struggled to finish school and have never managed to complete anything after highschool. I still struggle with PTSD and mental health issues.

    "Feeling at the end of the line I didnt confront the issue till I was 24 and a girlfriend that I used to talk to and sort of wanted something more were talking about our feelings and I just plained told her what had happened to me and she told me that something similar happened to her at a similar age, we cried and talked about it and other things, strangely even as we felt closer after this we went our separate ways being just good friends to this day she is married, lives in a different country and has a baby, after that I worked through my trauma alone with little success side note, there is a history of violent tendencies in the men of my family, both from my mothers and fathers side, and Im basically the mixed result. A couple years later I met my first long relationship girlfriend and as you can imagine I fell hard for her and spoiled her like crazy, she helped my reconnect with my father and I told her about my trauma and to my surprise she also was a victim, we both tried to get professional help within our means but only I got serious about it and kept going to my sessions, she said she was fine on her own and knowing how hard this was I let her take her own choice and just tried to be supportive when needed, needless to say it ended bad, near the end when we were about to move in together I tried to start a conversation about how we began getting together and how special she was to me, apparently I was the only one that felt that way because she told me that the only reason she kissed me and begun hanging out with me was because she felt pity for me, we had other issues like a poor sexual life and not enough time on her part for us, so after she told me about how we really had begun our relationship I felt numbed and after a few days in emotional hell I broke up with her, I listed all that was wrong with the relationship and told her that something that begins with pity cant have a future, I wasnt able to tell her that that was what hurt me the must, she never apologized and we went our separate ways, her family loved me and knew I was the good guy and I was the best for her and tried to help but never went passed of a small conversation with me, they were harder on her but in the end they are her family, I found out she also cheated later on and it was what killed the last pieces of love I had for her, I didnt confront her about it and we never spoke ever again, the pity confession destroyed my self confidence we were together for close to 4 years.",
    "How to tell my parents I think I’m depressed? So, Im a 15 year old boy, and I truly believe I am depressed. I have looked at symptoms online and have thought about them and I do have some of them at least I think so,and I at least want to get help and find out if Ive just been sad or truly depressed. However, I dont know how to tell my parents that I think I might be depressed. So, a little backstory. My grades have been slipping this year, and Im working hard to get them back up, but Im worried that if I say something about my feelings now, my mom will think its an excuse for my bad grades which it isnt, i should have been able to keep up with my classes. I also dont think she will believe me. I dont think I can actually convince her to let me get a diagnosis. If any of you guys have ideas on how to tell my parents, Id love to hear. Heres what Ive been thinking of doing sitting them down, telling them Im not joking with what Im about to say, and tell them how Im feeling. But again, I dont think my mom will believe no matter how hard I insist that I want help. So to reiterate, any ideas you guys may have on this are appreciated, and I want to hear your ideas.",

    "I’m tired of pushing forward. Hello all. This is my first time trying to reach out for help and doing so with friends and family feels shameful because I am my familys rock and support system. Its never been the other way around and the few times I asked for some help from my wife its always ended badly. I am 27 Male with a wife who is 28 and a son who is 3. When I met my wife I was already depressed, though never clinically diagnosed. All the signs were there though. Always tired, no motivation, indulging in vices just to feel something. I had no purpose and in all honesty I never ended it because it would be more trouble than it was worth. My mother and sister would be hurt and financially strained from my sudden death so I just lived day in and day out trying to not to sink too low. They were my excuse to live. After meeting my wife things because brighter. My family definitely noticed an improvement in my attitude and I started taking care of my self more. For a while we only hung out, nothing official yet so I wanted to put my best self forward in hopes of building a relationship with this amazing woman. A year later we married and she got pregnant. It was my sons birth that pushed me to go back to school and get a better job. Simply put my finances would not be able to sustain a decent life style. Ive noticed though that slowly over the years Ive started to fall back into the same depressed state of mind. I am unbelievably tired all the time, I have started buying more alcohol than normal and spending more and more time playing online games in hopes of getting some moments or happiness in a day of glum. My wife has noticed and started complaining that Im changing for the worse. I can see it but I just cant seem to do anything about it. I have moments of motivation where I will be good for a couple days but then revert back. Recently I had a bad episode where I just started drinking and wallowing in self pity. My son was already asleep so he wasnt exposed to it. When my wife came home she seemed concerned but didnt really know how to react.",
    "I'm losing my mind and need help. I contemplate suicide everyday. I don't see any future anymore, just think I'll kill myself one of these days. I need help. 17 year old male, 18 beginning of July. Ive been struggling with my mental health for all of my life, and it got worse after starting puberty. Ive always been terrible with social groups and interactions. Never managed to make a lot of friends, and those I did never sticked. Had some of your regular trauma from parents and older brother. Ive always felt alone. When I became a teenager I started with the depression. Got very bad episodes, where I would shut down, and fake illness so I could stay home. I missed one month of school once, and on a trip to Italy for school I faked illness for two weeks so I could stay in bed, and could only think about jumping off a bridge. As I got deeper into adolescence not only did my mental health deteriorate, but my ability too. My memory became poor, and my focus was gone, always having mental fog. I couldnt remember words, and speak eloquently. Math ability went to the shitter, always making stupid mistakes that would then seem retarded later. My IQ seemed to have dropped as much as 10 points, since I have periodically been applied tests and only perform worse. Starting high school made me much more suicidal because of this, and the isolation of not knowing anyone, and the people I did know wouldnt even look me in the eyes. I had already gone to a psychologist, and after that a neurologist, and recently a therapist. Got medication, and have been on it since 2017. The doctor has changed my meds more times than I can count, and none of them have helped. She told me that I would probably never be off of meds, but they still dont help me. I have no cure. I feel I have been slowly getting worse, going down my own dark little hole. Ive always been obsessive, but now it feels like its all I am. I feel like Im losing my mind. Everything makes me irritated, or break down.",
    "How in the actual heck does one love themselves I have a very bad problem in that the only way to love myself is that I receive love from other people a potential girlfriend. This is apparently very unhealthy and self destructive. Problem is, that is all I know about how to love myself. I have been told to love myself but I find that VERY difficult to do. I was raised in a household with a mother who was infuriated and enraged with seemingly small things and took things way too far pretty frequently. She took a lot of her anger out on my father and she did so in plain sight of me and my sister. Her use of pure hatred and rage towards my father rubbed off onto me. The difference is, that unlike her, I have the common decency to keep all this inside my head. A lot is directed towards the outer world and a lot is directed towards myself. I cant love myself, because the only two things I feel for myself are hatred and rage, so I look to unspoiled minds for affection. I know this is self destructive and it will just push me closer to pulling the trigger or jumping off the cliff, I know that. ampx200B I am looking for real, tangible, practical and usable advice for how to love oneself. The only advice I have received so far is that, You should love yourself. Great, what the heck does that mean? I have received advice like, Engage in your hobbies and court yourself. Well I already have hobbies and I do nice things every once and a while, no effect there. Plus, I dont have much time to engage in hobbies since I am a college student and despite having some money in the bank, I need to make more this summer. ampx200B If you have any advice, it would be greatly appreciated.",
    "Am I pathetic? I moved 1,000 miles away from my hometown to live with my boyfriend a year ago and Ive been miserable since. I love my boyfriend with everything in me, but I have a very, very close relationship with my family and the distance is killing me. I practically raised my sister theres a 10 year age gap, so I feel like I abandoned my child or something, even though shes old enough to be more of my friend now. I miss living in a very small town I live in Miami now, and just being close to everyone. My relationships with my family are slipping and it makes me hate my life. My boyfriend refuses to live anywhere that isnt urban especially somewhere as rural and uncultured as my home, and theres no cities within a 4 hour distance from my hometown, which wouldnt help at all. Idk what to do, I cant imagine my life without my boyfriend, but I cant imagine living like this without my family near me for much long either. Am I pathetic for being so close to my family and not having the strength to put effort into building a life separate from them? I just see so many people who live close to their parentssiblings even my boyfriend and get soooo jealous, but every advice subreddit seems to think Im being unreasonable and not trying hard enough to live here.",
    "Nothing, and I mean NOTHING helps Do you know whats worse than being depressed and not having your life in order? Being depressed and having your life in order, because if your life is already in order, there is nothing you can improve on and nothing you can do to try and get better meaning there is no hope. My life used to be a mess, but at least I had something to fall back onto. When I told people about my depression, they told me about all the things that helped them out like exercising, extracurricular activities, going out with friends, having good grades, eating well, etc. As someone that couldnt even get out of bed to take a shit, I listened to what everyone told me and did it all. I became an A studentathlete, Im not too good socially but I have a few friends that I talk to and occasionally hang out with, and I lost a lot of weight, but the entire time, I couldnt shake this feeling that everything was off. Theoretically, I should be happy right now, I have become something that I thought was impossible 2 years ago, but it has become clear by now that no matter what I do, I will still want to kill myself. I mean, I feel the same, if not worse than I did 2 years ago. I still stare at my dads pistol every time I walk past it in its case, I still think about cutting myself every time I see a blade. One single thing Ive noticed that has been with me since I was like 7, is that the thought of death is the only thing that brings me comfort in tough times. At this point, I feel like it wont be too long until that thought finally becomes reality.",

    "I don’t think it’s that bad I dont know if this is the best place to post this, but I do need help. Im sorry that its so long. Im also sorry for the bad English, it isnt my native language. Some background info I dont think Im super depressed, but my friends are convinced that I am. I made a plan to kill myself, but havent followed through yet. I have previously promised to tell my friends if I made new plans to kill myself, which I did. Now, they want me to get hospitalised so that I can get help, but the psych ward hasnt helped me before. The stuff I need help with I promised to get help yesterday, but I no longer believe I need much help. They wont let me rescind my promise, and I desperately dont want to break it. I am fairly certain Im not depressed. Even though Ive attempted suicide a couple of times, I have ended the attempts on my own before getting hurt. My question is should I listen to them and go to the psych ward, or am I justified in believing I can manage on my own? Thanks in advance.",
    "Experiencing sadness like never before So lately Ive been feeling really sad and really down, Id say its a mix of losing touch with someone I loved and that made me feel special, starting uni and just the whole covid situation not allowing me to be around friends for a while. Every so often, almost daily, I get really sad at night, I start thinking about all I lost and about all I cant have right now, regarding friends, I lose motivation for anything, dont wanna get up but also dont wanna stay in bed doing nothing, I just cant do anything and I have to force myself to go to uni and sketch a smile on my face so I dont worry the friends I made there. Its getting to the point where Id say its unliveble to have this feeling everyday, but I feel like I cant do anything about it, doesnt feel like my choice to be sad or happy anymore. If theres anything you guys would suggest to try and brighten up my mood Id love some help. Thanks in advance.",
    "I want to slit my wrists but I know the consequences. So basically at the beginning of the year I started slitting my wrist because I started feeling overwhelming depression after 2019. My mum saw the marks and told me to stop. At the beginning of quarantine my depression took another increase, and for two days I started slitting my wrist again until my mum saw. She demanded that I tell her what was wrong, and I just told her I feel generally depressed all the reasoning behind it is complicated and plus I dont feel comfortable telling her. She asked me if a boyfriend had broken up with me or something, and that definitely wasnt the reason so I assume if she knows Im depressed shell think that. She then demanded that I dont slit my wrists again, and therefore I know that if I do, Ill get into a bunch of crap I dont wanna be in. I really wanna start doing it again Im a horrible person so I deserve it and hurting myself makes me feel better for some reason. Ive always felt guilt and shame, and self hatred, and I feel like my life has reached the end of the line I feel true happiness has faded, and the realisation has struck, that life is completely worthless and I will die one day, leaving everything behind. All motivation seems gone, and my life has just gone to shit, comparing it to the past. I really want to slit my wrist, but I know my parents would see. So what do I do? How do I cut myself and get away with it? Can I cover it up without raising suspicion? I really want to. I feel desperate, but I know I cant.",
    "I'm so close to giving up Im so close to giving up on everything. For the last two weeks my mind has been in shit because someone I cared about betrayed me. They did something which could ruin my life and has given me severe trust issues for the foreseeable future. Because of this Ive started losing interest in every I used to enjoy. I used to love going to training but Im beginning to think whats the point. As well my mind is starting to become self destructive. So many times these last 2 weeks, I havent been able to look at myself in a mirror without saying something I hate about myself. Its brought me so close to the edge of hurting myself and Im beginning to lose it. I just want to have some I can trust and care about. But Im getting so paranoid that everyone I like and know just hates me. Its gotten to the stage where im talking to people I like, and Im over analyzing everything they say, thinking theyre just saying it out of pity for me. I just want someone, anyone to care about me. But I know no one ever will. Im starting to think that theres no point in existing since no one would miss me if Im gone.

    "I am sad, alone and scared. Ive never been properly diagnosed with depression but I am currently feeling very depressed. A few years ago when I was younger amp my parents were going through a divorce I was severely miserable, would have large bouts of anxiety amp often contemplated ending my life. It was a sad time in my life but I am glad to say that I got through it and have been doing great for the most part and have hardly felt anxious since. However recently I have been feeling really down amp depressed. All I want to do is sleep and I eat because I am sad and bored, and then I become sad because I eat too much. I have gained weight and am so insecure. I have been skipping my uni classes because I have no friends there and my degree is hard and it all makes me so sad. With all my friends heading in different directions I just feel so alone. I think my family have noticed and say things that are kind of cruel, but I know they mean well. They think I have obsessive compulsive tendencies because I tend to pick at my face often amp struggle to stop. I just dont want to let anyone down amp I am afraid to take the steps to become better because I know it will disappoint my family if I decide to leave uni for example. But most importantly Im scared of going back to how I was years ago, I never want to feel that way again. Ive never reached out for professional help either and dont have the money for therapy. Part of me would feel also ashamed in a way if I got professional help. I hate the idea that something may actually be wrong with me, and I hate the idea of having to take meds. I just feel so lost and conflicted. I feel like I know what I need to do but its so hard to do it and remain consistent. If anyone has any advice at all it would greatly appreciated. Also, thank you if you read through it all.",
    "Weed and depression I started smoking marijuana at the age of 15 at first it seemed like the best thing in the world, but as time went on, my anxiety started to dominate in my life, causing me today to have depression. Nowadays I cant stop smoking marijuana because my friends are always smoking and it is inevitable not to smoke, every time I smoke I feel like its a bad trip I get stuck in my thoughts, judging myself, creating impossible situations to happen and I cant get out. last week i was having suicidal thoughts worst of all i dont want to kill myself but i cant stand the suffering anymore and every time i smoke i feel those same thoughts, im afraid ill never be able to smoke marijuana again since I miss the trips that I had in the beginning.

It started with just the binge eating part, but then i started neglecting my hygiene again, not showering, not leaving my house, ignoring everyone.. Started oversleeping and eating like crapnot exercising made me feel awful physically and very worn out.

    "I suffer from persistent depression and my GF wants to leave me. Last night she told me she did not see a future for us in that way. My sombreness, some of my anxiety fueled behaviour and display of a victim mentality hurt her and have crossed certain boundaries. She meant to tell me this before, even left some breadcrumbs via text. I only noticed her pulling away, losing interest or giving me the silent treatment. I could have guessed this was on her mind but maybe I was to scared to have a talk. I feel sad that she has been dealing with this for a while and how difficult that must have been. She told me that shed given me the benefit of the doubt a couple of weeks ago but never mentioned this to me like so. I do feel her way of going about this, her communication could have been better. But then again this must have been difficult and she told me that it felt like abandoning me. I am so caught up in my current mental state that I have trouble going about things. Like litterarly doing anything some days or going somewhere on time is hard, and I hate that! Dealing with my thoughts, anxiety and all that other crap made lose myself my self worth and the man I wanted to be. But ive crossed her boundaries and I completely understand why she did not want this situation anymore. She told me she still loves me and does not want to give up on me. She recognises this is my situation and that I am not the guy she fell in love with right now. She needs some time to find herself and I need to get a grip on my situation.. I want to improve my communication and our communication. I want to manage my outbursts better. I want to manage my anxiety better. I want to regain my self confidence and self worth. I want to stop this victim mentality, I hate it! I want to regain trust and to reconnect. I could really use some advice and would love to have your input or experiences.

Im a filthy person. I just throw my stuff around without even thinking it and by the time i notice it I feel too overwhelmed to clean. Another thing I struggle with is my dental hygiene. I keep forgetting to brush my teeth, and when I do remember I dread it and try to avoid it. I know its kinda childish but I hate the taste of toothpaste and struggle with focusing on it, even though it only takes two minutes. If anyone can give any advice on how to get these habits under control Id greatly appreciate it. Ive been struggling with both of these for all of my life.

    "Years of worsening chronic fatigue/fog continue to cripple my life Caffeine in any form doesnt help either. Ive seen 3 different psychologists, all of whom were baffled and said they did not know how to help me and have never heard of this before relative to mental health issues.

I feel drunkdrugged, especially as the day progresses. Come 8 PM, I feel so spaced out, the fatigue is unbearable. Sometimes, I feel so tired I feel physically ill. The gradual cognitive decline is shocking Concentration, alertness, memory, focus, processingrecallingstumbling over words and sentences, confusion, etc.. My motor skills have also declined badly as well. I bump into things, my reflexes are awful, I miss things when I try and grab them, etc. I feel dizzylightheaded when I stand up after sitting or laying down. I now have very low arousal. Its almost impossible to startle me. Its like my body doesnt even process loud noises or scare anymore. I feel anxiousstressedoverwhelmed more easily.

My dad is working, my mom is pretty quiet, they both go to sleep before 9pm, and my house is pretty far away from the city no buses, and I dont drive so nowhere I can go.

    "Death anxiety got me feeling like life is pointless and exhausting and it's all a nightmare. Hello! So iv been depressed and anxious for a long time i think but recently i started having thoughts about death every single day and its like i opened pandoras box. Death is so final, so scary. It makes life seem pointless, why build something up when its just a matter of time before it all ends and how am i supposed to enjoy this experience with a metaphorical gun to my head that i dont know when it will go off? I tried looking at spirituality and stuff because nobody knows what happens when you die right? But it seems logical that we just die and the other stuff is wishful thinking... and even if there were an afterlife that would kinda subtract from the meaning of living this one. This is one big bad boogieman that no adult can come and safe me from and its horrible.... So today and yesterday i started having more thoughts about dying, yesterday i went snorkeling and had to quit because i kept thinking about drowning and how that would suck. Today i thought that i might as well die now since nothing matters and its an inevitability and im tired of fighting. But they are thoughts and i feel some distance between me and the action. I still rationally think that i might as well try everything, try to get better.",
    "Losing all hope Ive always struggled with depression, anxiety, alcohol abuse, and body image issues. Ive not had an easy go but always tried hard to better myself and get well. I got sober 1.5 years ago, am in therapy, regularly practice yoga and meditation, take antidepressants, get plenty of sleep, eat well, the whole fucking thing. I have a wonderful supportive husband whom I love, and with whom I had looked forward to building a life and having a family. And yet my depression still remains. In the last year, I have studied philosophy and spirituality and religion and cosmology and neuroscience and evolution and the more I learn the more I am convinced there is no benevolent god, the universe is random and absurd, and life is essentially meaningless. There may have been a creator entity, but its far removed from humanity. I recently watched True Detective and the main character says, I think human consciousness is a tragic misstep in evolution. We became too selfaware. Nature created an aspect of nature separate from itself. We are creatures that should not exist by natural law. We are things that labor under the illusion of having a self, this accretion of sensory experience and feelings, programmed with total assurance that we are each somebody, when in fact everybodys nobody. I agree with this statement entirely and had never heard anyone say it so succinctly. I have felt an urge to try and find some meaning in the world and in my life, that maybe I could climb out of the hole of depression someday, in many ways because of my husband. Until now. My husband is leaving me. He just started his dream job a few months ago, and hes suddenly decided he wants that more than me. That he wants to throw his whole life into work, and doesnt want to be married, or have a family, anymore. Note He is not leaving because I am depressed  he is leaving because he doesnt think he can be a good husband for me while he does this job, and this job is more important to him than I am. This pain...its just not bearable. It cuts to the heart in a way that is not describable.",

    "My mother and I had an unsettling conversation in the midst of my depression, and I don't know how to feel... Okay, so I am teen 14M who is dealing with a lot of struggles. I have had depression for months, and I dont know what to do. I live in a smal part of a big town, which means I dont see many friends often, and Im the only one my age in that part of town. Thats bad from a start, but thats not whats triggering me... I had been dealing with my dumbass psycho ex, not able to see my gf, being bullied and cyberbullied. I have beaten myself until I bled, every day in the past 2 weeks, and I always wonder if life is worth living, and yet I still try to piece things together again. Yesterday, I had figured out that my past was a lot worse than I had originally thought, with reoccurring memories of childhood trauma. We were having a normal conversation about how I was doing at school as usual, but it took a turn quickly back to the worst childhood memories I had, which all I had forgotten until then. I had thought it was always peaceful back then since almost every childhood memory I had before then was happy. I even bring up these positive memories whenever Im down. And these memories came back. Heres what they were one by one in the order they happened The first memory, the only one I couldnt regain my perception on was one from when I was in preschool obviously. The last day I went to preschool, my mother was watching in the preschool because she noticed things werent perfectly fine there. Before it was over, a little girl who was 3 years of age, opened one of the metal doors and accidentally slammed her fingers in the doors. The tips of 3 of that girls fingers were cut off from that door and was bleeding everywhere. The staff was panicking, but they werent doing anything. They didnt call for help. They just stood and watched. The staff, also, were both 17 yearolds watching over 32 preschool kids which was illegal. My mother quickly took me out of that daycare and felt so bad for leaving me there.",

    "26. Depressed, socially anxious, lost and suicidal. I spent most of the money I made with my dad on weed. This is how life was for about 8 years. Around 2013 i began taking lexapro and took it until Feb 2019 but it didnt really help. My oldest brother ended up overdosing form heroin 4 years after I graduated high school. I had a moment where i said to myself enough is enough, stop smoking, get your shit together and do something with your life but that was short lived. A year after that we moved to Florida. This move didnt really fuck me up as much as the first one but it did affect me a little as I do not like change in general. My drinking increased since I moved down here and I smoked just as much. Fast forward to November 2019. I turned 26 and holy shit it hit me like a ton of bricks. I had a huge quarter life crisis and realized that the past decade of my life flew by so fast and I spent it doing absolutely nothing. I stopped smoking and stopped drinking after doing both habitually for at least a decade. I told myself I could not live like that anymore and if I didnt make a change sooner of later I would look back a decade from now and have the same regrets. I began considering joining the service but honestly had no clue what I wanted to do for a career and I still dont. I just felt like doing anything has to be better than doing nothing and it might help me out of my socially anxious depressed bubble that I am in. Unfortunately around mid November I began suffering from severe dry eye which i am still dealing with as i type this. It has cost me an insane amount of money in doctors visits and i still havent gotten better. I had lasik 4 years ago and it might be the cause dont get lasik. This only has made me more depressed and suicidal. I also went to a cheap therapist for about a month during this time. I also went to a psychiatrist and took Zoloft for about a month and a half without any improvement and stopped because of fear that it would make my dry eye worse. One of the only positive things that has happened recently is I began talking to a girl i met on a dating site.",
    "What to do in the mornings? I am renovating part of my house but its soul sucking work for me with no real deadline. After I get the house finished I wont have anything to do. I feel lost and alone with painful memories as I do this depressing work. If I could stop remembering the pain from the past then I could probably function much better. I just keep finding myself dwelling on negativity. How can I stop? Thanks for reading this. I wish all the best for everyone.",
    "Depression, anxiety and panic disorder(IBS as a bonus), dont know for how long i can take this shit. So i am 22, been anxious and depressed for many years but somehow managed to survive school, but after 11 months of working IBS hit me hard. Had to stop working because i just couldnt leave the house. That was almost 2 years ago, now i still cant leave house without taking good amount of benzos, i am non stop depressed and anxious and thanks to the IBS i have developed a panic disorder. I have tried everything that doctors could think of for the IBS itself but no luck. And for the mental problems, i have tried taking three types of SSRIs, SNRI, TCA and antipsychoticsin special dose to act like antianxiety meds and every one of them made me feel worse, one of them totaly broke me for two weeks. Tried therapy for months. And have been hospitalized for 10 days at psychiatric unit and left because i felt much worse there. So i thought i just need more time to fight this, so i tried get money from the states safety net for living with disability. They acknowledged that i cant function and cant have social life but told me that i can work just fine, so big fuck you to my face 34 of income taxes really pays off.... Now i got work that i can do from home but cant really do it, i have no motivation, no joy from learning it or finishing a project only stress from the huge struggle and probably going to lose the job in a few days. I just dont know what to do, feeling worse than ever, going to be jobless. Should i try another antidepressants even thought i am scared because of the previous bad side effects? I am really desperate. Any advice is really appreciated.",
    "Am I a disappointment?? So, Ive been on tinder for some time now. I have match with several girls and had a conversation with only 2. Each one Ive talked, it seemed like that they might have an interest in me, but that may be the desperation in me since Ive never had a date or girlfriend in my 21 years of existence. After some time passes, they both just completely stop talking to me like I dont exist. I feel like once they stop talking to me, they think Im just another random person. All I want is one girl to date and do stuff with. Im not trying to get into their pants. I personally think that Im a huge disappointment, even tho I have a lot of potential in life.",
    "I need someone This is the first time Im posting and I really need help with how I feel. Im 16 I dont feel needed by anyone,Im depressed and I just want to kill myself. My friends are always doing other things so I never get to talk to them every girl Ive talked doesnt seem to care about me they always ghost me every time I think Im getting close. I dont know what Im even trying to convey to you I just want to be needed by someone,appreciated by someone and loved by someone is there anyone who understands and can help",
    "Staying POSITIVE is ALREADY hard and now I am the caregiver to a SUICIDAL FRIEND I am so exhausted already but yet this happened?? It felt like the mum is just giving up on her daughter?? I fr am so lost on what i should do. Becos tbh, Im also slowly going back into depression and some of my friends has been trying to contact me but I am trying to get away from everyone. I know im burntout but i really feel like shit. I am jobless and im trying to move on with my life but i have to be on my toes in case my friend kills herself. FYI i have since stopped seeing my therapist becos i wanted to focus fully on this friend. I also have called different hotlines available online but lets be real  they kept telling me to call the police when she is in danger. Like I want to know what else I can do yknow. Not like just sit there and wait for her to act on it. I rather understand how I can communicate and try to deflect negative feelings when Im dealing with her. And yet her mum says this kind of things??? Was I at fault?? Was i wrong??? So im begging yall, pls lmk what i can do. Thanks in advance!",
    "Please help me She the new GP knows that I am diagnosed with two chronic painful diseases but she refused to give me any painkillers because just a paracetamol should be enough. I still need to wait a whole month to be able to visit my gyn, the only person that seems to care about my pain. So I am at home with no painkillers, in daily pain and so weak that folding the laundry makes me pant from the effort. I kept going to the same therapist but she is clearly not prepared to deal with chronic pain. I told her three times that i have daily suicidal thoughts and she just changes topic, she wont adress it. Also she gives me stupid advice that is incompatible with my diseases. In our last session she told me that I should consider working as a gardener again. How? Doing basic housechores is a nightmare for me, how I am suposed to do an incredibly physical job???? I am not going back... Then its the issue with my money. As I didnt had a job except the few months gardening in three years I barely have any money left I spent my savings doing a Master before coming ti Belgium. I cant sustain myself and I am compeltely dependent on my partner. I tried aplying for disability but as a migrant not only I dont have any right to get help but the social worker told me that if I dont find a job in two years when my status is reviewed I will likely be kicked out of Belgium. I will become a homeless person. To apply for any help in Spain I just need to work 12 months.... And then there is the issue with my partner. He loves me and tries to suport me. But he really doesnt want to hear about my pain or depression, I cant talk to him about anything that worries me. He simply doesnt care. He also refuses to do any house chores. He forces his SICK girlfriend to do all housechores walking the dog, cleaning, cooking, laundry, gardening, garbage.... He doesnt care that I am in pain or sick, he will simply not help me.",
    "I depress my partner... My partner and I have been together for 11 years now. Were very much alike and most times, thats great. Except for one. We both suffer from depression. Different reasons sprouting from different childhood crap, but the end result is the same both of us lying in bed for a few days under the covers. The problem is, I think my partner is an emotional sponge, because it almost ALWAYS works out that I get depressed first and then he will too, just two days behind. Its gotten to the point that Im getting really intense anxiety over getting depressed myself because I dont want to do that to him. It feels like something Im inflicting on him and then leaving him out to dry cuz Im still screwed up. Im there for him when hes depressed, no question. But anyone who has had depression knows youre not 100 when in the middle of it, and it seems so unfair to me that hes the strong one for me but then doesnt get the same level of help when he goes under. Its like I get someone to lean on but then he only gets someone to wallow with. He says thats all he wants, just some company and reassurance. But its hard to really hear that I was raised by narcissists and its still hard to really accept that I dont have to be on top ofam not to blame for other peoples emotional state. I just want some advice on how to better deal with the anxious thoughts surrounding this so I dont feel like its something Im putting him through, or maybe just some general ideas of how to better be there for him when Im depressed too. The best Ive come up with is focusing on the fact that we always make it out the other side together, but this anxiety is really getting the best of me this time.",
    "I need help While in the bootcamp, we rarely talked, living our separate lives. After I graduated bootcamp I moved to Washington State, to gain some world experience and she did the same thing, but interning in the Caribbean as a marine biology instructor. I started at this time having extremely unhealthy night terrors. I was still madly in love with her, I had a ring in mind from our first relationship and one night was exceedingly bad. The next morning I told myself that I would reach out to her, tell her the truth of what I was feeling. So I did. I told her about how much I missed her, my night terrors, why we separated and my insecurities about how she was feeling at the time. And I told her that I still loved her and either needed her in my life or I had to completely cut her out because my mental health was really bad. These night terrors are demons like no other. I hop no one has to be afraid to sleep because they may experience watching and hearing their ex get railed by guy after guy. It truly is a haunting experience. After I reached out she told me she had missed me, and felt the same. We talked about what things would be different and how we would be able to go on from there. She had 2 months left in her internship before she came back to the states. During this time we talked about the future, where she wanted to work, when we could see each other again, things we could do etc etc... The reason it was difficult is because I landed a job as a software developer in idaho that only pays 52yr. So plane tickets from Kentucky arent the cheapest. I also got us a hotel room and tickets to see one of our favorite bands tame impala. Well. When the day finally came where she returned to the states something happened. She did a complete 180 and told me she no longer wanted a relationship and wanted to be independent to travel the world and teach Marine biology. I was always supportive of this idea but the way she described it to me seemed that instead of a partner, I was more of an obstacle. And she eventually ended the relationship. I was hurt, really really bad.",
    "I keep making this mistake over and over and I want to stop. I just want to stop doing the same things over and over. Today I got out of bed and forced myself to go study with some friends, but about an hour in I just started hating myself and wanted to remove myself from my group. Now I have fallen into my same hole and pushed them away once again. Its not like it matters at all because this time I did it silently. They didnt react or notice. I dont matter in the slightest to anyone and its kinda sad. I know I should only care that I think I matter, but that thought is not currently something I am capable of. I just want help to not keeping pushing people out and ruining every situation Im in.",
    "Need help Im a 32 year old female who recently lost my daughter.

I cant get out of bed and havent for weeks  I cant eat and am down to 37kgs. Ive been in hospital with a feeding tube but took it out and discharged because I genuinely dont want to live any more. I have no one to talk to and I dont see any other option. Ive tried to be positive for so long but I feel like I have no energy left to try anymore. I dont know why Im posting this I just hope maybe if someone has been in a similar position they can tell me about their experience I guess. This is my first and final cry for help.",
    "I'm a failure Hi everyone, Im soon to be 19 years old My whole life I have not accomplished anything and have failed at everything I have failed my final exam for elementary and had to stay for another year Now I have just finish my highschool final exam and 100 Im going to fail In my country my final exam called SPM, u need to atleast get a C for Malay language and Sejarah  history  Im bad at languages I have failed The Malay language in my entire life, and also in elementary I took Chinese lesson I also failed all of the exam thats in Chinese and Malay I took extra class, study, speak that language and learn technique but no matter how hard I try I failed. Any languages I try to learn it doesnt go into my head When I was young, around 710ish in elementary school i stole a Lego robotic set. I was caught and got scolded badly by my father first time in my life It was one of the worst memory that still stick with me throughout my life and always appear when Im depressed in my highschool years I cheated in my exam over and over because I have been trying for 9 years yet my Malay languages isnt improving so I started cheating in my exam in my final two years in highschool. I was caught and got embarrassed and got scolded by my teachers I know what I did is totally wrong, then why did I do it? Truth is I dont know why I did it. Worst of all I already knew this would happen and I also know that cheating wont benefit me in any way. Also I tend to lie alot in my life, it has di e down alot but once in awhile I still do. Now that highschool is finish and now waiting for the result of the final exam, I have been depressed for 4 years snd is building up and the space of hope is getting narrower. When the government announce the date of the final exam result I will drink two bottle of cough syrup . I have already attempt suicide 5 times, the worst one was an overdose of paracetamol, painkiller and random medicine 2030 in 20min. I felt Ill and nauseous for 2 weeks,I was hoping to passed away in my sleep but I only felt tired and no appetite.",
    "I want to forget (everything) I want to forget my past, my family, my friends, my crush, my trauma, my thoughts, my desires, my hobbies, my preferences, my identity, even my name. I want to forget everything because Im tired of being something or trying to be something. In that case Ive spent all my life trying to become a somebody yet all of my friends are somebodies and I am a nobody. They have recognition and a reputation for the work they do yet I have nothing. So nothing is what I wish to become, because then I wont have to feel anything or do anything and be at peace.",
    "Do I have the right to be upset with my s/o for deciding to “taking a break” during a depressive episode? Im on mobile so please excuse the formatting. I have been dealing with depression for awhile. Ive been in a long term relationship for 3 years. Recently, he has told me he cant handle my episodes. I have mostly good days but still some bad days. Yesterday, I had an awful day. I couldnt get out of bed, and when I finally did I was felt like a zombie. I was extremely vulnerable, crying, and deeply sad. Yesterday he told me I was becoming too much to handle. Hes told me he doesnt have the capability to feel empathy, so every time I have an episode he thinks Im fighting with him. Ive told him multiple times Im having an internal battle that has nothing to do with him. My episode was stressing him out and he left. We live together and he went to stay with his cousin that lives 3 hours away. I dont want to be alone and Ive never felt so angry at myself for making him leave. I just need comfort and support. I dont know when hes coming back. I have never felt more alone. Am I overreacting?",
    "Are my feelings valid if I don't cut, or harm myself? Its so hard to turn away. I know now, it was a very, very abusive situation, which I kept putting myself into it. It wrecked my self esteem, and self worth. Through constant breakups, and fights which I could never win, and eventually relenting to, it puts you on tiptoes, around anything you do or say. Anyhow, after the sadness, came nothing. There wasnt happiness nor love, just nothing. I still cared for people, and loved them, but I discarded all emotions I felt for them when speaking, or trying to talk to someone. Its almost like an offswitch was flipped, I began seeing things from a perspective which wasnt how I was. It wasnt exactly pessimistic per say, just more observant. Being able to read situations not with sympathy, or empathy, more with observation. Now, I guess, I struggle to understand how I feel myself. And this is where the issue comes in. I have known many people to cut and harm themselves. And every time I look at my situation, I cannot help but feel selfish? Im in a comfortable, content position in my life. I dont feel the need to kill, or harm myself. And I feel pitying myself is so selfabsorbed. I believe, if I were to tell anyone how I felt, it wouldnt be valid, itd be brushed off as sadness as I do not have the desire to harm myself. Its hard to truly explain what I mean, and I feel I have made this post much more differentiated from the point I was trying to make. But I truly, believe my feelings are selfish. There is so many people whom are hurting themselves, and Im here feeling sorry for myself, over a reason that is not to exist. Im upset, over feelings that arent real? Im living my every day life normally, whereas so many people cannot do the same. I do not know what to make of what Im feeling, and was hoping someone may be able to help?",
    "Help with meals I have trouble eating. Hardly anything tastes decent enough to eat. Im a picky eater in general and when Im depressed I cant even make chocolate a favorite palettable. Often I starve just because food is so unappetizing. But I have to eat, especially at work because I become emotional and cry in front of clients. To complicate matters, I just dont have much energy to expend in making a complex meal or the know how to do it. Any recommendations for something I can take to eat at work? I have done sandwiches, ramen, and shakes, but the sandwiches get boring, ramen tastes bland, and the shakes arent filling enough if they taste decent at all.",
    "My uncle is getting severely depressed, how to help him. So my uncle recently unfriended a toxic friend who drained him off his money, convinced him to unfriend all of his friends and introduced him to alcohol and drugs but after he unfriended him he became really lonely and started getting intoxicated even more, almost stopped going to his job and talking really pessimistic like wanting to kill himself and what is the use of living anymore. I dont know how to help him, whether to seek professional help or to do something else. I am really sad and in pain from seeing him spoil his life and health like this. He roams around wearing the same shirt and not even admitting he is depressed. A little advice would be much appreciated.",
