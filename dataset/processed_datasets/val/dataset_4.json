    "Can’t believe we’re almost halfway through the month Still done nothing, i havent left my room since the start of the month. I have no friends And Im 17 its going to be impossible soon. I thought since this was pride month things couldve been different but its not. Im planning on taking my life soon im miserable every day and what happens when Im and adult and I have to get a minimum wage job, I barely even wanna wake up now when I do nothing all day and I dont know if my anxiety could let me have a job and if I dont then I dont wanna be a adultchild. Death just seems like a perfect out to all my many mental problems. Sure Ill never become a woman or find someone to love but I wont even know... because Ill be dead",
    "Can someone remind me why life is worth it? This is a genuine question. I know it is, and I know things will get better, but I feel like after what Ive lost Im not going to find anything that will ever make me happy. Everything just feels mundane and joyless and like nothing matters. Cliché things like it will be better over time and you just have to learn to enjoy the small things just arent working. I really want to just feel again. By the way, dont worry about my safety. I never actually want to end my own life. I know things get better.",
    "My friends doesn't believe in be and doesn't respect my wish to be alone for a while My friend doesnt believe in me and doesnt repsect my wish to be alone for a while. I have a problem with a friend in which I could really use some advice about. In mid dec. I told my nearest friends, that I need to be alone for a while. I was waiting for starting in a treatment with some therapeuts, and needed to step back since all the expectations from my surrounding became too much and left me up with anxiety. I cancelled christmas, new years eve and went on the sick leave. Ive been depressed since the beginning of last year maybe months before acutally when my now ex, broke up with me. And this has been the BEST thing Ive ever done to myself. I do have contact with my mum, who supports me 100. And a little with my dad, whom I struggle with. And this leaves me to focus on how to deal with him, since that relation in itself has been so toxic for me as well  so much that I didnt had energy to focus on it. Because I have so little energy atm. This one friend, lets call her ST is the one Im having troubles with. December was tough. A family member choosed to not talk with me anymore, December should have been anniversary day w. my ex  it reminds me of my sad little family, not so many friends and two earlier suicide tempts another ex  a dear friend. So Dec in general is a REALLY tough month for me. I went on the sick leave this Dec, because it just became to much. I then called ST to tell her about my choice  also telling her that earlier this year I was so depressed, that I tried to take my own life. But that Im not there anymore, but fear to end there if I dont take myself seriously. She got mad and told me that being on the sick leave is the most stupid thing ever  because I was ALMOST recovering, and almost starting up my own business etc. I got angry and told her that I just needed my friends to believe in me  and believe me when I said that this choice was the right one for me.",
    "Please. Help me. Ive been feeling low all the time. Ill be graduating in June and I dont even have a job. Although Im trying to brushup my skills, but I lack confidence in everything. I find it really hard to brag or to lie about me. Everytime theres a new opening for a jobinternship i just dont apply thinking I lack skills, Im not good, they wont hire me, I wont perform well in the interview, my resume sucks etc etc. I used to be really chill amp confident. But now everythings gone. Every day I code to be good at it and find me an internship. Every night I cry thinking about all the wrong decisions that I made during college amp that all of my friends are ahead of me , chasing the perfect lifestyle with jobs in hand. While I on the other side is marching into the world of depression day by day.",
    "This is a cry for help... I spent the next 8 months completely depressed. I can describe my mood like instead of blood, some sort of black ink was being pumped into my vessels. I spent nights crying and punching the wall. I moved to another town for college. Dated 3 more girls but I couldnt love them and I still wanted that specific girl. I dropped out of college and moved back to my hometown to my family to start studying for the big test again and get accepted in a university. How did that happen? 8 months after my breakup, While I was spending my days and nights depressed as fuck, I saw something on Instagram. A girl from my hometown whom I had a crush on for a year followed me on Instagram. I saw her post and stories to know her better, and she was EXACTLY my type. Her taste in music, her beliefs atheist and her style and her face. She was kinda the one. As Persian names are not familiar to you, I refer to her as Jane. And, I refer to myself Jack. I started talking to her on Instagram, and we hit it off. I reached one of my girlfriends who knew her. And asked her if Jane is single. She said she got back together with one of her ex boyfriends, and that guy is a fucking douche. He had convinced Jane that their breakup was her fault and she needed to grew up. Jane is also 19, and the guy was 20. That guy was driving Jane crazy. He disrespected her in every possible way and didnt care. I saw that as a great opportunity that when they breakup again, I can date her and treat her the way she deserved to be treated. So I waited. But the next day, that friend told me that Jane asked her did Jack say anything about me to you? She said no, but told her that a long time ago she heard from one of her friends that Jack is into Jane. She told me that the moment she told that to Jane, Jane got very happy and excited, and told her that she has a crush on me too. I couldnt believe what I heard. I wanted her but she was into me too?",
    "I feel depressed but feel like even more of a loser for feeling depressed. This might not resonate at all with some people. Its always been hard to explain. Ive never actually told anyone in this level of detail before. I have this overwhelming notion that im a loser. It always in the back of my mind but often times itll just overcome me a little bit. I struggle pretty occasionally with depression. Had about a year and a half in high school where it was really bad, never told anyone. Off and on in college, never told anyone. Overall I know a lot of people struggle with depression and many very likely have it much worse than me. Given that, I always felt the need to suck it up and control my attitude. Sometimes i think i do a pretty good job of it honestly. Pushing on and such. Ive always been able to put on a face paired with the fact that ive never given off the presentation of someone who is struggling deep down. Ill get to one thing that I think complicates things at least for me. I come from a really rich family. Pretty much a carbon copy of the daddys money type although one of the very few personal attributes ive been able to take pride in is my personality doesnt reflect it. I would say the fact that im an only child makes it even more surprising. As ive gotten older ive gotten much more grateful for how my parents have raised me in that sense. I graduated from college last May with a business degree that my parents paid for, of course. I have a stable job and i have a really great group of friends, most of which are elsewhere now for their jobsschool. Ive never really accomplished anything in life. Ive always felt like kind of a loser since high school. I was an average student. Pretty bad at sports even though I dedicated a pretty huge part of life to them at one point. I went to college far away. I graduated and went home and couldnt find a job in my field at all. I have a stable job now, albeit not something i wanted to do nor do i enjoy.",
    "Letting my boyfriend commit suicide. Please help. When I think about him being dead I get so many instrusive thoughts about him not being okay if there is an afterlife  that hes lonely, scared, or in more pain that he was here. As illogical as it may be, I think about how he might be scared, experiencing regret, or in pain in his last moments  I think about how that will lie with him forever and hell never get to know that he is finally okay. I know it probably sounds extremely dumb. He says hes not scared of death, and that helps me slightly. Im in so much pain now, and Im scared of how much pain is to come. I think about the moment I find out that hes dead and how Ill just want to scream at the top of my lungs. Ive been suicidal myself for years now and I think this is what will push me over the edge. Im scared of that. I love him. Hes my best friend, and I wanted to spend my life with him. Hes lying in the other room right now, and I dont know how to manage when the day comes where I can no longer go and lie next to him and give him a cuddle. Im terrified if forgetting him. Im trying to make mental notes of his features, and smells, and little things he does. Unfortunately, derealization has made my memory very poor. Were long distance, and have had very little time together in person. Im from the US and hes from the UK. I dont think Ill be able to attend his funeral because I wont be able to afford to travel, and covid might not allow it anyway. Im not sure Ill ever be able to step foot in the UK again. About him Hes mid 30s. Hes been on disability his entire adult life. Being dependent on the government for money and housing is one reason he feels hopeless. He believes hes locked out of ever getting a decent job now and doesnt think hed be able to cope with one anyway. He doesnt like his living situation. Hes very pessimistic and misanthropic. He thinks he may be in the autism spectrum.",

    "I'm a College Student Struggling with Depression Ive been struggling with depression for years. Im hoping to graduate in the spring, but I wont if I dont get myself back into shape. Last year wasnt so bad, but its really hit me hard this semester. I had to withdraw from a class and am behind in all my others. I keep making lists of the things I need to do and try to take them one at a time, but since Ive missed so much class and everything is already going to be penalized for being late, I feel like its becoming impossible. Getting help right now isnt really an option. I was supposed to get a scholarship this year but its delayed because of some confusing financial thing, so Im out of cash. I dont have enough for even one copay, or pay for transportation to see a psychologist. Professors are emailing me about assignments and Ive been giving excuses for months. The school wont give me accommodations because my diagnosis is too old. I dont get financial or emotional support from my family so thats out. All I can do is try to go to class and do the work, which makes it all the more stressful. I feel like Im always loosing time and never making progress. I try to do a little here and there but I cant seem to keep up my focus or motivation. I just want to be able to get the things done and feel better, at least about being a semidecent student. Thanks for reading this vent session and thank you some more if you have any words of support or advice. Sorry about any typos, Im just getting it all out in hopes of receiving some advice before I lose the motivation to post.",
    "Losing a Dream I have always struggled with depression. I have constant feelings of not being good enough. Lack of self confidence. Life has been a rough road but its made me who I am. Recently I thought I found my soulmate. She made me feel a feeling I never felt in my life. She gave me so much needed self confidence and I gave it to her as well. Life was on the up. Things were complicated with current relationships but we knew it was going to be tough and I was willing to give her the world and totally shake mine up for it. At some point something changed. Extreme feelings of happiness to guilt, settling, lack of confidence in the situation and shutting it out. Now I am left feeling not good enough. I knew in the back of my mind I wasnt going to be but was always told otherwise. It felt like the most amazing dream. It was shattered. I dont know why but now I am left feeling a shell of what was being built up. I feel used and betrayed. It has been extremely hard to open up about the situation. I am very private and so is she. I just feel completely devastated and being now totally cut off from even a friendship I feel like someone died and its all my fault. I opened my heart and mind and they are left in tatters. I just dont know how to go on. Any words of advise or personal experience would be so so very grateful. I feel completely lost.",
    "I don’t know what’s going on They cant understand what Im going through. Before this covid 19 shit, everyday I go to school I just see everyone in their groups talking and smiling. And I dont know, for 3 months I really havent felt like Ive been a part of a group, man. I dont feel like anyone out there is gonna give me the support. The last relationship I was in, I thought I fell in love with her, and she said she loved me too. But I always fought with her. I realize now that it was just me trying to push her away, because I was scared of her leaving, so I tried to push her away subconsciously because I was scared that she would break my heart and so i just wanted to have an excuse to break it off first before she could have a chance to hurt me. And I kept telling her to leave, but she said that she wasnt gonna go anywhere because I was worth it. And slowly I started feeling at ease. But then we broke up. We had a huge fight about her not putting me first, her best friend getting in the way. I said I would choose my dreams over her, but I also said I didnt want to lose her. And then she said I lost her already. And we broke it off. She said that she would stay. She said she would stay and figure it out. But she didnt. I guess she just couldnt take it anymore. Everyone tells me theyre going to be there for me, but when I need them the most they arent there. Its hard for me to trust. Sophomore year, second semester, I lost faith in everyone. My best friends left me. I felt so alone. I hovered around different friend groups but I still felt alone. I was bedridden for a time. I think I buried it deep down , because I dont remember much about that year except how I had the worst season in soccer of my life and that I wanted to die. I didnt see a reason for living, and I hated everyone. And then that summer I got my shit together, started training for soccer,and I thought I healed.",
    "My problems are ruining my relationships. (I’ve also realized that I really don’t like myself.) Like a month ago Ive met a girl and weve been texting every day since then. She has a very good influence on me. My problems stress, sadness, anxiety etc. are getting easier to deal with thanks to her. But feeling better naturally comes with worrying about losing this goodness... a lot... I worry about losing her so much that its probably not having a very good impact on our relationship... Even though I feel better that doesnt mean Im totally fine. I still get these waves of insert any of my problems here. We very often argue when this happens. Im extremly worried that this will end up ruining my relationship with her. She will not like me anymore if I keep having these waves... Yesterday we were talking and she brought up how I have very low selfesteem. She wanted to help so she recommended something that has helped her with her selfesteem issues. Go to a mirror and say I love myself. I was almost unable to do this... I mean I said it but I didnt belive it and it made me feel way worse because I didnt think it was THIS BAD... Then I realized how much I dont like myself... Ive felt like shit because of that since yesterday. Its getting better today, thankfully. She probably isnt too happy about having to deal with me in these situations... Im not sure what to do... I really dont want to lose her because of this... I hope someone has some good advice for this...",
    "I just told my parents that I had depression, it didn't go well at all. No matter from where you are and which century you got born in, problems such as depression doesnt leave the world, everyone can get depression depending on the situation that they are having. My Iraqi parents went through alot when they were in Iraq, they went through tough wars and time where they dont have food or water. They moved out of the country to Dubai, where I got born and raised in. We all know that depression can cause people to suicide, but my parents had another thoughts. I am a mechanical engineering student studying in Malaysia, for the past year, i got soo stressed by the amount of assignment, tests, lab reports, lessons that I have to study, and extra work that i need to do to have a good GPA. Going through al of that made me go insane and depressed, i reached out for help ofc, it helped abit but not that much, so I had to relay on myself, and heal myself. And thankfully, im doing well nowadays. I decided to adopt a cat recently, because first i like cats alot, and second, i read alot of researches that says pets can help people with depression. My dad is an animal guy, so he doesnt mind at all. But my mom has allergy and asthma, so convincing her is pretty hard. Today, I told my mom i had depression, and if adopt a cat it would help me alot to avoid the same senario. Instead of asking why I had depression and what caused it, she decided to say smth rude, which was You getting depression because of school pressure and you wanting a cat is all a girl thing, dont be a girl and man up At that moment I felt that smth pinched my heart and I just wanted to leave the house to somewhere else, she made me feel as if my problem didnt exist and i was faking it just to get a cat, i was soo offended and now im scared that ill get depressed again. I know my parents went through alot, but they should take such situations seriously, no matter where you got born or in which century.",
    "So, I decided to go to psychiatrist, but now I feel like Im not that bad? How bad is really bad? Maybe I just act dramatic I cry a lot without any specific reason, I want to kill myself quite often, but... I dont know if I really need therapy? Maybe its just who I am, just a lazy whiner? And when I will come to therapist I dont know what to say, what if that day I will feel fine and they will not believe me? I dont look like I struggle all the time, people around me dont even know that I have problems, Ive always been a comedian in a company. Im just a little bit afraid. I dont know if i really need therapy, and if I dont, so what do I need to feel normal?",

    "Best mood tracking apps Ive been struggling with depression for most of my life and recently its been getting really bad. Since my mood is all over the place, I think having something to help me track it will help me better monitor my mood and give me more to report to my shrink. Does anyone have any mod tracking apps they would recommend? Something thats relatively easy to use and can help me find a possible pattern similar to a period tracking app for example. Thanks.",
    "I don't know what to do at this point other than end it. Nothing has helped so far. Title explains it in tbe most TLDR way possible, but Ill add another at the end if this ends up too long. Abuse, sexual assault, violence, suicide, self harm, NSFW, and addiction is all mentioned. Tread with care. ._. Just a little background I am an 18 year old preeverything FTM in high school. I live with my parents and my disabled younger brother. I almost attempted suicide last night, I guess. A friend talked me through it and helped me fall asleep, but now that Im awake all the feelings have just come back. I have been casually suicidal for like, 2 years at this point and have attempted suicide twice before. The thing is, I really dont want to die. I just want it all to stop hurting. Its just that nothing Ive found so far can make it stop hurting. Id just.. really like some advice about where to turn now, thats all. And maybe some validation or support. A lot of things have happened over the course of my life, and it gets really long. So like I said, Ill add another TLDR at the end, but here are the events that have lead up to now, listed neatly in chronological order. I have a lot of memory gaps, which I assume is a defense mechanism against trauma, so I will try my best. Before I was born, my parents who had met at 12 and 13, and are still married at 41 and 42 were severely abusive to each other. Physical fights, using weapons or objects to harm each other, severe emotional abuse. My mom tells me about a time she kicked my dad down the stairs 3 times while he was drunk, just for fun, and laughed at him each time. She laughed about it as she told the story despite the mortified look on my face. I swear, theres something wrong with her. Both of my parents had really bad home lives growing up, apparently, but my dad especially. Anyway, my dad was an alcoholic troublemaker who always ended up in juvy, or eventually jail. My mom was some sort of sick twisted bitch or whatever.",
    "I have been severely depressed and it is affecting my school work and looking for advice Since Ive hit my 20s, my depression has just plummeted. In high school, I hadnt been diagnosed yet with my anxiety and depression, and even though it was present it didnt feel nearly as bad as this. I hit my 20s, now 23 yrs old, and I am having constant depression cycles. The cycles are becoming more frequent and each time it feels harder to come out of. As of lately I have been probably the most down that I have felt to date. I am in my sophomore year of college as a bio major. I havent been keeping up with classes, I have been failing exams and I dont have nearly enough credits to keep my scholarship for my junior year. I have fucked myself so badly with school I dont know what to do. I want so badly to take a leave of absence to get myself together, up my medication and see a therapist. I really want to get better. However, if I take a leave from school I will lose all financial aid for my junior year as well. My fiancé and I are pretty financially responsible people and have budgeted out for the next year and a half based on the financial aid we both receive. It is not an option to lose that money or we will be completely fucked. I am asking advice on what to do. I need to take a break from school or I will just keep digging myself deeper into this GPA and depression nightmare, but we also cant lose any money from it. I do want to reenroll for the fall semester, but I just need a break now. I am lost. Any advice would be so helpful.",

I got really paranoid and closed my blinds and lay in bed with my phone ready to call the police. I dont use any drugs, I just drink caffiene. I swear I think i had a manic episode or something as I was almost certain I was going to die right there and then. I lay in bed and came back to life and realised that nothing happened. I felt awful and really low, I felt like everything was out of my control. I finally got up and forgot that I have work in like an hour.

I feel awful not being able to get a job and getting my shit together but nothing makes me feel motivated or happy. I really just want to be able to feel nothing, more out of convenience for my own and everyone elses sake. I do really want to kill myself but I would never do it cause I know that it can fuck up those around you and I know what a persons death can do to people. I feel more like Im just waiting for everyone to leave just so I can die without fucking anyone up. I know Im quite smart  the only good thing I would say about myself and I kno there are people with lot bigger problems who still keep going but that thought only makes be feel more guilty but I also know everyones pain is still significant, I just go in a constant circle. My only safe space has been my bedroom cause its been the only place I could cry and breathe without being in edge around people. Ive done self harm, Ive done therapy, Ive tried getting better by myself but I feel like Im stuck in the same place constantly.

    "We were engaged. He left me for a 19 year old he has been talking to online for the past 3 months Now that he had found this other girl, he felt he really connected with someone. I was stabbed in the back multiple times by the person that always said that I was his soulmate and by a girl that came into my life pretending to be my friend, and I actually believed that. This same day he unblocked her in all social medias and changed his profile picture everywhere it was a picture of us. So yeah, my world just fell apart in a matter of days. He became what he criticized the most and I became what I feared the most. Im already a skinny person and I lost around 4kg in a week. I never had trouble sleeping, now I simply cant have at least a decent night of sleep. I wake up in the middle of the night many times with my heart racing, I have multiple nightmares about the situation. I even had a few panic attacks. I dont have energy to do anything. Im on my last semester of college and I cant do anything. I cant eat, Ive thrown up multiple times and just seeing food makes me nauseous. I honestly rather be dead than have all these feelings. Less than a month ago I was the happiest person ever, I had something to look forward to, I had someone in my life that I thought that loved me. Turned out it was just a huge lie.

    "I’m not sure if it’s depression, I just see no point in living. This is my first post on Reddit and Im not really sure where else I can talk to. For the last 2 years or so Ive lived every day bored, and I mean bored as in bored of having no friends or people to talk to, bored of constantly feeling like shit and knowing Im causing the ones closest to me pain, bored of spending 40 minutes scared to leave the house because of how bad I look. Ive not seen a point in living for a long time now and people around me ask why Im so down or why I dont talk much and I just see no point, I know none of them care about me or care about the answer so whats the point in replying. Every night I go to bed I literally pray to god, even though I dont believe in him, that I die in my sleep as Im too scared to actually kill myself. I get so easily pissed off and pissed off at the fact I feel like this, I have so much more than most people and what most people could ask for and I just still feel like a constant shit bag always letting down others and as everyone around me says oh you have so much to do etc and youre only 17 none of it matters. I just hate every day as it goes on and theyre just all merging into one big day. I dont remember the last time I was genuinely excited about something or happy for something that I wasnt forcing myself to feel. I just want to be happy, its all I want.

    "Help Changing for the Better Ive suffered silently with depression and anxiety for most of my life, usually covering it up with relationships or alcohol. Long story short, my depression and anxiety stems largely from childhood and teenage bullying and growing up in a home with very unhappy parents who werent meant to be parents. It wasnt until recently, on the verge of divorce, that Ive moved past the stigma of depression and admitted that I suffer from it. Ive been taking high doses of CBD and ltheanine daily Ive seen the unintended, scary side effects of prescribed antidepressents too often in former friends, in addition to daily meditation, getting outdoors daily for at least 30 mins, daily exercise and changing to a healthier, mediterranean diet. All of this had helped tremendously, but I still have occasional bad days like today where its a struggle to start my day. Due to my ongoing depression and anxiety, I havent used my brain the way it is supposed to be used, and as a result, I am very slow at thinking and making decisions in the heat of the moment. This has caused nothing but pain for me in romantic relationships and with roommates. I feel so incredibly stupid. I desperately need to change, and I have been trying, but it hasnt been easy. Every time I say this week is going to be different, it isnt. I get into constant arguments with my roommate because of my slow thinking and ingrained selfishness. I am reaching out for advice from anyone who has been where Ive been and made it through. How did you finally change for the better? Im at my wits end. I really want to change, I really do. My roommate says I cant because I just dont care enough. But I do care. I just cant figure out for once and for all how to improve myself 10x more e.g., my memory, my intelligence, my selfishness, being more aware of my surroundings, and most importantly, truly living life. Thank you very much for any advice anyone can give.",
    "Depression, procrastination and graduation Hello, thats my first post ever on reddit. I am in huge trouble and I put myself there now I need to face this but I dont know what to do. I always had panic attacks and alot of stress since I was just a child. but when I started university it doubled and I came to the point last year where I couldnt get out of bed, let alone study. I closed myself off and didnt get out of my room for a month, That had consequences on my grades and that made me hate myself even more. I used to be very disciplined, a grade A student so that felt like a punch to the guts. Anyway, this year I have a graduation project I need to work on. I thought I learned from that past experience but I really didnt. I was procrastinating out of fear for 5 months now. whenever I start I just start trembling and cant concentrate on anything Im reading. that led me to withdraw from poeple, my teacher my friends because Im too ashamed of my behaviour and I cant face them. Im in deep shit I want to get out of this but I dont know how. This is not how I thought my life and my view towards myself turn out . PS I was taking medications for anxiety and for depression but I stopped them now .",
    "Could you read me? Hi everyone. Im 18. I just entered Reddit,and I dont know how to start but I just need to talk about this because I simply cant talk to anyone around me. The text that Im about to write is going to be very long so I think many of you will not read. Doesnt matter, I just cant take this to myself anymore. ampx200B Some of the things I will describe might disturb some people. I dont even know if Im allowed to post this. But here it goes ampx200B Im a male, 18 years old going to 19 next month and I have been diagnosed with depression for the last three years. At first, I didnt know really what was the reason for my depression thats why I always recommend people who dont have a actual reason to be depressed to go to therapy and take a deep look into your life. You might find something that was really hidden in your subconsciousness. ampx200B Well, thats what I did. ampx200B I am going to tell the story of my life. For some reason, writing it helps me to process my thoughts. And yes, I want people to read it because Im just terrible expressing myself in real life, and I just want people to know, but I dont have the courage to tell it in person. ampx200B Okay. So I was born in Brazil one of the reasons that Im writing in English its because Im the only one in the family who speaks a little bit of English. So Im sorry if theres some bad English here. The city that I was born is really violent, which is the reason why my mother wasnt very pleased with the idea of me going to play with other kids in the neighborhood. My father, worked his ass off during the week, but was an alcoholic, and once even tried to kill my mother. Nowadays, hes fine and theyre still together. But those days were tough. So, since I was a child I was really close and sometimes, hyper protected to my momand the only other child company that I had was my brother, who is 3 years older than me.",

    "Should I give up on relationships for good? My story is long but I will shorten it. I am 17 and have been through 7 relationships. No matter what I do I am always cheated on or am left because someone better was found. I am starting to spiral down into a deep depression because I am slowly accepting the fact that I will never truly find someone who loves me for me. Today especially has had me down because I have been talking to this girl who is very moral and sweet. She sent me a screenshot of her bsf list and there was a default purple bitmoji named with a suggestive emoji. I am a solid 710. I workout and have a nice face and act flirty. I seem to look good and act good so why am I always having this happen to me. I have always wanted a family and to see my kids grow up but the fact that it wont happen is making me suicidal. I do not understand what women want anymore.",

And I dont know if that numbing is a part of the medication, or if I should ask for it to change? I dont get excited, but I dont get severely depressed anymore, and my anxiety is just a series of belly aches now. Do I have to trade betting emotionally free for stability? Or are there other options? Medication is lamotrigine, 25mg. 1dose every day at the moment, soon apparently to be upped to 50mg a day. Tldr numb from meds normal? Or should I try something else",

I was hoping to get everyones advice on how I should talk to her. ampx200B I want to make clear that they does not think shes depressed, but all symptoms are there. irritability, feeling of emptiness, mood swings, sadness, sometimes excessive substance intake. they even admitted they were depressed a while ago and had thoughts of killing or harming herself. ampx200B I am worried about her and if she wont accept and get help herself, Im trying to see how I can make things better.

    "How do I muster the energy to cook and eat, especially at the end of the day? Does anyone have tips or psychological tricks for getting yourself to eat regularly, especially at dinner? Im pretty good about eating on days when I have classes college student. I always eat before class so I can be energetic and focused and because stomach grumbles are embarrassing. I always have a healthy big breakfast. My problem is with weekends and dinner. Im usually mentally tuckered out after classes and interacting with people and rush to get home. When I come home, all I can do is curl up in my bed and maybe do homework in bed. Even doing something small like changing into PJs and brushing my teeth is very tough. Taking time to prep food and eat it is just a lot of mental effort, even if its just microwaving leftovers. I also live with others  I feel safe in my room but going into the kitchen is leaving my safety zone. My roommates are great but at the end of the day I really dont want to see anyone except maybe my best friend. When he comes over for dinner on occasion I feel motivated to cook and eat, but he usually has evening classes or work so I cant always rely on his presence. Or if Im out with friends and were getting fast food I can eat because I dont have to put in any effort and Im outside anyways. And weekends are really tough because I hate leaving my room just for food and I dont feel the same need to eat without classes to attend or things to do. So I end up eating one very hasty big meal of sandwiches or something when I get really hungry. Can anyone relate? Any psychological tricks people have for making themselves eat and get ready for bed? When I was living with family someone would usually tug me to the dinner table at night, but no one does that to me in college  I find it difficult to stay at a healthy weight for this reason. Its really easy to drop a few pounds when Im under additional stress some weeks I just cant do dinners at all.",
    "Overthinking is killing me I have always been shy, and was recently diagnosed with severe social anxiety. I have also been depressed for about 3 years now, after I had been bullied by some  friends  in middle school, 7th grade. 8th grade was even worse, I had lost all my friends, and had turned into a loner. My freshman year was the same, and the teachers even started to pick on me. Thats when I left, and decided to stay at home and do online school. Both of my parents are hard working, so they couldnt stay home with me, so I had absolutely no motivation at all to work on school, and barely passed. I am now a Sophomore and only have online friends. I overthink EVERYTHING to the point where I cant even text my friends online anymore, because I worry I will say something weird. It has never gotten this bad, I used to be funny, and I didnt overthink as much. I was almost outgoing. I dont know what to do. Ive tried talking to a few therapists before, but it has never helped and i am not sure about any medications. It is really hard for me to post this, but I need some help.",
    "My girlfriend is suffering from depression, and I’m looking for some advice on how I can be more supportive. For some context, weve been together for almost three years and a large portion of our relationship has been long distance. Shes been suffering from depression for most of her adult life and its been especially bad in recent weeks. Shes a recent college grad and is really stressed out about her future, and whether or not shes making correct decisions for her career. This causes her to feel anxiety, which in turn causes her depression to worsen and this cycle repeats. I know that I cant cure her depression, but I want to do all I can to be supportive while she figures out how best to deal with it. Recently shes been saying she doesnt feel like its fair for me to have to deal with her when shes like this, and shes worried thats its having a negative impact on our relationship. Ive never really had to deal with depression as closely as I am now, and am looking for ways to improve, or even just some advice on things to do to help. I always try to be supportive, letting her know that Im here for her and that I love her. Its been increasingly difficult for me as she often becomes withdrawn, and with the distance and our differing work schedules most of our communication is through texting. Sorry if this post has been a little lengthy, I havent had the chance to talk to anyone other than her about it. I appreciate any advice you guys can share.",
    "I’m lost Suicide thoughts First of all , I wanna say sorry for my bad English. I didnt go to psychiatrist , but Im pretty sure I have depression for 4 years . Back then I just felt like I lost all my positive emotions for no reason all of suden and I told it to friends and family and everybody was like  Its normal, it happens , it will disappeared... I cannot feel almost anything, when someone close to me die, I cant cry , when something good happens ,I cant smile sometimes but very rare I can feel euphoria  . I had no motivation and hope for better future then, and now is same . I have little health problems for 5 years ,and I cant even force my self to go to doctor because Im affraid of diagnosis, and things are worse now. People think Im doing a little bit better then earlier because I passed my entrance examination for college one month agolast year all my friends did it, I decided to make a one year break  . But college dont change anything. I m still big pesimits and cant feel anything. Actually I can feel fear. I have very strong social anxiety. I have 5 very close friends , they are like brothers to me and Im relaxed when Im with them , but when I talk to girls , Im totally confused. They even cant understand what Im saying because I dont open my mouth enough and speak very quiet ... I never had a girlfriend... Lets go back to social anxiety. Its very hard to go to for example market because Im overthinking what if someone asks me something, ... I have very good relationship with mother, not good but no bad relationship with sister , and very bad relationship with father its almost hate . I also have very often mood changings and I also take decisions very hard because I dont know what I want , and even when I take a decision, I change it very quick . I like watching soccer and basketball but its hard to concentrate to watching because my mind flyes somewhere... I cant find purpose of life. People dont understand how its hard when someone says  JUST FORCE YOURSELF AND GO TO DOCTOR , JUST GO OUT MAKE NEW FRIENDS ,... Sorry for long message .",
    "Im scared i will never have friends again I have had major depression and anxiety my entire life, but i stopped seeing a counselor years ago. In 2016 i had friends that i would hang out with that were also my coworkers. We drifted apart and its my fault. After getting a different job i had a lot of coworkers and some would ask to hangout with me, but i always refused. Something changed in me where i began to completely self isolate and push away anyone who tried to come close to me. Im an introvert, so i keep trying to convince myself that i dont want friends. But the truth is im scared of never having friends again. I realized that truly the only close friends i have in my life are my boyfriend that i live with, my mom, and my boss. Im grateful for them, but i feel self conscious because i dont have any other friends my age. I deleted all my social media because seeing my old friends hangout together hurts, as well as seeing posts of people with their friend groups. I waste too much time comparing myself to others. But now i feel 10 times more lonely without social media. How do i get out of this? I am too scared to reach out to old friends. Is it normal to have no friends? Have you gone through something similar? I would love to make online friends but i dont know how. I feel so alone, especially now that corona virus has taken away my job and i have no reason to go outside. I quit college recently too so its really hard for me to meet new people.",

The worst part is, that he has been away for two weeks to look after his parents house while they were on vacation and I have felt so good! So so good! So free.

    "Forcing yourself to do things you normally love during depression Im in the midst of a 5 week bout with depression, which for me has nothing to do with sadness. Rather, depression for me is a horrifying head fog that disconnects me from all emotions, interests and appetites. All I can feel is the fear and anxiety of being in this state of mind. If you suffer from this flavor of depression, or any flavor, do you force yourself to do the things your normally love even though you cant connect with that feeling of enjoyment?

    "Advice on how to deal/make progress So, Im currently in a hole with my depression, and I could use some advice on what to do and ideas on how to approach things, as Ive done a lot already. Its a bit of a story, but I will keep it as brief as possible. If youre reading this and want to help, thanks in advance! So depression has been a thing all my life, but I only got a diagnosis around 10 years ago Im 33. I am also disabled, having a diagnosis of autism and suffering from chronic fatigue. I got therapy, and eventually, medication. The therapy CBTlike didnt really help, but at least talking to someone was nice at times I had a good therapist. The medication did help. I was put on 50mg sertraline. Fast forward a few years, and I start to do worse. I get sick with bowel pain that appears to be persistent. A few other difficult things in my life happen, and my depression starts coming back. The pain eventually becomes so hindering I have to stop work entirely. I get a pretty intense comprehensive therapy program for dealing with unexplained symptoms, and it is overwhelming. I lapse back into deep depression. The decision is made to up my dose to 100mg sertraline, and I climb out of it. The lessons I learn from therapy eventually help, and helps me control the pain and lessen it somewhat, although the fatigue actually intensifies. Fast forward to around now, covid times. Turns out, telling someone with a tendency for severe depression stay inside and have as little contact as possible is a recipe for bad times. I live in a place where I dont have a social network, a result of them moving away and me trying but so far being unable to because disability and dependency on social housing, which is a mess. So events were very important to me, and theyve all been canceled now for about a year and a half. I honestly do pretty well for around 10 months longer than I expected, before things get bad and I seek out my psych again. The decision is made to up my sertraline dose to 150mg, although I note I am seeing a pattern of it stopping working every 3 years.",

    "Helping a friend with depression Heyy there! I just found out that a very good online friend of mine suffers from depression and feeling down. Initally she just asked for advice regarding a crush of hers who already is in a relationship. When talking to her about it tho, she told me a few things that really got me worried. On the one hand, she feels understood by him. She feels like herself around him and like she doesnt have to fake her happiness. On the other hand, she admitted to sending him nudes, as he told her Id be okay to send some from time to time and it could even be there hot little secret Needless to say, Im really worried now. I gave her the advice to stay away from himstop contact with him and also came to an agreement, that her and I would look for a psychologist at the same time so niether of us feels like a crazy person needing psychiatric help lol Still, Ill continue to try and help her. I already thought about asking her how she feels although it is incredibly hard for her to open up about her feelings, but also motivating her to go out or try something new or something. Just fyi I never met her personally, she lives about two hours away. We do talk jokingly about meeting up some time soon tho, so maybe Ill see her soon.

I was supposed to fly out in November so I can be there for her birthday but I begged shed come back in October cause I missed her so much, because of that she missed her appointments and couldnt get her medication and stuff and shes been here for a bit now. But she doesnt want to be with me.. the month before everything seemed okay. It was like we were in love again and she said that she thought she was but now that shes off her medication shes falling back into her old toxic behaviors she started developing after the things I did to her.. we argued a lot the first week she was here and I wish I wouldve just kept my mouth shut and I wish that I wouldve just went in November because wed probably still be together right now.. she leaves October 24th and it kills me seeing her here knowing that I had her again.. knowing I was a lot better.. but she doesnt want me anymore.. she says she doesnt want anyone for awhile until she can love herself.. and theres basically no chance Ill have her back.. how do I forgive myself? How do I stop hating myself? How do I love myself? How do I let her go? How do I stop these suicidal thoughts? Id really appreciate some advice.. I know I dont deserve sympathy.. thats not what I want..",
    "My mother and I had an unsettling conversation in the midst of my depression, and I don't know how to feel... They didnt even call my mother. Apparently, their logic was if I was disrespectful, they would call my mother like 22 times, but if I was injured, bleeding, and crying out in pain, they wouldnt give a shit! Ive never wanted to know about this, and now I have other bad memories I probably wont forget soon, even though I want to. To recap, I have have learned something I never wanted to about my past during depression, and now its even worse. Ive tried so hard to keep my life going in the right direction, but every time I try...it seems to get worse... Today, Im going to try a new way of doing things. Instead of deleting my exs requests and messages, Ill ignore her. Instead of being afraid and nervous, Ill send my gf a letter today, and Ill see how it goes. Instead of letting bullying weaken me, I will deal with it in a better fashion. Ill even report it everything. This was the advice I had been given, and I thank my friends on Reddit for helping me. Itll be a while, and I will struggle and sadden on the way, but Ill try... I still feel horrible on the inside and outside, but Ill try as hard as I can to be happy again. I dont know. What do you think I should do?",
    "I can’t feel anything, no matter what I do, I can’t feel anything physically or mentally I dont know whats wrong with me. Id say Im terrified, but Im not even sure I can feel terrified anymore. I just need help. Im sorry for how long this paragraph is. I know most of you wont even read it all, I know I probably wouldnt. If you did read it all, thank you. I just need help, and at this point in my life I could use any help I can get.",
    "Fantasy brings me much more pleasure than reality, so how can I enjoy life again? Ive been struggling with depression for 10 years, and Im at a point where Im ready to just throw my hands up, and give up trying to find joy in the real world anymore. Ive always turned to some form of escapism as a coping strategy, whether its gaming, cartoons, or even just watching random YT videos. Now, I feel like I would just be happier if I could live in that escapism all the time. If there was a way I could just spend my life sleeping and dreaming all the time, I would. Even my therapist has acknowledged that life wont be as much fun as living in a gaming world or watching cartoons, so whats the point? So far, the main answer seems to be you just have to do it. I dont wanna die, but I dont wanna live either. Im convinced nothing would make me happier than if I were to live in my own head.",
    "I'm drowning I feel like Im drowning. The past couple days I finally felt better... last night it hit me like a ton of bricks. I cant stop crying. It took all the energy I had to go to get coffee and lunch today... even that i took a couple bites and put leftovers up. I just want to crawl in a hole. Im so fucking alone. I cant be open to anyone when my depression gets bad because my whole life if it was bad my family thought I was just wanting attention. I feel like a burden and a waste of space.",
    "Women of Reddit: Does your period make you feel suicidal? Every time Im on my period my depression gets worse. I cant bring myself to do anything and my tears wont stop falling. I feel sad over the smallest things and get super exhausted. I think its time to end my life. Like the urge becomes strong and then I start thinking of ways and then I fall asleep. I dont want to go on like this forever. Life is the worst fucking thing to have happened to me and I want nothing to do with it. Im actually the weakest person Ive met. And I just realized that it gets worse during my period.",
    "I am so tired I have entered this on a different subreddit, but no one seems to be too responsive besides one person who I am really thankful for. I want to hear more from others.... Im a very introverted person, and Im smart. I know what I should do to get help, I know what the sources of my problems are, I know what I have to do. But I am so tired. To make a long story short, I was emotionally, physically, verbally, and sexually abused for the first eleven years of my life, and now I am adopted by my godparents, who I highly respect as my mother and father. Anyways, like I said, Im a private person. This means people say things to me without thinking how I might feel about it. I also do not share my past memories with others I need to move on. I cannot blame them for their ignorance, that would be rude. So when people get mad, and yell at me, I leave my face blank and take it. But its been hard lately. When my mom gets upset with me, practically anything that leaves my mouth is talking back or an excuse. It makes me feel like her scolding me about being ungrateful means I dont deserve what she gives me that I dont deserve a loving mother, I deserve what I had, and that my feelings are excuses. But I take it, and I bounce back. Those outside of family know me as a happy, innocent, smart, and responsible person. If I am ever anything except some state of happy, people think its weird of me. Because I always get back on my feet without them knowing I fell. But I am so tired of getting back up. Of forgiving everyone that has hurt me over and over. Of taking all of those offensive comments silently. Of fulfilling the expectations of those around me when I already expect perfection out of myself. Of trying to put effort into my appearance only to look at my own hands and feel revolted. Of acting. Of not feeling good enough for anyone.I sometimes wish I had a normal life, but look back on it and would rather it be me than anyone else. And I want someone to see that.",
    "My friends left me, whats wrong with me and how do I fix it? Im the one that makes the paragraph, while getting a one word response. My moms told me that I have a obnoxious personality, she doesnt know how she raised me to come out the way I did and that theres no wonder all my friends left me, and that when I go back to school Im not ever going to have any friends. So the basic question Im wondering is just... whats wrong with me? I can never stay happy for more then a few days before I fall into this loop of selfpity remembering all of the memories that we had. I just want to know what to do. I mean obviously I cant get attached to people the way I have been until they prove themselves by actions, but in order to get people to stay, they have to want to stay. So how do I become better? Thanks for reading this whole lifestory but yeah. Thanks.",
    "Had a house fire. Now having panic attacks/depression My house burnt down a week ago. My husband and I made it out with our pets but most of our belongings are ruined. Ive had dips of panic attacks and depression in the past but this set off a new wave. Now Im stuck in a panic cycle, constantly thinking about death and the fear of the unknown. I just wish I could feel normal. Its hard to concentrate on work and anything else. Cant eat, cant sleep. Constantly on edge. Its hard for me to even remember when I felt good. Now its just constant tension. Just looking for maybe some words of comfort or advice to deal with these depressing thoughts.",
    "I don't know what to do at this point other than end it. Nothing has helped so far. I have no personality or sense of self, either. I live with an overlying sense of guilt that I am at fault and that I deserve to be hurt, or worse. I have no hobbies and no interests, and never have. I do not enjoy anything I do in the slightest. To cope with not feeling anything, I have kinda reckless sex, hurt myself, and binge drink. I also occasionally smoke weed. The way my mom has treated me has ended up with me being diagnosed with borderline personality disorder BPD. After a hospitalization at 15, I was diagnosed with adolescent borderline personality disorder, so I have had it for a while now. Several therapists said I showed all traits by the age of 13 but couldnt diagnose me because of my young age. Anyways, moving on. So firstly, Im living with completely untreated BPD. The nearest specialist is an hour and a half away, and I have really bad insurance. My disability checks were taken away when I turned 18 last year, and my mom gets mad at me when I try to call to ask to fix this. My life is a living hell. I feel nothing at all, but at the same time, I feel everything at once. There is a void that I cant fill no matter how hard I try and Im in agony. Suicide is always on my mind, every hour of every day. I hurt myself often and binge drink to deal with the stress, or occasionally have reckless unsafe sex or smoke pot. When I was first brought to therapy, my therapist and psychiatrist had evaluated me for autism spectrum disorder and ADHD, and tried to refer me to a specialist. My mom screamed in his face that her perfect child could never be autistic. I have never been evaluated again, but have talked to my school counselor. She says Im most likely living with untreated ADHD or autism spectrum disorder, but most MOST likely both at once. My brother, who is emotionally and intellectually disabled, has both of these. So does my dad. Its in my genetics.",
    "How can I deal with Bipolar people? Im kind of sick of walking on eggshells around my dad... Hes sick and needs to be under watch, and my mom doesnt have that time while I do, so I chose to stay with him and help around. But its incredibly hard to deal with his mercurial temper  it can change at the drop of a hat! Sometimes all it takes to trigger his rage is a little comment. Im tired, my heart is tired. I cant give up on him because I know its a disease and not really his fault, but Im made of flesh and blood too! Does anyone has a way to deal with these kind of situation? Just sitting and enduring verbal abuse is so, so draining... my usual coping method is to wait until his temper cools down and for him to apologize  but everytime this happens I break a little. Advice please.",
    "Am I to blame for my boyfriends depression? Me and my boyfriend have a really good relationship most of the time. We want the same things and are usually very in sync, until we have a minor disagreement. To me they are mainly about trivial things like chores, but they always escalate because of how we both act. I get frustrated and either get angry and shout or really upset and cry. He just leaves, actually packs up his bags and leaves home. This happened again yesterday and he left. He came to pack his stuff today and after begging him he eventually opened up to me. He said he feels like a shadow of himself with work, friends, family and that he feels so much better away from me. He said some nasty things yesterday but this was really what he thought, and it really hurt me. Ive been doing some research and think he is depressed, I managed to get him to agree to get help today and said i would give him space for a couple of weeks while hes basically said hes seeing if hes better without me. I can barely breathe without him, and while I am so upset that he has treat me this way I just want him to come back to me. What happens if he realises he doesnt need me? i have no appetite or enthusiasm for anything and dont know how im going to function enough to go to work, let alone make it through the next 2 weeks, or longer, alone",

    "How in the actual heck does one love themselves I have a very bad problem in that the only way to love myself is that I receive love from other people a potential girlfriend. This is apparently very unhealthy and self destructive. Problem is, that is all I know about how to love myself. I have been told to love myself but I find that VERY difficult to do. I was raised in a household with a mother who was infuriated and enraged with seemingly small things and took things way too far pretty frequently. She took a lot of her anger out on my father and she did so in plain sight of me and my sister. Her use of pure hatred and rage towards my father rubbed off onto me. The difference is, that unlike her, I have the common decency to keep all this inside my head. A lot is directed towards the outer world and a lot is directed towards myself. I cant love myself, because the only two things I feel for myself are hatred and rage, so I look to unspoiled minds for affection. I know this is self destructive and it will just push me closer to pulling the trigger or jumping off the cliff, I know that. ampx200B I am looking for real, tangible, practical and usable advice for how to love oneself. The only advice I have received so far is that, You should love yourself. Great, what the heck does that mean? I have received advice like, Engage in your hobbies and court yourself. Well I already have hobbies and I do nice things every once and a while, no effect there. Plus, I dont have much time to engage in hobbies since I am a college student and despite having some money in the bank, I need to make more this summer. ampx200B If you have any advice, it would be greatly appreciated.",
    "I can’t feel anything, no matter what I do, I can’t feel anything physically or mentally I am a 17 yo male, who comes from an extremely abusive household, and Ive recently noticed that my feelings are almost non existent. I also cant feel any pain, some might think its a gift but its a fucking curse. Im numb to the core and I just want to be normal again. I havent eaten in 3 days because if I try to I throw up. Ive been getting 4 hours of sleep regularly and cant physically sleep longer than that. My father used to beat me and force me to torture rodents with him. I remember one time he made me drown a possum in a garbage can and hack a squirrels limbs off. By the time I was 8 years old I had already known how to disassemble, clean, and reassemble a .38 caliber pistol. My father was a narcissist, and I was his golden child. If I ever did anything wrong I was told I was making our family look bad. Id get a hell of a beating if I even said anything out of line, and my mother was constantly in and out of hospitals from her accidents. I believe my father is a large part of why I am feeling the way I am recently. I noticed I stopped feeling emotion when I had a stroke last March. I wasnt scared, or worried, I was calm, and didnt even feel anything. Even after I had almost lost my ability to play guitar, I wasnt sad or scared. Ever since then, its just gotten worse and worse. My girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me and all I had to say to her was ok. Honestly it was probably best for her, I dont know if I can feel love anymore, so whats the point of trying. I recently noticed I cant physically feel pain when I was trying to fix the shingles on my roof. I missed with the hammer and smacked my hand right on the thumb, but I didnt feel anything. Just to test my theory, I smacked the back of my hand full force. I heard the crunching of bone, but still felt no pain. I dont know whats wrong with me.",

    "In love with my best friend who doesn’t see me like that. So Iv known this guy for over two years now and the moment I met him I started to fall for him. We are both mid 30s and have a real connection. We actually met from a online hook up at the beginning and he ended up staying here for a few nights, but after a week when I asked him for a date he said he wanted to stay friends as that was more important. I still remember how much it broke my heart then when he rejected me, but we hung out nearly every day. He stayed at my place most of the time and we just became really close. We sleep together whenever we stay at each others places, just cuddling. Over the years I have fallen deeper for him and I had already suffered with my own mental health before all this but now I feel so torn. He is literally my one and only friend, Im terrified of having another talk about my feelings with him in case I push him away again. We didnt speak for a few months as he wasnt very understanding that I couldnt stop loving him. I cried every single day when we stopped talking and this was during lockdown last year. It was awful, I think about him all the time and I have a lot of trouble sleeping with my mind just racing. Mostly When Im with him I genuinely feel myself and happy, but then I always wish for more. I dont know what to do, I feel like if i stepped away again from our friendship I wouldnt last. Its not that I want to end my life, but for awhile now I just wish I was dead. He keeps me tethered here, so I dont know do I just hide my feelings and say nothing and hope the friendship works. I would have been a very outgoing, proactive and positive person but I dont feel that anymore. I burst out crying a few times a day about my life, I dont really sleep, I cant really eat which isnt good cause Im already v skinny. Over the past few years Iv lost many friends to suicide so I know how terrible it is, but lately I really find myself understanding why they did it and tbh I dont have the guts to go through with it.",

Then my other diseases hitted hard and I needed to quit the job because I was to weak to do it. I went back to school to learn more flemish.

Trying not to self harm or worse, and today I realized that whatever medication does to me, Ill be alive to deal with it, and that might not be the case if I dont start taking it. Spoke to GP, and I can pick it up tomorrow. Im so scared itll make things worse, but I cant cope with how I am now. Still have the stupid feeling that Im not depressed enough to deserve meds, but that particular little internal voice can suck it. Any tips?",
    "I want to be happy again. Goal Currently I am all timer sad and want to be happy. I am neither a good person nor a bad person. I am somewhere in the middle or maybe totally out of circle. I dont know. I feel like I am living three lives. One which I show to my Family, one to friends and excolleagues. I am jobless. And one my true self which I show to myself only. Of course any differences in personality from my true self I manage by pretending someone else in my other two lives. But as soon as I enter my room and after carefully slowly locking my door I throw away the mask I was wearing and then I can clearly see the differences in my voice, thoughts, body language and goals, if any. My body feels so relieved. Then I start getting back in my true zone where I forget the tasks and goals I had planned in my mind. And I start feeding myself the worthless shit on Internet. At that time, I am only looking for that temporary dopamine hits because nothing simpler was giving me any joy. I started losing myself in weed. I sometimes was stealing weed from my friends or roommates. After smoking for at least 3 years, a small joint was not that powerful anymore to bring down the curtains covering my real life problems. So, I jumped to eating. Now again, simpler food was not any joy. Junk is pretty much gonna hit the Dspot. Small meals mean less dopamine. Give me more and more. Dont worry, Ill puke the previous and eat again until I am so wasted by the effort of eating  throwing  eating throwing and of course the taste of food. There are consequences too. Bloating, Gas, Always upset. But nothing can stop me from doing it again and again atleast from last 2 years nothing has stopped me. Then in search for more dopamine I look for porn. Again, simple means no joy. Fell into HeteroBBC  Trans  Sissy. Now I dont imagine me having sex with girl instead I am that girl and big funk is fucking me. I started dreaming about dicks. Bought a vibrating dildo.",
    "How do I gauge the success of my antidepressant without knowing what the “best case scenario” actually feels like? At this moment in time, I am on 60mg prozac a day. I just cant seem to stop wondering about how to know when I have found the correct prescription. It has been a few months of increasing the dose and Id like to believe it has been helping me, but I cant tell if its all in my head or if it is just coincidence I have been having one or two good days a week instead of none. prozac is the only antidepressant I have been prescribed over the years, and while I am hesitant to try something unfamiliar, the idea that there might be a more effective medication crosses my mind frequently. I struggle greatly with low energy levels motivation fatigue and it would suck to know that all of this time I could have been pursuing a prescription that was a better fit. I feel like I have been making decisions blindly simply because I dont have the experience of another antidepressant to compare the effectiveness.",
    "What to do when you notice yourself slipping back into depression? Ive had depression from 20152017 but never went to therapy. It got better because of a good network of friends and living with someone who motivated and helped me get through it. Now I feel like Im slipping back into old habits. For context I had covid last Christmas. Since then I struggle with fatigue, tiredness, lung problems and my thyroid. I havent found a doctor that was able to help me yet. Everybody dismisses me because there is no cure for long covid symptoms. I got an asthma spray and thyroid medication but it doesnt help. It scares me so much. I tried to get back into fitness and train my lungs. Yesterday I couldnt even finish jogging for 1,5km. Im 24, F, normal weight. I feel like a failure. Because I cant even run for such a short distance. Also Ive been quarantining for the last two weeks and ate way too much. My medication also made me gain weight. I feel horrible in my body. And I feel weak because i cant fight it. My boyfriend always tells me Im strong because I gave it a try but I cant accept that Im chronically ill and suffer every day and there is nothing I can do about it. It got so bad during the quarantine that I couldnt let him kiss me because I didnt feel like I deserved him. At the same time I want to hide how I feel because Im scared he will get fed up if Im depressed all the time. Its like a self fulfilling prophecy. I just want to lay in bed all day, I am scared to go back to work, I think about eating all the time and there isnt much Im excited for because of covid. Does anyone have advice how to get out of this lump and motivate myself? I want to fight it but the only thing that comes to mind is sports and I cant really do that physically.",
    "I think I might have depression, but I’m scared to approach my parents about it. What should I do? Ive been struggling with this for a couple of months now, and I dont know what to do about it. I know its important to reach out and talk about your mental health, but it makes me nervous to even think about doing that. Additionally, I have autism and have been diagnosed with anxiety, which I am currently taking medication for but something still doesnt feel right. Am I being unreasonable with this? I know I need help, but I dont know what to do.",
    "Hi i'm new and I feel \"weird\" sometimes Hi, for a few weeks Ive been dealing with this weird feeling, some days Im quite normal, happy, serious, but I feel that Im using well my energy, and there are some other times like right now that Im just sitting trying to focus in something but there also more thoughts in mind that cant give a chance to focus, I dont feel the energy for do something, I feel with tears but theres none and neither a clear reason for do it, may be this is part for been one year unemployed but if theres someone here that have been through this or something similar, could be useful to read it.

    "Why can’t I quit MY job because of health problems? I love my spouse. Truly, 100. Shes the only thing that keeps me going most of the time. But Im still stuck at my shitty job, and its negatively affecting my mental and physical health. Back in February, she quit her job because her anxiety and agoraphobia got so bad that she couldnt go in to work. She just stopped going and told her boss that it was health related. She was unemployed for a few months while she searched for something else and I was the only wageearner during that period. My car broke down, we lost our storage unit, I struggled to make rent, etc. Shes working again and making more money doing something thats better for her health and Im so happy for her. But Im losing it. Im slipping. Im angry all of the time. Physically, Im in a lot of pain. My wrist hurts every time I move it. My back aches. My knee which I injured last year has never had a chance to heal properly because Im always working. Mentally, Im struggling. I cant keep going on like this. I need to quit my job. But when I say that, my spouse just says, Ill help you apply for jobs. Ill help you write a cover letter. My mother says I shouldnt quit without a job lined up. But my spouse quit her job without having something lined up. Why am I not allowed to quit? And if I mention maybe going back to work with kids again, my spouse freaks out because she doesnt want me working with kids because of the pandemic. I just want out of this job! Why cant I just LEAVE?",
    "Don't understand my depression 28 year old male here. Im having a bit of trouble expressing what my depression really is. To my therapist, my psychiatrist, my longterm boyfriend, hell even to myself. I dont want to kill myself, I dont want to die, I just want to not be... me. My selfesteem and confidence is zero, but I put on a happy face. Unfortunately Im funny, so when I finally express how Im really feeling it always comes at a shock. I cant take pictures of myself, I can barely look in the mirror, because I hate what I see. I was required to submit a picture of myself for university and literally had a panic attack. I always give seeminglyaccurate reasons about not posting anything on social media, and I finally came clean to my boyfriend that every reason I dont is because I cant stand myself, and to be honest, I dont think he understood. Hes always been supportive of me and helping me get the help I need, but I dont think he is able to empathize rather than sympathize. I have this selfdisgust and selfhatred. I dont want to see myself in pain or hurt myself, I just dont want to see myself. Im conflicted because one side of my brain I am able to logic my way out of some spiraling thoughts... thanks CBT therapy but the other is just so dark and unforgiving and unrelenting. I thought my meds were working, and I think they are. I think they finally allowed me to see this a bit clearer, but Ive really struggling since. The thing is  I want to get better. I want to be okay, and I just dont know how. Anyone have any direction or thinks to think about?",
    "I don’t know what’s going on I was always the guy that never thought he would get depression you know. Honestly me even saying that I have depression makes me feel like less of a man, it makes me feel like one of those emo and edgy kids from school pretending to be depressed and in their feelings. Everytime I felt sadness or lonely I just take a break and go to sleep or just get back on the grind and try to push through it. But I dont know, lately its gotten so much worse. Two weeks ago for a whole week straight I had insomnia, and Ive been feeling lost, unmotivated, frustrated, anxious with everything. My life is falling apart because Ive been being unmotivated to do anything. And back then If I ever felt unmotivated I always thought that it was just a lack of discipline to do the things I dream and strive for. But lately its been different. Ive been in my feelings every night, and I sleep for more than 10 Hours daily. Im always tired, I feel lethargic, unmotivated, and I need help. I looked up what the things Ive been feeling could mean, and the Internet keeps suggesting I have depression. But I dont feel overwhelmingly sad, I just feel overwhelmed, stressed out all the time, my body doesnt just want to do anything. My Mind just wants to take a day off. I just wanna give up on life. No I dont want to die, but I cant bring myself to try anything anymore. I want to make D1 Soccer in college, but I just dont feel like it anymore to practice and train and so I deteriorate in skill and fitness. I guess this is Karma because someone told me a while back they were feeling the things Im feeling now and I just told them to step up and be a man, and kind of just disregarded the Possibility of them actually being depressed. Even then, I used to have a friend who was depressed and I told her to just stop being depressed and own up to her actions and feelings, I told her it was just a lack of strength and that she just lacked discipline. But I guess now I understand. And I hate it.",
    "Still hurting from betrayal I posted awhile back but I am still having trouble and I would appreciate the support. My 26M ex gf 26F cheated on me and left me for some guy she had only known for 3 weeks. I loved her so much. We had been together for almost 7 years. We had plans to get married and buy a home together. To travel together have kids and start a family together She abandoned me and the dog we raised together for some low life with no career or education that pursued her knowing we were in a committed relationship. It hurts. There are so many memories of the good times we spent together. I was so close with her family. She had always said she couldnt imagine her life without me. Now shes off with this horrible person acting like theyre soulmates. I know I deserve better than someone who would cheat on me and lie about it. I am just still having trouble believing she actually did this to me and that shes gone and never coming back. I was such a good boyfriend. I made her breakfast in bed and surprised her with dinner when she had a late shift. I would plan special surprises for the holidays and birthdays. Yet she still cheated on me and left me. I go from sad to angry to depressed to sad again. I dont really know what to do. Thanks for taking the time to read and comment. I know there are a lot of people out there going through hard times.",
    "Being in lockdown would be great if I was literally anywhere else Long story short while in the middle of a panic attack my dad threatened to have me sanctioned. If you dont know what that means, he told me he was perfectly comfortable hospitalising me against my will. Im terrified of hospitals. This was the day lockdown was put in place uk this incident was a catalyst for a downward spiral and Im now in a depressive episode. I have work due in under a week and I cant force myself to do it. If I dont submit I will not be able to get my degree. Im tired and experiencing some really bad thoughts. I cant talk to anyone irl about this apart from my therapist but my appointment isnt for another week. I dont really know what Im expecting from this but putting it out there and helps sometimes.

    "Is it possible to date when you're depressed? It feels really impossible to even attempt to find a partner when youre depressed. Dating apps are a pain and most of my matches I get either unmatch instantly, are scammers trying to get my money, or girls trying to get subscribers to their onlyfans which Im not against OF I just dont think a dating app is the best place to look for subs. Which makes me feel extremely ugly and only worth anything when I can give money to people. With dating you kinda have to sell yourself, but I cant. I hate myself and I dont see myself as attractive at all. And I dont blame people for not wanting to date losers like me.",
    "puberty? attention? depression? hello i am a teen who is going through puberty right now which is why i dont know if Im even depressed or what, if i am, then am i just seeking attention? everytime i think to myself that i might have depression, it just hits me that this is just puberty, im just seeking attention and whatnot, i feel really unhappy, i started wanting to eat less, wary of my weight i am very selfconscious and I cant sleep without using my phone to sleep, i feel like im such a failure to my parents who are trying to raise me with their best, i always tried my best to be a good child to them, not doing what they didnt want, but i felt like i suddenly changed, i didnt want to be a good kid anymore, following all the rules and having to hide whats not good within me, i just wanted to be who i am without trying to hide it from them like its such a crime, but I cant because im too afraid, i want to be honest with them and relieve this feeling off my chest but I cant, i always think theyll probably think that im just wanting attention, I dont want to be ashamed, i dont like the feeling of embarrassment, i just want to be alone, away from everything but i want to talk at the same time, its just that i always rethink it, when i think of talking with someone, my mind just rethinks everything and i eventually end up not talking with someone, so i wanted to talk here, with more responsible people than me I could also be probably just too self conscious, I dont know, im doubting myself with everything i think which could be the reason, making me not come up with an answer, Ive also been feeling empty for a very long time, i could laugh and be happy at times but it doesnt feel right, like theres something missing, i dont have any traumas that i can remember to be a source, im an introvert who dislikes social interaction and is comfortable isolated, i have thanatophobia which I dont remember having a trauma of either but i suddenly get panic attacks as if im being choked and my brain just goes blank, which i havent told my parents about either but i had a panic attack before in front of them which probably just seemed like i was just feeling unwell or something to them i think, i only remember it vaguely which is why i dont really remember what happened but I do remember them being passive about it ?, considering everything was completely normal and i dont remember them asking me why i acted like that, and right now as im typing, i feel like im making my parents look shitty even if theyre not and i know they dont deserve it and im just rambling stupidly like this but i felt like i just had to open up everything i hadnt told them since i developed bottling up my feelings instead of talking im probably better gone, but i dont want to leave my parents am i depressed or just over reacting?",
    "I've been feeling this way for some tine Im alway feeling like this. It doesnt even matter the age we are anymore. When we are feeling low its just that. Ive been dealing with depressionanxiety since I was 1213. It comes with just a long story that I was never able to overcome it. I tried to seek help and when she tried to suggest medication since I was already angry I just never went back. I just got to a point where I just say Im ok when asked HOW ARE YOU? Its just easier to say Im ok, than explaining how I feel. night time is the worst for me since Im alone in my room. Ive tried to text people that I was once able to do, but that turned out wrong for me so I guess I dont have that option anymore. Ive done things in the past where I am trying to avoid but as selfish as that may sound to others I found my comfort in that. I dont want to do that anymore. Finally admitted to myself that I cannot do this anymore by myself. This whole year has been a night mare for me but I still tried and I feel like kept falling deeper and deeper. Like being in a coma but with my eyes open. Like being in a crowded room and yet Im still feeling alone, boxed in, no way out. Ive become so afraid of being alone, that I am alone. Lost valuable friends, a great partner and I cannot get any of it back. I held back on telling people how I feel with the fear of losing anyone else. But that hold inside me makes it worse and I know that, but I dont want to lose anyone else. I dont know if I would, but that thought is just there. I feel as if I sleep walk awake. Sorry it just been to much. My heart beats fast, with just even writing this my head hurts from it all. I want to tell people how I feel the ones matter, but its that fear that hold me back. Dont know why or where this all came from but its been even harder to get myself together. Maybe I deserve to be alone. I deserve to not have you as my friend.",

    "I dont love/like my mother and idk if the relationship is worth salvaging. Another thing she been on methadone for like 13 years, thats not how methadone should work but fuck it im no doctor. 4 years later she makes a big deal about money and all this stuff and i go to find out that, first she never used my money to pay rent, it turned out from me talking to our landlord that she owed almost 6 months of backrent! I also found out that the boyfriend didnt contribute to any of the finances so at a young age she put her financial responsibility in my hands. We ended up getting evicted and I was pissed and didnt talk to her for 2 years then she got cancer. So i did what i felt was the right thing and was there for her regardless. She got better and now well this whole thing came from a argument the other day we had. I have major depression and i was trying to ask for help and she got mad at me cause i told her i cant talk to her about it. She asked why and i told her the truth that i dont wanna have a who had a sadder life competition. Because she has a habit of if i was to complain about my childhood instead of listening or sympathizing she would bring up things like oh i was molested my childhood wasnt that great. Yeah thats fucking terrible and all that but that doesnt excuse your decision for you children. Youre supposed to work to make things better for them. Which is the only valuable life lesson she taught me, because she never did it. Now im in a ok place Im in school full time work 2 jobs all so i can have a easier life, and she dont understand that Im busy even though i told her this. Honestly shes the reason for a lot of my depression. it sucks having to coddle a parent, i have no guidance i feel lost half the time and she will never understand that.",

I always thought Id be a writer, but since about 25 when I had a mental health crisis Ive had no inspiration barely the aspiration to remain alive for a long time, I just existed very depressed, in no small part because I was doing this same work. I have a college degree, but its a bachelors in Culinary Arts. Essentially its useless as anything but wall art, but it was important to me to finish college regardless of how depressed I was. The program gave me an easy couple semesters when I couldnt stand being. I always thought some inspiration would hit, or some brick would fall onto my head and Id see clearly what I should do with my life. I remember tearful prayers at 14, asking God for some kind of guidance that never came. I didnt know then and I dont know now what Im going to do when I grow up  35, in case you forgot.

    "Want go back to my life before all of this. Please help! How can I get over this obsessive fear of others opinions? It is ruining my life It is confusing, but I guess my fear isnt that I am a pedophile because Im not. I actually fear the possibility of me fearing that I am a pedophile... sorry if that makes no sense. I kind of deviated from the main point, but I think the root of all my fear, is from fear of judgment. I constantly worry like oh god, I had another groinal response.

I just find it hard to stop thinking about others opinions. I feel like if I were to describe my issues like I did above, so many people would think I am a horrible person. I dont want to be a bad person. But going through all this the intrusice thoughts, grounal response, etc. I feel like the scum of the earth.

It started because of work which I already resigned from 2 months ago.

    "Life advice help? So New Years just passed and I just went on a former close friend on mines instagram page and I was just on social media in general and before I even finish this, please dont give me, everyday goes through life at a different pace I noticed that her and other people seem to have actual lives. She performs songs plays, etc , has a relationship etc. and me? No guy had ever looked my way, my life is literally wake up , school, come home, homework, rinse and repeat. I also have social anxiety so its hard for me to go out and even then still, I think Im grossly unattractive. Have never ever taken a good picture, last picture I took was for the school yearbook months ago. I simply just dont take pictures. I feel behind everyone and everything. I realize how at my age this decade is literally the decade on change for my generation, but I havent dont anything. Never been kissed, held hands, complimented, looked at. And it doesnt help that Im a dark skin girl and nowadays boys and men seem to go out of their way especially black men, to point out how they believe dark skin girls are unattractive in all ways. I just feel behind. I mean the girl I was talking about was the girl I did everything with in elementary and middle school till we moved for high school and she had the most basic things that I cant even get. I mean high schoolers get to yall about relationships, and me, Im here too ugly to even be given a second glance. 2020 is off to the worst possible start.i want to be someones first choice. I have friends but I know Im not their first choice, I feel like the leftover friend. I feel like if life is literally not happening for me, I shouldnt even be alive, whats the point. And I release that yes I need to go out there, but how do I do that when my head is constantly telling me all my flaws, from the shape of my nose to the darkness of my skin, to my introverted personality.

    "Starting a new job with depression Im seeking some advice. I recently started a new job. Im suffering severe depression at the moment which has worsened after a breakup bit of background, Ive suffered from depression on and off for the last 10 years. Unmediated right now  thinking of going back back but afraid of going back to my old cycles. Ive been in some very dark places recently and have regular ideation. Im okay right now  Im lucid and not distressed or apathetic to the point of wanting to end things. As mentioned, I recently started a new job. A promotion in my current company. My HR team is aware of my history and medical record. But Im finding it hard at the moment to settle into my new role. Im swinging between showing enthusiasm and working to prove myself to complete apathy and disinterest in any kind of future it might bring me. Its making things really hard for me. Its like a part of me doesnt care at all, even though the doors are opening for me to do the things Ive wanted to do for such a long time. I cant seem to find any kind of joy. I feel grateful to my new boss for the opportunity and I know Im just onboarding so its still early but theres a part of me that doesnt care if I crash and burn. Its like Im waiting for it. I want to keep fighting and find myself again but I dont know how. Has anyone else dealt with this? Any helpadvice?",
    "I don’t have anyone to talk to and I don’t know what to do anymore Nine years ago I was diagnosed with depression and generalised anxiety disorder, Six years later I was also diagnosed with PTSD due to sexual assault trauma, and finally stopped living in denial and got a formal diagnosis plus started treatment for anorexia nervosa. my lifes kinda been a train wreck for the most part. I always remember being deeply sad with an overly critical and hateful view of the world around me human kind are doing nothing productive for the earth and it would be best if we walked hand in hand to extinction to save the planet kind of hateful or for some periods of time feeling like Im buzzing with happiness, in which times I felt unstoppable. With my first diagnosis, my first set of meds followed, I trialled quite a few over the years but when I decided they didnt work for me I tried self medicating with anything I could get my hands on and ended up with major substance abuse issues. Ive now just managed to get myself sober and maintain it for the last month. I feel as if Im being sucked into a giant pit of despair I cant get myself out of and Its progressively getting harder to leave bed. I get panic attacks before and during leaving the house because Im terrified someones going to hurt me. I only go out to get groceries and even then sometimes I get there, panic and cant leave the car so I just go home. I cant sleep properly anymore due to horrible nightmares. I can never shake the feeling that Im a giant burden to everyone in my life so I cant talk to them about when Im struggling. Ive isolated myself so much over the past few years I dont have a single friend left. Id like to try medication again but Im too terrified to try anything and have panic attacks thinking about taking something to shut up my mind in fear of getting addicted and out of control. Has anyone else struggled with this? What helped you overcome it?",
    "I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to keep going I posted yesterday, but things keep getting worse. So my spouse and I were given a 30 day move out notice because our depression mess was too much for them. Its not even thats bad, and weve been actively trying to get better, but they wouldnt work with us at all. My spouse called her mom today to wish her a happy birthday and her mom ended up asking a bunch of questions about our plan and what were doing, and my fiancée broached the subject of her possibly taking our cats. Her mom proceeded to freak out at her and say that she was being disrespectful and then yelled at my spouse for being manipulative when she started to cry. She then said that if we really cant find anything that we can move in with her, but obviously thats not something that any of us want. My spouse is currently sobbing in the bathroom, barely able to move, and I just feel so utterly fucking helpless and afraid. She told me that she wants to kill herself so fucking bad but that she cant because that would be unfair to me. I worry every fucking day that this will be the day that her will to live outweighs that guilt she feels for leaving me. I have for a long time. I used to come home when I worked an earlier shift from her and check the closet to make sure I didnt find her hanging there, and that was even when things were going relatively okay. I dont know how were supposed to do this. How do we get an apartment if were being kicked out in the middle of our lease? No one will want us with this on our record. Im terrified of if we have to go to her moms. I would suggest that just she move back in because I think part of her moms issue is with me and I find a couch to crash on until we can figure it out, but I worry that her mental state would get worse being at her moms without me, dealing with her mothers emotional abuse every day. Im terrified. I feel like Im spiraling out of control. My spouses mental health is so much worse than mine so Im the one who always has to be strong and supportive, but Im losing it.",
    "I ruined my life In about a week I lost the one person who I truly loved and counted on, dropped out of university, and havent been eating, showering, or taking care of myself. This was all my fault, and I know I deserve to be here. I feel worse than Ive ever felt now. No I dont want to end my life, that wouldnt help anything. I just have to come to grips with the fact that I will live a miserable life from here on. I deserve this. Im pathetic, a lazy, awful person. I think today this truly set in. Now that Im truly alone I have to sit with myself. I have to feel this pain. This is what I deserve. I dont know why Im posting this. I doubt theres anything someone here can do or say, but I have hope.",
    "I'm losing my mind and need help. I contemplate suicide everyday. I don't see any future anymore, just think I'll kill myself one of these days. I am sick. I contemplate suicide everyday, but what ultimately stops me is just the possibility of a failed attempt, and getting scarred for many years to come, and always under watchful eyes after the attempt. The hurdle of death is my prison.",
    "I don't know why I feel this way I pulled out my notepad and no words come out of me. I tried putting myself in front of my piano, but I cant bring myself to even play a full piece. The one that Ive tried is mediocre at best. I cant pick up a book. I cant bring myself to enjoy the foods I eat. I dont even know why I feel this way. There is no reason for me to feel this way. I have a roof over my head, a loving family, and supportive friends, yet why do I feel this way? There are people that say they love and care for me, but why cant I bring myself to pull up the phone to say Hi? I know theyd reply back, but I dont know why I cant do it. There is a voice in my head that says they hate you. They never cared for you. They only tolerate you because they see you as a sad being. I know its not true, but why does my mind work against me? And now, Im lying on my bed. I dont even want to do anything. I just want to lie down and try to sleep. I cant even do sleeping right. Sometimes, I sleep too much. Sometimes, none at all. And all I could do to shut my thoughts to play is some mindless video or song. But I never really enjoy it. The saddest thing for me is... I thought I already survived it. Ive been out of my medications for two years now, and yet, here it comes again. I dont like feeling this way. What does it feel like to not have a noisy brain that feeds me with depressive thoughts? Its like every waking moment of my life, it has something to say. And I hate it. I just want to feel genuine happiness again.",
    "9 days sober and losing my mind I have given up all illicit substances, not for any inspirational reason, but because I am miserable at my job and any potential new job is going to have a drug test. Ive interviewed at several places that say I would be a perfect fit but keep falling through on their end. I have been extra low these past few days due to my own depression, miserable job, chemical swing from sobriety, and family stuff, all happening at the same time. I am trying so hard but every day I want to get high off my ass. My brains rationale is that because Im doing so poorly I deserve to get fucked up. I am trying to break down this idea bc it doesnt benefit me. I am doing my best but my best is just so so so shitty compared to any average person. I want to get better. Getting a new job will help a lot but obviously not solve all of my problems. I just need a reason to keep going. And I cant think of one. Im so sad and anxious and I just want to get high. Any support or suggestions welcome. I feel like Im falling apart.",
    "I don’t know why I’m seeking help here but please just read as much as you can... Any sign to help me know whats wrong with me because I want to seek help but I dont want to tell my parents about it and have them tell me Im just going through the teenage stage of life, and then have a doctor tell me the same and make me look and feel even worse. At this point I dont know what Im talking about but I just dont want to keep feeling like this. If this isnt depression then I dont know what to do because I dont want to have to deal with this horrible feeling in my body anymore.",
    "I’m dying inside 💔😩 I wish I could stop all this major pain I feel. I want to impress but I also could care less about who thinks what. I wanted to make you feel proud, but we see how that went for all of us. I try hard everyday to make myself proud of my achievements but its just not worth it as much as it used to be. I used to be so proud and so excited to try my hardest for the things I loved, but notice that all of a sudden it doesnt seem to matter anymore kills me. Where did all my friends, family and love life go. Down the drain it feels like. So where do I go from here, do I keep trying or do I go get help bc I just dont feel like I can do much of this alone for much longer. Do I give up completely? To feel so damn alone is crushing me and to feel I mean less and less every day isnt exactly healthy. You wanna know how I made it out of my moms hell hole psycho rage house. Ill tell you, Im forever damaged and looking for full approval on things. I only end up attracting the worst people and I cant seem to keep a solid person in my life bc she ruined my way of judgment. My aunt tries hard to fix what I cant even fix myself. I just want to feel loved by friends and someone I hold so near and dear and care for. But to do that, I HAVE TO HAVE FRIENDS, and NO ANXIETY ABOUT MAKING FRIENDS, AND SOMEONE NOT HURTING ME. I fear everyday that Ill fall back into my old habits and go suicidal. I almost want to know what its like to do drugs and get away from this world. I feel the pain rush through my body like electricity. I practically enjoyed that one girls night that I got so wasted that I was slurring my words for once and passed out naked in my own house. I enjoy darker things and its getting to dark to decipher whats ok or not anymore. I hold in so much anger and pain that If I let it all out Id probably cry for a week straight. Sleep cry sleep cry, it would be the worst cycle.",
    "is it time to see a therapist? for years friends and family have told me to see a therapist and get an explanation for my behavior. i grew up in an abusive household where me and my siblings had to repress our emotions to keep the peace and avoid being gaslighted. now years later these emotions are coming out. i find myself having depressive episodes from late november to early march. this has been going on for 5 years now and they get worse. during that time i deal with mood swings, awful anxiety, memories of sexual abuse, and leaden paralysis. as well as paranoia. in the most recent episode i started seeing my face drop and my hands melt with the room going sideways. to be honest i am afraid to go to a therapist because i am afraid to face the truth of whats going on. is it really necessary?",
    "I hate winter My therapist and I even had a 15 minute discussion about how winter is just awful. Now I dont mind looking at snow. The visual aesthetics are absolutely appealing. A white Christmas is great. I like chucking a snowball at my boyfriend. And hot chocolate is my favorite. However, why is it so fucking dark? Sunset at 5? Are you kidding me? Im exhausted, time confused, miss the sun, and I swear to God if it rains again at 40 degrees, Im hibernating for the rest of the year. I hate driving in the dark. I have to go outside to get to the basement to do my laundry, which thanks to last nights snow, means going through an inch and half of snow, on top of cold mud, into a rocky cold basement at the bottom of some rickety ice covered steps, just to put something in the washing machine. We have multiple cats, so I have to dump cat boxes daily, which makes a daily run to the trashcan, now in the dark. Driving in the dark. I hate how dark it is. I hate that it looks like midnight at 6 pm. Its just absurd. How do you all survive winter without living in a cocoon of blankets on the bed? Side note, yes I am aware of S. A. D. S, but I have no medically confirmed diagnosis of it currently, though its possible. Confirmed major depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder. TLDR HOW DO I KEEP SANE IN WINTER? ?",
    "I got kicked out of my house six months ago, and the only thing keeping me alive is fear, work, and my boyfriend. For context Im 20, F, and very new to Reddit I got kicked out of my house in late September, about a week after I graduated cosmetology school, due to an argument I got into with my step dad that resulted in him screaming, threatening, and punching the wall behind me. After two weeks of couch surfing, I bought a plane ticket to California from Texas with the last of my money, and moved into my best friends families home. Its been six months now and I constantly feel like I should just give up. I got a retail job at a company I had previously worked for within about two weeks of me moving, and other than that I havent done much else. I dont have a car, I havent looked into going back to school or pursuing any kind of education, Ive had a couple of falling outs now with the friends who encouraged me to move here best friend who Im living with included, and my relationship with my family has never been more toxic. The only thing that is holding me together is this job, my boyfriend whos been doing his best through out all of this, and being too cowardly to commit to killing myself. And I hate that Im posting all of this because it feels like such a pity party, but I dont know what to do anymore. I dont know where to go to get help, but I do want to.",

    "Feeling Super Stuck - Would Love Some Advice Hey guys. Im posting this in the depression forum because Im hoping for some advice from people who know what its like to live with depression. Im stuck in a bad situation with no good options, and I think it would be difficult for anyone without including severe depression and anxiety, but Ive got that too. Also, I just think I need some compassion and understanding right now, and so this feels like the right place to post this. TLDR Im a Canadian living in Houston. My wife is finishing up her surgical fellowship, and because of Covid, getting my US work authorization is taking forever. The combination of unemployment and being in a toxic relationship has left me miserable and fighting with depression and anxiety. If we didnt have a two and half year old daughter I would have split with my wife a while ago. Without employment I cant afford to get my own place here, and staying in this relationship is killing my soul. Im feeling insanely stuck  any advice? Long version Im living in Houston with my wife and two and half yearold daughter. My wife is a surgical fellow, and is currently deciding on which of the three job offers she has to become a full staff doctor in one of three US cities. I sold my business back in Canada earlier this year, and because of Covid and probably the existing general slowness of the US government, getting my US work authorization is taking forever. Im likely going to have to wait another three or four months until Im able to work, and at that point Ill still have to find a job. Unfortunately, as soon as my wifes current job is over in June, Ill have to stop working immediately, and will have to reapply for US work authorization again when she gets her new visa issued. So optimistically Ill be able to work for four out of the next 12 months and while Im a highly qualified person, I may not be able to find a wellpaying job right away. Working remotely for a Canadian company is possible, but those jobs pay poorly and theyre surprisingly hard to come by. I grew up in an abusive home, and was abused basically daily from about the age of four until I left at 16.",
    "I’m afraid of starting antidepressants. My depression has gotten much worse in the past couple of months. Ive been seeing a therapist for a while now, but more recently I asked my psychiatrist starting an antidepressant. We both agreed it would give me the best chance of seeing any improvement that I have at this point. Heres the thing though, Im really nervous about taking them. Im worried Itll change me in some negative way, or significantly change my personality. So Id really like to hear from others about their experiences on medication, hopefully to get some reassurance and help me feel a bit more comfortable about starting something that could possibly help me a lot.",

    "(TW: Suicide) I can’t stop thinking about my suicide attempt I attempted suicide earlier this year, and I cant stop thinking about it even though it was a while ago. I overdosed the day before my dads birthday I wasnt thinking about the fact that his birthday was tomorrow and was sent to the hospital at about 1am on his birthday my friend forced me to tell my dad what I did when I tried to vent to her about how much pain I was in otherwise shed call 911. Im glad she did. On the way to the hospital, my dad yelled at me for ruining his birthday and told me Im selfish and stuff for attempting suicide. He told me later that he did that because he was scared and didnt know how to react, but I still feel awful for ruining his birthday. He spent his birthday in a hospital with me. I cant stop thinking about being in the hospital and the mental hospital. It was horrible. Memories keep coming back to me and it makes it hard to sleep or focus. What should I do?",
    "Post-divorce depression Hi Im 38 and male. I had a divorce 6 months ago. The divorce was not my choice , but relatively friendly , I dont see the point of staying with someone who doesnt want to be with you. But in a way that made it even worse .. because it just feels like she gave up on our relationship. Since then Ive gotten more and more depressed. Im originally from Costa Rica , but studied and worked in the US where I was very successful . When I was 32 I decided to move back because I wanted to start a family in a place with more permanence and better worklife balance. In order to do that I took a very big paycut and work at a job that isnt really that challenging for me. Everything made sense when I was getting married , but now Im divorced, we didnt have kids  a big part of the breakup despite no medical reason for it , and both of us trying  , and I feel like a professional failure when I compare myself to my friends and family who continued their career path. Im turning 40 in a year and a half and I just feel like I wasted all my 30s. Im having a really hard time planning for the future , I just dont have any goals anymore and feel like I cant get excited for anything . If I think about things objectively I know I have options . I can try to change jobs maybe get a second masters and get a two year work visa to the US or Europe to get back into the workforce . But I have no energy or motivation , maybe Im just afraid of trying and failing again. Part of me just wants to give  up. Dont know what to do , I feel stuck .",
    "I cannot see a bright side or way out of my situation right now Im a sophomore coming to the end of my second year at this school and I have made zero friends, done zero things with anyone since welcome week freshman year and have only spent two quarters on campus. And by the time I graduate I will not have spent a full year at SCU. COVID cut off freshman year, obliterated this year, I will get to do study abroad next year which im very grateful for yes but it does have its downsides, and then senior year Ill graduate in the spring. There will be zero time for me to make any friends at SCU. I only have one quarter next year to do it in person before being gone until the next fall. How the hell am I supposed to make any sort of meaningful friendships or experiences in one quarter if Im a stupid introvert. Im gonna end up looking back on college the same way I do high school, four years of skirting the edge of fun and seeing everyone else have what I cant. I hate it, its crushing me. Theres zero hope for me, I will not have a fun college experience. Others will make friends theyll be friends with for years, Id be lucky to make one for a day. I hate it I hate it I hate myself. Last year in the spring I talked to someone about feeling like this, and they said dont worry, I made most of my friends my second year. You have plenty of time and that gave me hope for a bit but thats gone now. I didnt make any friends last year, none this year, Ive got one quarter to next year. And by senior year everyone will be in their groups, on their way out, reminiscing about fun times I can only daydream of. And now is find myself reading rSuicidewatch incessantly. Im not gonna kill myself but I cant stop bringing it up in my head. Sorry to rant like this but I was going crazy keeping this inside my head",

He suddenly said he lost feelings because of his depression and he tried to get them back but it never felt the same as it did before. Is it his depression that is making him feel this way or is it reality? He said that he doesnt know how long it will take to fix himself and he doesnt want me to wait for him because it isnt fair for me. I love him and Im willing to wait because his parents are the reason for his depression. When he moves out he will def feel that baggage left from his mind. He even hates them and is upset that he has to stay with them the whole summer before college. He even got drunk with alcohol because of his depression. And he never did this before. Do you think he actually lost feelings or that his feelings are being concealed because of the severe depression? He said he did love me before and a part of him still loves me now. But then Im confused because he told me to move on because its not fair for me to wait. Like i really love him and thats why im willing to wait.

Hello, Ive 22F struggled with my mental health since I was young, I was bullied when I was a kid and developed social anxiety because of it. Then I became depressed in my teenage years, but got better when I was 20. Ive never been good at interacting with people, due to my anxiety I find it really hard to talk spontaneously to people, but at the same time I can get defensive over anything, like I feel people are attacking me or trying to make fun of me but in reality theyre just joking around. A lot of people dont like me because of that, I seem really mean but Im not, I wish I could be friends with people like a normal person but I just cant. Lately Ive been having good days and bad days, but exaggerated. When Im having a good day I feel amazing, Im productive and do a lot of things. But in my bad days I feel way too bad, I was clean from self harm for 4 years and I did it again like a week ago. When I feel bad I also cant stop thinking I want to die, I feel like no one will ever like me, Ill never get a job because I run away from good opportunities because of my anxiety. I just want to disappear but I dont want to kill myself because I dont want my family to suffer. TLDR I dont know if Im depressed or not, I have motivation a lot of days but some days I become suicidal and I think its all because of my anxiety",
    "Prescribed lamictal for depression? Hi everyone. Apologies for how long this may be. Has anyone been prescribed lamictal for depression WITHOUT having bipolar disorder, along with suffering from low testosterone? A bit of bs  my SO was prescribed lamictal to combat his depression which is also very likely triggered by low T, which we are in the process of trying to treat, and tapered up from 25 mg to 100 mg within a month beginning in June. Prior to starting it, his previous most recent depressive episode was back in December. After he tapered up to 100, within a week, he immediately had a major severe depressive episode and never came out of it. Rather than his normal highs, high level mediums, and mid levels, he bordered on depression the entire time. He began to withdraw completely throughout the entire month of July, and then hit a second major depressive episode that lasted about 2 weeks. Throughout this entire time, he began saying he no longer wanted to be here, doesnt have feelings for me anymore, etc. I urged him to stop taking the lamictal, and although he has reached out to his psych multiple times over the past few weeks, he has yet to hear back so he decided to stop on his own. Since stopping the meds a week ago, Ive seen flashes of the man he used to be coming back  but unfortunately, the medication numbed him to the point where he simply just doesnt want to be here anymore. Were not exactly sure what to expect from this point on  he keeps hoping that the longer hes off, that hell come back to what he was feeling emotionally but at this point we just dont know. Were still awaiting the results from other testing, but for now, were just circling the drain and its legitimately killing me.",
    "A happy lonely girl I have a girlfriend and she was diagnosed with clinical depression. She always seems happy, she likes to make corny jokes and we always enjoy each other. But there will always a day she will tell that she feels alone, that she hates herself that she cant even look herself in the mirror and says that shes a burden to everyone. It really hurts me everytime I hear those words from her. I always try my best to comfort her, even though Im not with her physically I will talk to her over the phone without hanging out the phone and watch her until she fell asleep because thats the only thing that I can do. Worst feeling is I dont know what to do or what to say to cheer her up whenever she feels that extreme sadness. Also even in regular days, she cant accept compliments. I love her so much that I want to be with her in always. I want to be her shoulder whenever she feel sad. I am not that knowledgeable about how to handle things like this so Im seeking some tips or anything that can help me help her in her battles. Thank you.",
    "i can’t stop hurting myself ive struggled with depression my entire life ive tried therapy and everything and i thought why not give travelling a go to try and help it or at least take my mind away from bad thoughts. the first two weeks were great as i was constantly occupied but here i am now currently in Nepal ive been in my hostel almost everyday depressed and on the verge of crying for no reason. i picked up a cheap combat type knife from a trekking shop the other day and since then i havent been able to stop cutting myself to relieve the stress as i have no other form of medication or therapy here, i am extremely unsociable and i cant talk to people its just a personal trait so i cant attempt to make new friends as it makes my anxiety go through the roof. my flight home isnt for another 2 weeks and im just watching the days go by.

    "How do I gain confidence when almost every person I've talked to has put me down for my appearance? I feel so fucking hopeless, even though Ive been working out, trying to gain some healthy weight and muscle, naturally a quiet but nice person who genuinely cares what people think and how they feel. Been adding protein and healthier food options, and attempting to add more daily calories to my diet as to help me look less skinny and more healthier and fit. But at the same time its honestly for nothing, Im worthless and people make sure to remind me of that. I dont know how I was placed on this earth for basically every single person Ive spoken to, to make me feel like a worthless piece of shit. Im only 19 and I feel so fucking ugly, Ive been told by the nicest prettiest girls that I, Look like an old man. on multiple different occasions. Do you realize how fucking painful that is? Imagine if I told that same girl, You look like a 50 year old lady. I fucking guarantee you shed have been heartbroken from hearing that. How the fuck am I the only person in the world who thinks about how my words can possibly hurt someones feelings? Am I the only person who thinks before they speak? My own family has teased my appearance including high school teachers. Ive heard friends of mine overhearing teachers making fun of me behind my back. My OWN friends make fun of my appearance straight in my face. Its impossible to have self confidence when youve literally been proven to be fucking hideous, people dont tease me to share a good laugh. They do it because Im genuinely ugly and nobody cares about how depressed I am and how I have literally not a single person to talk to. I cant get suicide out of my head I dont wanna live with other humans if theyre just gonna make me feel shunned and worthless. I really dont know what to do. Ive tried to make myself the best person I can be but nobody gives me a crumb of appreciation. All my hard work literally doesnt mean anything to anyone and nobody cares. Sure Im doing all this self care for myself, but I need to feel accepted by someone.",

    "Not sure what my passion is and feeling lost Im posting this here because Ive been in and out of depression most of my life. I feel like Im slowly getting out of the hole but Im confused in that I dont know where to go from here. People say to find your passion, or do what you love, but thinking about what my passion could be makes me feel even more lost. Ive always been a jack of all trades type of person, and I enjoy a little bit of everything. But nothing comes to mind when Im asked what I like to do, or what my ambitions are. I guess Im overwhelmed with the thought because I feel like I want to do everything. I have no idea where to start, and I dont have any energy or motivation to get started. Does anyone else feel this way? Can someone recommend how to choose a path and find motivation to follow it? What are things you can do to avoid getting sucked back into depression?",
    "Please Help: Spontaneous Suicide Attempts - 25 y/o Female My wife 25 year old female whom Ive been with for 8 years, recently attempted taking her own life for the third time. I was lucky enough to notice something was up, and prevent the act. When she isnt in a depressed state, she is smiley, friendly and she even manages to excel as a grad student at a top school. She has been battling with bouts of severe depression and suicidal ideation for her entire life. These depressive episodes never seem to correspond to events, but come on spontaneously. I think its also worth noting that her biological aunt committed suicide when she was in her 30s and it was also unexpected and didnt seem to be related to any specific occurance. The first time my wife attempted suicide was in college. A friend called 911 and she was briefly evaluated at the ER and then released I think she lied about her real feelings. A few years later, she suddenly told me one day that she felt she needed to be admitted immediately for her own safety, and I drove her to the hospital where she voluntarily was admitted for about a week, and was finally set up with a psychiatrist. This is where things got a little bit better for awhile the psychiatrist prescribed some medications that really seemed to help, a lot. She seemed to get down less frequently, and she said that her depression was more mild and less frequent. She also said that the voice that tells her to harm herself was far less common. Her medications have been adjusted a bit over the course of a couple years Ive included the current medication regimen below, but unfortunately things are still far from alright. While her depressive episodes seem to be less common, she still has occasional, spontaneous serious suicidal ideation. Recently, she made an attempt in the middle of the afternoon that I was able to stop, and by that night she was smiley, laughing and back to her normal self. This latest attempt has made me realize that we are not out of the woods, and she needs more aggressiveserious care if she is going to survive. I asked her if she was fully honest with her psychiatrist about her suicide attempts and her ideation, and she admitted that she has downplayed it.",
    "I’ve been feeling down lately Hello reddit. I dont know if Im lazy or depressed, but over the past few weeks Ive been feeling empty. I feel so emotionally numb and I started to lose interest in things I used to enjoy, like playing video games. Im in high school, and Im so overwhelmed by homework because of the pressure that I have to do them perfectly. So much that I just dont want to do anything at all. My parents call me lazy, but I really dont know if thats true. So I looked up what depression was, and I was like yep, I probably have this, but my mind is going back forth from thinking Im depressed or faking it. Its confusing because Im still able to carry out tasks like chores, but at the same time I feel like I only do it because I have to. I also easily get upset over little things, like when my parents try to lecture me. It reminds me that Im a failure. A bad child. And Ill never be enough for anyone. Then I start beating myself up because of it, because that was my only coping mechanism. I would just punch my own arm or hand to release that energy. It hurts, but I dont care. I can still enjoy some things, like painting. But eventually that enjoyment goes away, and I go back to that feeling. I ruminate over past social interactions, and I just sit down and do nothing. Ive always been tired and lacked energy, but I think its because I dont get much sleep. But another thing is, I get hyper around my friends, which is why I have these conflicting thoughts about depression. Sometimes, I would unexpectedly start to fidget and do everything quickly, but that energy goes away when Im alone. My mood goes up a but all those thoughts and feelings come back eventually. I cannot afford therapy, nor want my parents to be involved. Im not an adult yet either, but I feel like I need help. Does this sound like depression? If not, then what is it?",
    "I need help with hygiene This is probably the most embarrassing post Ive ever made, but I need help. Ive been working my way through a depressive episode for the past couple months, and I thought I was doing fairly good with it, since Ive been showering fairly often at least every other day and eating at least once a day, but recently one of my friends messaged me privately to ask if I was okay, because the last few times he saw me, he said he smelled a strong body odor and it was making him not want to be around me. I immediately went and bought some mens deodorant since it tends to be stronger, but I was hoping someone might have a better way for me to combat this. Honestly Im just upset that I let it get bad enough for people to notice, and I keep wondering how many people have been choosing to just say nothing and deal with it. Any help that yall can give me would be great thank you so much for your time!",
    "I hate myself so much, I don't deserve to live I am probably the most disgusting person in the world, or at least I feel like that. I dont have many friends and that for a reason, I never grant people any success because I get jealous of it. I wish people unluck so that I can catch up with them, how pathetic. I think about peoples flaws and start judging them based on that. I develop a unnecessary hate towards them, gossip behind backs and more. I also feel like I dont really have any unique characteristics personality. Iam boring, I never have an own opinion, I just clinge to the opinions of those that I admire and plan on back stabbing them once im done with all the dick sucking. Iam just waste of flesh, i should have been aborted, and no iam not just in this mood at the moment, thats how I always feel, I realized it a long time ago but there is just not a cure for my hate jealousy and whatever sin from the Bible I embody. If God exists and if he truly punishes those who deserve it, than why am I not already dead. Also why cant I change, why was I born this way, why was I bullied so hard in high school, why am I gay, why could I never experience love till now?

    "I'm losing my mind and need help. I contemplate suicide everyday. I don't see any future anymore, just think I'll kill myself one of these days. Everything makes me irritated, or break down. Noise seemed to be the problem. Voices make me go mad, but even when Im alone and in silence I keep thinking about everything needing to shut up. The chatter is all inside my head, and it never stops. ampx200B I feel like sometimes I am already dead on the inside, and Im not really human. Just a shell o what I wanted to be. I started going out to partys and things, mostly just filling myself with alcohol, or Ill just drive around going as fast as I can. Hoping Ill be something else, hoping Ill feel. Ive had one relationship with a girl, that eventually ended. I loved her but after that I couldnt feel anything for anyone and no, not even her. I just ended up obsessing over her, even if I didnt feel a thing. Really tried after I started to get over her, and even tried with another girl, but even with all that I managed to bosses with her as well, and got called a creep and that I harassed her. The meds make me worse off. My sex drive is completely dead. ampx200B By the end of high school I have made some friends, but I end up isolating myself, and losing them. Im starting college in August, and Ill move to another city for that, but I fear that will only isolate me, and make me worse. I think that if I dont kill myself soon, Ill do it then. I see no real future past a certain point. I fear itll all colapse, and Ill truly break down. I fear Ill lose interest in my career, since it has already happened. I was going to study astrophysics, but after an episode I saw nothing in that. ampx200B Im going crazy, always suffering. Everyday is pain, and I just want it to end. I am sick.",
    "I am beyond Pissed of spiraling out of control and need someone to help sort me. I felt like maybe I was growing in the last 6 months. I made a group of friends I could talk to for the first time. A group that would hang out all the time have a great time and just do everything together. About 2 months in I opened up to one of them after having really bad day. They said I could always trust them and they wouldnt leave me. Here I am a few months later and they call saying that they cant come and talk to me ever when I need it. I told them I was overwhelming as a person because Im so depressed and negative and that they would want to be done and they would stop coming over when I needed help. I was told however dont worry I wont ever leave you alone but as I had expected I was right and now they are giving up. I am beyond angered and sad and frustrated that I put all of my trust 100 into this person who even has told me to open up to the rest of that group. But now the whole group has a slight fear of me because depression is scary even for people who arent actually depressed because they just dont know what to do sometimes. I am no longer treated the same by the rest of the group and the one I trusted with everything has left me in complete shambles and my mind is freaking out. I am not really sure how to deal with this stuff because I dont have much time to do things or the energy to do much for myself. Any suggestions on how to sort my head or at the very least I dont know just acknowledging that Im doomed as always would be great. Or just you know the whole yeah people suck nobody can be trusted everyone lies and nobody could ever handle the worthless person you are. Because thats what my head tells me right now.",

    "Low-functioning Depression &amp; Exercise Ive struggled with depression for quite a while now, and certain times I find motivation comes easier than others. However, for the past three months I have been at a very low point, I shower once a week and I struggle to brush my teeth and hair. Thats where Im at. Last July I started seeing a personal trainer for the goal of weight loss and I havent seen her for 6 weeks now. My mom is encouraging me to go back, for my mental healths sake, but right now I have no interest in exercise. Also, I fear that if I go back my goal of weight loss will prioritize over my goal of benefiting my mental health. I know I inevitably kick myself for not going back, but the dread is over powering my rationale. I would prefer to just to 10 minute workouts on my own in my pyjamas, but I know I probably wont. Personal training just seems like a lot. What should I do? If you have been or know someone who is lowfunctioning, has personal training been helpful? Or exercise in general? Is it better to start small when youre low functioning or just throw yourself in? I appreciate any thoughts and advice as really I only have my moms perspective right now and she doesnt totally understand the depressed brain. Thank you",

Only thing keeping me alive was a quick extreme manic episode where i was going insane. Now I just feel empty inside, my brain thinks its good this way and justifies all the things that are happening. Constant intrusive thoughts in my head and I feel like Im on a bad drug trip. This isnt really important, I just feel like venting a little bit. I might just force myself back into an extremely overly happy mindset and just distract myself as much as possible.

    "Staying POSITIVE is ALREADY hard and now I am the caregiver to a SUICIDAL FRIEND Hi guys, I dont know if this is the right forum for my overall mixed content. Im 23 F. And I need some advice on my situation. Appreciate it if yall could share with me your thoughts. To start off, I have both anxiety and depression. I know that with those 2, it definitely would be a roller coaster ride with my emotions and I am familiar with this as it is like a cycle that I kept having to go through. I would say that my depression is not as severe as my anxiety though. So back to my main story. Recently I have been busy trying to help a suicidal friend. I have known her for 7 years plus and am aware that she was suffering from depression. I always thought that it was going to be okay as time goes by but then I realized it worsened. She was really going all out on ending her life that I had to call the police on her. Thing is, she has been planning out her will and settling whatever she considered as necessity for the preparation of her demise. Its like i am scared but I have no choice to take charge as she does not have a good rs with her family. I managed to persuade her to go and seek help from the professional. She was adamant but somehow agreed eventually. First medication didnt work so we changed to another type. End up, she decided to stop taking the medication all by herself. She went MIA for about a week or so. When she finally texted, it was bad news  she was prepping to end her life. I had to call the police on her. Apparently she lied to them that she was okay and would be attending her appointment, so they couldnt do anything in my country the police can only intervene if you are caught in the act of committing suicide. However later on she berated me as she felt that I had betrayed her. She however continued to confide in me. I was pretty much unsure what to do so I wrote a letter to the family secretly I know where she stays and i made sure to text her mum that I had put a letter outside their house gate.",
    "Downward spiral after being dumped by someone who was never even my bf Im 31 F and have never had a boyfriend. I feel defective. After about a dozen dates or so I get dumped or guys start treating me like shit. I just got dumped by a really great guy. He said he wasnt ready for a relationship. Yet he messaged me first online, we texted almost daily for over a month, and went on real dates. I feel like this was the nice way of saying he just isnt that into me. He even met some of my friends. He told me I was the sweetest girl he ever dated. Then why would he never want to see me again? I dont have much experience considering most people my age are at a minimum living with their partner if not married with kids. I cant figure out why Im so undesirable. Its been like this ever since I was 16. I was always a secret. An embarrassment. I was doing so much better with my depression and now Im back at square one. Im randomly crying at work, I either feel intense pain or numb, I relive the act of being dumped and my stomach drops all over again, and Im seriously wondering if life is worth it if I never have someone love me. I take meds, go to therapy. But its not helping. Im overweight so I cant help but think some of the reason why my dating pool sucks is because Im ugly.

I didnt quiet leave a good impression at every unit i worked at, some told me that I should work on my structure, some told me that I need to smile more because my face always looks angry, and some told me that I should apply for a job at their unit because they thought I was good. I did apply, wasnt really confident that Im good at all but i tried my best to seem confident, because I figured that no one would want to hire someone thats not confident. I applied to meet someone thats known to be very nice and that would talk to students for at least 10 minutes and then offer them a job, but I was unlucky enough to have a meeting with someone else, Mrs. D. My meeting didnt go that well, she asked me a lot of trick questions and lasted for over 45 minutes, she also asked the why should we hire you and not someone else question 4 times because she didnt like my answer, come to think of it, I dont think I answered the question at all and talked instead about what this job meant for me. at the end she told me shed talk to my teacher and the units Ive been at, and give me a call soon. fast forward one month later, which was yesterday. I was invited to her office midshift. she sat me down at a table 2 meters away from her and said we could take off the face masks. then she offered me a limited contract for 6 months and called it my second chance, proceeded to tell me that the units didnt say good things about me and then told me that Im empathyless and that people arent machines or objects.",

    "I think I hate myself Sometimes I just do things to destruct my future self for no reason and I cant stop. For example I lie when its totally unnecessary and stupid, so that I later have to admit it or make up excuses, which is so uncomfortable. I also have a weird eating disorder so I overeat and dont stop even if it hurts and a few days after, I stop eating to kind of keep my body shape, because Im really insecure about that. I hate it but I wont ever change.",
    "I need help Ive always been the one to make a joke or help someone, but behind the mask, im the one needing it. I didnt want to do this but as I have thought more and more ive realised how much i needed to Im 15, had to grow up quicker than anyone i know, never even had contact with my dad and my mum has a disability. Yesterday she was told it is urgent for her to get scans as the doctors believe she may have bowel cancer. This broke me and has taken nearly two days to even hit me. I just dont know where to turn and who to talk to as i have always been that person others talk to and get help from I have been having bad days as it is probably hormones the last week and i just want to know if anyone will help me or just talk to me, thank you",
    "Looking at friends makes me depressed I dont know why but every time my friends posts things on social media, I just get triggered randomly. My emotions go from curiosity to sadness to depression and to wanting to kill myself. I dont understand what the hell is wrong with me. Im a pretty logical person and I usually know the cause of my mental health problems I dont know if its jealousy maybe but I dont think so?! I just feel like Im not good enough or that i need to be better. I guess in a way you could see it as fear of missing out but I like to stay at home a lot as well so Im not sure. I just really gotta fix this problem like theres no way I can avoid social media forever. I dont know how to cope with these feelings nor do I understand them. Please help",
    "Need advice o how to help my SO who is suffering with depression. Sorry if it's not the right place to put this. My SO is suffering with depression and anxiety and is refusing to get help. Its almost like he just doesnt want to. In fact he has said on multiple occasions that he doesnt want to get better. It all started when we had a termination for many different health reasons on my part. That was a good 6 months ago now. I went straight back to work afterward and he just didnt. All he is doing is burying his head in video games, he doesnt leave the house, doesnt help around the house or anything. We have been trying to get him to see someone and he just flat out refuses. He self medicates as well and I dont think that is helping at all, in fact I think it maybe contributing to the problem. But anytime anyone brings it up he just says that it isnt a problem. He did start to take some antidepressants but has decided that he isnt going to take them anymore. I know we cant force him to get help but he needs to do something. I have been trying to support him by giving him space and letting him do his own thing, but that just doesnt seem to be working. I just dont know what to do anymore. I am scared to bring any of this up to him as he just gets very defensive and nasty towards me just to clarify its not physical its just hurtful. Need some advice on what I can do to help.",
    "The Story of This Year Im a 22yo male and Ive been struggling with depression and anxiety since before I can even remember. I was put into the foster care system in Australia when I was 3 and stayed there till I was 18. Thankfully I didnt cycle a lot like most kids and I found a foster family who I now call my real family. Im having a really difficult time at the moment, this year had been really really tough. Im in my 4th year of uni and Ive failed the last 2 years because of my mental state, Ive been seeing counsellors and doctors and Im on medication. 2 weeks ago I got diagnosed with Bipolar II and now been medicated for that. But I just need to vent so Im going to talk about my year and hows its been the worst and best year Ive had in a very long time. So the best year started on the 31st of December 2018. I was at college by myself over Christmas and in news years eve I wanted to spend it with someone because I couldnt with my foster family. I invited 2 friends that were in my town at the time who came over. We sat and chatted for an hour and they started to get bored, my mate asked if he could invite a friend over to join us, I agreed. This friend ended up bringing a fair few people, I would say around 10. Me being anxious as all shit over everything in life, freaked out and stayed silent. I ended up having a few drinks and with each one became more confident and less anxious. Turns out these people were pretty amazing, I made a friend who was 7ft tall and he was honestly the big friendly giant. I made another friend who Ill call Max, we hit it off straight away and Ive never connected so well with someone. We instantly became best friends, he stayed over my place for an entire month until we decided to move out with 2 of our other friends, one of those who was homeless and was desperately trying to find someone to live. A little back story before we get rocky, I lived at a university where at the time our flat 8 bedroom house sorta thing was located on campus. All 8 people were and still are my closest friends. They are a very important part of my life and they mean the world to me.",
    "Should I even go to school? On Monday I have to go again into school and I just dont want anymore I cant complete an normal day every time I am angry and sad about myself I dont want to do anything and going to an place with toxic people and utterly boring tasks to do combined with anxiety about almost everything seems it so utterly unbearable to make I just want to stay in my room even if its till the sommer where I get my school graduation I cant take it anymore!! !",
    "Losing all hope Ive always struggled with depression, anxiety, alcohol abuse, and body image issues. Ive not had an easy go but always tried hard to better myself and get well. I got sober 1.5 years ago, am in therapy, regularly practice yoga and meditation, take antidepressants, get plenty of sleep, eat well, the whole fucking thing. I have a wonderful supportive husband whom I love, and with whom I had looked forward to building a life and having a family. And yet my depression still remains. In the last year, I have studied philosophy and spirituality and religion and cosmology and neuroscience and evolution and the more I learn the more I am convinced there is no benevolent god, the universe is random and absurd, and life is essentially meaningless. There may have been a creator entity, but its far removed from humanity. I recently watched True Detective and the main character says, I think human consciousness is a tragic misstep in evolution. We became too selfaware. Nature created an aspect of nature separate from itself. We are creatures that should not exist by natural law. We are things that labor under the illusion of having a self, this accretion of sensory experience and feelings, programmed with total assurance that we are each somebody, when in fact everybodys nobody. I agree with this statement entirely and had never heard anyone say it so succinctly. I have felt an urge to try and find some meaning in the world and in my life, that maybe I could climb out of the hole of depression someday, in many ways because of my husband. Until now. My husband is leaving me. He just started his dream job a few months ago, and hes suddenly decided he wants that more than me. That he wants to throw his whole life into work, and doesnt want to be married, or have a family, anymore. Note He is not leaving because I am depressed  he is leaving because he doesnt think he can be a good husband for me while he does this job, and this job is more important to him than I am. This pain...its just not bearable. It cuts to the heart in a way that is not describable.",

Its really exasperating to be so helpless, and so tired of my fked up life, and so sad, and no real prospects in paying my measly 100month bills. And when I reach out, it either goes sideways or I am ignored. I cant eat or I get very nauseous die to my anxiety and a medical issue with my stomach. Why dont I deserve the help I really need? I literally have nothing to live for. And I dont know what to do.",
    "Am I the Only One? Hi, Im somewhat new to the Reddit community but feel somewhat comfortable discussing heavy topics. So, please please dont be mean. I have dealt with depression and anxiety for a long time now but just recently got diagnosed and have been getting help for it. To keep it short, when I keep heavy thoughts bottled up inside for too long I explode. For me, I started cutting a year ago but havent done it in a few months but prefer to hit my face. Ive done this for a while but not to the point of leaving a wound. However, recently Ive noticed that I leave noticeable bruises on my face. I cant control the rage and feel awful afterwards but then i want to do it again. When it gets to a certain point, Im suicidal and tend to somewhat blackout when I hit myself. I hate thinking about this but it happened recently and now I have a bruise under my eye. Im reaching out to see if anyone else does this. Every time I do this, I wear a lot of makeup or stay home because Im ashamed and embarrassed that I did this to myself. I havent told anyone besides my boyfriend, counselor, and doctor so I dont know what others think about this. Only a few people have noticed a bruise on one occasion when I was in the darkest time and automatically thought my boyfriend did something. I felt terrible and I wanted to punish myself more. My boyfriend is one of the few reasons why Im still here. Any opinions and thoughts would be nice. I just feel so lost and confused. Thank you.",

Ive been struggling with anxiety and depression for years now and its gotten to the point where Im having suicidal thoughts and breaking down everyday. I feel really lonely. Thats the best way to put it, I feel that I annoy people so much that they just choose to ignore me. Different topic, but similar premise I think Im scared of my mom, I can tell she doesnt like me that much and shes said to my face that she has a favorite child Im not it Im afraid shes gonna hit me or get so fed up that she disowns me. Im pretty sure most of this is anxiety and paranoia, but shes hit me once before and she drinks fairly often Thanks for listening to me b Sorry for taking up your time",
    "Is This Wrong, or is My Mind Sabotaging Me? My depression really didnt manifest significantly until fourish years ago, when I was on my way out of high school. Having depression in college feels absolutely impossible. I find that I never have the motivation to complete my coursework and I lose interest quickly. Im in a degree right now that I thought would be good but now it doesnt feel right anymore. I just cant tell if Im unhappy because Im doing the wrong thing, or if my mental illness is robbing me of the passion I need to enjoy my program. But I dont have the time or the money to keep taking semesters off and swapping programs. I also dont want to realize five years from now that I fought through a degree I hated waiting for an improvement that never came. I just wish I could trust my mind to make the right decisions.",
    "At what point is someone ill enough to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital? Early this year, I tried to kill myself, and I asked my psychologist if I could be admitted to the government psychiatric hospital cant afford private so she she some research into it and they said that Im not ill enough. This time, I have a detailed plan with a guaranteed method of killing myself, theres no way it could fail, and a set date. But I want to go to the World Cup in Qatar next year. The thing is, as much as I want to go for that, the life that I face in the wait until then us quite horrific. Im going to be forced to go to university and I refuse to do that, but I know its going to result in massive fights with my family where Ill be cornered and ridiculed as a failure, and I wont have support support friends either because they agree that university is best for me. So Im wondering if I could perhaps find a way into the psychiatric hospital until its time to go to the World Cup so that I can avoid my awful life on the outside, or Ill be forced to kill myself and miss out on the World Cup.",

I really enjoyed it, but apparently I wasnt doing enough to pass probation which still had 3 weeks to go. Im nearly 30, and I started this job in January. It was the first time in my life where I felt like I had stable work, Monday to Friday 95 mundanity and I loved that. My partner and I had been going through a rocky patch, but with this stability came improvement. I have been in and out of work for the last 3 years, seemingly never truly on my own terms. She supported us throughout my instability even when things got hard. Now Im afraid this is undoing all that and Im scared shes gonna fucking leave, because Im a valueless cunt.

    "Has anyone else experienced these symptoms? My depression has always been severe, and I experience most symptoms other than an increase in energy and appetite. The worst symptom I used to have was intense pain in my chest as if someone were trying to rip out my heart. However, I just had my worst depressive episode ever, and it lasted for about a month. My symptoms were 1. Feeling as if I weigh a ton, and have immense difficulty moving 2. Nausea 3. Aforementioned chest pain 4. Tunnel vision 5. Blacking out Every time the sun went down, and sometimes during the day, these symptoms would occur simultaneously and in very high intensity at the drop of a hat. I never felt it coming, it was like a switch being flipped, and then I would suddenly be filled with the worst dread I had ever experienced and feel my head floating away from my body from the sheer intensity of the depression. Im not necessarily looking for sympathy, I just need to know if anyone else has experienced this as Ive never heard of depression getting this bad and am wondering if something else may be wrong.",

All I want to do is cry and lay in bed. But I cant shake this feeling my heart is literally throbbing as if I feels how sad I am. My own mother doesnt even like hugging me. She gets annoyed every time I ask for hugs and hug her. She always says you know I love you I just dont like being touched thats genuinely hurts me.

    "Boyfriend broke up with me a week after I got a shocking diagnosis, says my mood was too bad lately hi, frankly Im here to hear some motivational words. Ive been suffering from depression since I was a child, this was diagnosed by a psychiatrist. Ive been feeling better for a while. However, after I got with my boyfriend it definitely got better. Now last week I got the shocking diagnosis, that I might not be able to get pregnant naturally because of an undetected infection that I had at some point and Im going to surgery in a month due to chronic pain as consequence of this infection. Ive been really depressed, angry and frustrated lately. I just think that this could have been detected sooner, as Ive had pain in my lower abdomen for a while. On top of this, Im really stressed from university because I have to do a lot of homework and also work. My boyfriend of 2 12 months just broke up with me because he said that Ive been in a bad mood and he feels affected by this. I cant believe that he would just leave me at a time like this. Hes shown 0 empathy for my situation and always said I should stop feeling grumpy. I mean honestly. I moved out of my student housing room during the weekend to go live at my dads place during this difficult time and discovered that there is mold in my room now. I just feel like I cant catch a break and wonder how I can deal with this. Im so shocked because he always told me he loves me more than I him and that he really adores me. And now this. I mean its good that I know this now after such a short time rather than later. No one can use a partner that wont be there for them during difficult times. Im just having a hard time grasping this situation. I feel even worse now that he told me his reason for breaking up was that my mood had been too bad lately. I am afraid that I will be back to my major depression due to the course of these events. Im probably gonna phone some therapists soon so that I can deal with this situation better, as I fear that I might selfharm.",

    "I’m 15 and don’t want to live with my dad anymore. My parents have been divorced for 7 years and I go to my moms house weekdays, my dads weekends. The main issue I have with my dad is that I simply cant trust him. I cant open up to him without him rejecting my opinion. Growing up with him has made me feel helpless, and living with him feels like giving him all the control. He has threatened to take my phone because I said I value emotional relationships more than comfortable living. He threatened to go to court and call the police if I refused to go to his house. I said I wouldnt mind going for dinner and such, but he outright rejects my opinions. He said it wasnt my choice, and that just proves my point where I cant trust him to respect my feelings. He knows I have depression. He says hes willing to change, but I dont have the mental capacity to live with him if he doesnt change by himself. I live in BC Canada, so the age requirement for choosing who to live with is 19, but I researched about it and it said that the court will mostly decide for the childs best interest. Im terrified of the slightest possibility that my dad will win custody. At that point, I might as well kill myself. My dad is a negative influence, a toxic personality. I cut out most toxicity from my life because its caused me to be depressed, and its why I dont want to see him again. Im trying to compromise but I cant live with him. I just feel upset and terrified right now.",

I told him I was sorry and I didnt know but maybe it was because my son is more responsible than my husband has EVER been ! Then my son tells me and this isnt the first time that hes afraid to move out because hes worried my husband will get us in another fucking money bind and hes worried about his sisters. My heart doesnt know what to feel I feel soooo bad that he feels he has to be responsible for his sisters cause he knows his dads gonna fuck something up.

    "I’m lonely and depressed Then we were sent home. My friend and I who happened to be on two flights took some edibles before. We had to leave at 330, so we didnt bother sleeping before we went to the airport. These edibles hit HARD. Once I got to the gate wed be waiting at, I was paranoid. There was people around. These people might have COVID19. The seat Im sitting on might have COVID19. I cant escape it. It is everywhere. Whenever I heard someone cough, it felt like an impending bioweapon. But I was trapped in this airport and couldnt avoid it. I had a minipanic attack in the washroom. I got on the flight, and it was surreal. I hasnt really processed things yet. But I started to drift off to sleep, and saw myself at the house we were staying, with everyone in my volunteer group around. Then I woke up. And the whole world came rushing into me. I was on a flight. I was leaving. I was going home. I might not see some of those people ever again. My volunteer program experience was now in the past, and I couldnt change that. I wanted to cry. Its not like I even really LIKED everyone in my group. But after spending almost three months living with them, I was still attached to them. And it was hard to leave that behind. After a blurry 14 hours, I finally got to my home airport. My parents met me there and picked me up. I told them how things went, but its impossible to really communicate my experience. I got home, but realized I wasnt really home. Things were different. Society has morphed into a nightmarelike dystopia. Im not even allowed to see all my friends.

    "First-time depression Hi guys, its my first time on reddit. Im getting kinda depressed right now, mostly because of my disappointments. I put all my hopes and efforts into a competition and now that I failed my expectation was expecting a second prize but got a consolation one. More ironically, my boyfriend got a first prize which was kinda unbelievable and unprecedented in my school for the past 10 years. To make matters worse, he is entering university next year. Helping him with his academic profiles and scholarship applications made me really proud of him but concurrently selfpitiful. I feel a little inferior to him and constantly downplay myself without knowing how to stop. Both events struck me profoundly and Im confused as to what to do.

    "I think my boyfriend left me due to his depression and I need some help to understand and deal with this situation. tldr at the bottom Although I have more than enough mental problems on my own, depression probably isnt one of them. But it is the problem of my now exboyfriend. He isnt someone who talks much and I really tried to talk to him but its hard to get any real information from him and although he seems to try to answer me, most times the answer is some variation of I dont know. So I thought Id ask you guys if anything in my story sounds relatable to you and if you have any idea about the situation of my ex and can maybe explain the things he cant Of course I know that you can just make guesses but Im trying really hard to understand him and Im just so confused. We both have our own problems but as a couple I wouldnt say we had any major problems. In the last months his depression got worse and I tried to support him but more often than not he prefers to be alone when hes feeling very bad and then I just try to give him enough space. Thats why were not as close as I would have liked but this slowly improved over time, so I was patient. We didnt see each other for a month due to badly timed holidays and when I came back, he broke up with me. His reasoning was something along the lines that he thinks Im feeling more for him than vice versa and that our relationship was more like a friendship. Which I think is true and at the same time isnt... Its definitely not just a friendship, but because I tried to not put any pressure on him and let things be more casual at times, we werent already there where I would like my relationship to be. That was two months ago. Were still texting each day and sometimes meet  were not having sex or kissing but still, he doesnt treat me just like a friend and it seems like he doesnt want to. Were officially broken up... but were not just friends.",
    "I kill myself if you don’t read My upbringing only perpetuated my depression. My single mom never gave me responsibilities and I had too much free time. Making it worse I was a nerd so having the option to just stay inside and play video games was heaven. Years went by without speaking with anyone or trying to build relationships. In my teen years that was basically suicide because who wants to be known as the loner. So I would skip days to keep my fragile ego safe. Thoughts go by in my head that if I could just at the very least get over my fear for rejection I could get my life in order. Because having an intimate relationship would really solve a lot of current issues I have. And so Im actively looking subconsciously and consciously because i am starving for intimacy. I know how that would look desperate maybe a bit crazy. And its not about sex its about completely being open and honest with another person. I feel I can only be this intimate with a girl and refuse to open up to such an extent to the access of other human beings in my life. Because the human being in my life were not driven by choice ie family, childhood friends Im in a pickle and it sucks, but if it wasnt for weed I would not be aware of my issues, stayed positive and attempt to help myself. This is only a recent discovery ever since joe Rogan started talking about how weed paranoias actually help you figure out what is actually stressing you out. Thats the worst about depression, every action you do against yourself feels justified and logical. Its truly a terrible disease and I hope I survive this. Sorry about title Im just so desperate I apologize for my existence.",
    "I want to be happy again. Bought a vibrating dildo. But deep inside I still have that longing for intimate relationships with girl. I never had any. I am king of overthinking. I think of every consequence of my actions. Like where I keep dishes in kitchen. Opening and closing door. Even when I am walking down the road. Striking a lighter to light my joint. everything small you can imagine. This makes me mad and too conscious. I keep thinking of my childhood scenes where I lived with my parents and always wondering how time has passed. I was a kid back then and now I am an adult. I am so obsessed with age of people. How old is he or she? That actor? That sports person? and then I compare what I was doing when I was 16, 18, 23 etc. I am 26 right now. I dont check my actions usually but when I check them, they are bad. I am using same pair of clothes for months. Using same toothbrush for years. I have rarely gave any gifts to any one. I am not so close with my parents. I am single child. I lived in rented place for 11 years before leaving for another city for college. My parents finally have their own house now. We live with parents in India till death. I used to steal erasers, scales etc. from school. Even from my parents too. I have been caught sometimes. I now realized that maybe I was less satisfied with myself. I always felt less because all my relatives and friends had there own houses and car. My parents had one twowheeler and my parents used to fight with each other which used to make me very sad. When I used to watch other parents living happily, I used to think why I dont have that, why my parents are always fighting? This less feeling I still have with me. I still feel less. I am lazy for sure. Now I am sitting idle from last 1 year. No job, no friends, no personal connection with any human being. I never tell my secrets to anyone.",

Just cant find the motivation to study or attend online tutorials or go for wards anymore. I feel so tired everyday, sometimes I wish I would just die in my sleep amp not wake up the next morning. Nowadays, whenever I try to study or listen to the online lectures, either my head feels like its in a haze amp nothing goes in, or I get palpitations, breathlessness amp feel like puking. amp in the wards, I feel totally dissociated from whats going on during rounds. Im so sick the endless cycle of trying to complete anki reviews amp revise my notes, in addition to having to cram in new information that the doctors in the wards quiz us on amp say we must know otherwise well fail the exams.

Also, Im so scared Ill turn into a monster lose my sense of humanity because it hasnt even been 2 years into clinicals yet amp already, I feel numb to patients stories like every other history I take has been reduced to symptom complex gt diagnosis gt investigations gt management plan. Its so disillusioning to see the doctors in the hospital so jaded amp overworked that over time, the focus just becomes discharging patients as fast as possible amp documenting changes on computers wheeled around the wards to protect against legal liability. Some of them even talk demeaninglymake snark comments about patients behind their backs, amp while I dont expect doctors to be saints, especially given the tough working conditions, it really makes me question my decision to join med school.

    "I know what to do, I just can’t do it I know what I need to be happy. I need to stop smoking weed, I need to exercise, I need to eat better, to get on a good sleep schedule, to talk to people more, to actually open up to my therapist, to clean my house and do all of my work. Ive done it all before and Ill do it again. But I always end up back here. Square one.

    "Questions about taking Wellbutrin XL 150 mg, about 72 hours before I start Still, a destructive and potentially lifethreatening pattern comes up in my life, time and time again, and my psychiatrist, my mother, and others believe that Wellbutrin XL 150 mg may help. The pattern is as follows I feel resentful about people that have intentionally or unintentionally harmed me in the past, I feel anxiety and shame about my finances, inconsistent income that pays well when I do get paid and the cost of living in downtown Toronto, I feel anxiety, guilt, and shame about my partial dependency on my parents and a myriad of other things, I feel anxiety concerning many nuances of operating two businesses while starting a third, I feel anxiety, shame, and guilt concerning my lack of a dating life and sexual anorexiathe unconscious avoidance of dating, so I doubledown on activities related to my businesses, I doubledown on the seemingly beneficial and health activities that I previously mentioned, I work incredibly hard, going past my physical and psychological limits, I soothe myself by doing highvolumes of seemingly good things, I burnout, and then I become depressed, I experience suicidal ideation, and then I engage in selfsoothing by raging, ruminating about my resentments, having sex with socalled high end escorts aka prostitutes, and binge eating processed food. This pattern happens about once or twice per month it takes at least a couple of days to recover from, it is pretty destructive, and nothing that I have done since 2014 has put a permanent stop to it. I meditate every day, and I engage in the activities mentioned above every day, yet I often find myself in the same place. With that said, I have a few specific questions about taking Wellbutrin XL 150 mg, and I am hopeful that someone through Reddit will answer them for me, as the pharmacist that dispensed the Wellbutrin XL 150 mg could not answer some of my questions. 1. Meditating in sensory deprivation chambersfloat chambers for an hour or longer, after taking 0.4 g to 1.2 g of psilocybin psychedelic mushrooms, has been hugely beneficial to me for seven years, sometimes doing so is the only thing that gets me out of burnout.",

    "Nothing makes me happy anymore This year has been pretty rough for me. I had complications with an IUD I had put in and needed surgery to remove it as Ithe doctor put it in wrong. I had a scare with mold damage to where I was living, I threw out a bunch of clothes and had to wash everything in hot. I had a scare with bed bugs and had to freeze everything and dry in hot. I broke up with my boyfriend because he didnt want to see me anymore. I have had a lot of health problems and the doctors think I might have something serious I worry that its cancer. The only thing good going for me is my grades and thats because I literally put any energy I have that doesnt go towards aimlessly panicking and googling whatever my mind wants to worry over towards my grades. Lately I am in a endless state of paindue to my medical problems and I just dont feel happy anymore. I remember two years ago when I was actually happy and I was able to laugh at things or feel content. I just feel weird. My days are lonely... I dont have a boyfriend, family, friends,pets. My family lives far away, I wish I saw them more...but im too poor to travel. I just leave the house to go to school, come home, take tylenol then study. I got a scholarship which should have made me happy but I just didnt feel anything. My first thought was actually well if I have cancer this scholarship wont really matter. I keep thinking that im not going to live for very long. When people talk to me or try to make jokes I force a smile and it feels so weird because Im focusing on trying to look normal and happy so people cant see that im actually emotionless. How I am is starting to scare me a little bit like Im worried it might get worse. I tried seeing the school counseller but that didnt really help me as it made me uncomfortable talking about my anxiety.",

I downloaded Bumble the bff version to make friends but theyve slowly stopped talking when I dont message first I had tried to organise a friend meetup but it never went anywhere. I sometimes dont see anyone but my gf for weeks and its not for lack of trying. I do have friends but they all live in the city we moved from and have been really quiet. My supposed best friend has barely spoken to me in a few months. I just feel so lonely and desperate for friends. If I even had a job I could try making friends that way but its so, so difficult to get one. Theres no clubs or activities in this town other than the gym, and even then, with Covid, you have to understandably and rightly stay distant from everyone.

    "I feel like dying a lot I lost my job. They didnt even call to tell me. I had to find out myself by seeing I was removed from the company website. Chronic pain is really bad lately and my doctor is taking forever to get me treatment. My grandma died a few months ago. My dog died 2 months ago... i cant stop crying for her. She was my baby I mean that so much. It hurts so much nonstop. Im facially disfigured and make everyone uncomfortable. No one likes being uncomfortable so they avoid me. Its been a hard life and no one ever wants to know about it. I went thru so much, overcame so much and no one cares. I want a best friend so much. The girl I thought could become this, my old coworker, isnt going to be that for me. Im not mad. But it hurts a lot. I miss her and wish we couldve been closer. I really thought we could be super close best friends. Im so lonely, its like choking. The grief is so much. Insomnia is worst its ever been. Seeing a therapist. On medication. Not suicidal. So dont mention it please. Im so tired of people giving me suicide hotline numbers and saying see a therapist. I feel pushed away when that happens now. Im so tired of being ignored and invisible. I dont know whats so wrong with me for people to not want to be around me. I love life and living. But this is so painful and hard this year. I miss my old job where I was running the show and worked in a dream team with my mentor. Im working on building my own stuff all day everyday. It keeps me busy and my mind off depression.

Be less clingy I have always been the one dumped and I always have a hard time accepting it, probably easy to understand bearing into consideration the previous points. I have not much of a clue where to start from, however. I believe Ive seen people recommend meditation but I never was too sure about it, maybe I should give it a go? Or selfhelp books? Courses?

    "What happens when you get well? How often do you pop by the doc? Hi guys, I first went to a psychiatrist last summer. I had been selfmedicating something with tons of caffeine for years and wanted and needed to get to the bottom of why I needed large volumes of coffee in order to function the tipping point was having gallbladder surgery and caffeine being less of an option. Without it, there was an underlying tiredness and pessimism that wasnt shifting by itself, despite my best efforts at self care and healthy living. The past fourteen months has been the drug merrygoround Im guessing many here are familiar with. First tried every ADHD stimulant which all improved functionality like caffeine! but all literally every single one also made me more depressed. Then an SSRI which made me tired but more optimistic. Finally, weve moved onto Wellbutrin. Im wont to say wow, Im better! but I have a strong and positive feeling that this is going to be the chemical that shifts my dysthymia. Perhaps it will fizzle out. Perhaps Ill need something else. But .. after four weeks Im feeling optimistic and well in a way that I havent on anything Ive tried so far ie, Im more than just wired, Im confident and hopeful. My question now turns to okay, so whats next? Assuming that this is the drug for me, how often do you typically go to your prescriber just to make sure that things are working out okay? Is there such a thing as a yearly mental health checkup to verify that youre staying on course? Basically, once you finally manage to shift depression or at least get it to a manageable point ... what does the maintenance process look like?",
    "Is my \"popular\" intensive trauma program abusive/unfit/re-traumatizing for me? This was the ONLY personalized meeting I have had in this program  everything else was groups or front desk people doing questionnaires. 4 I have had no meeting with anyone during or before the program regarding what I need or how this program is customized to me. 5 almost every individual in the program is on medication and there seems to be general push towards strong sedating medication. Most members could not even sit up during groups due to the level of sedation. 6 I have corrected the clinicians and staff over 4 times in a single day with the name they use for me and they continue to use incorrect names for me. I dont feel respected. 7 The staff seems to treat every action of every client as a sickness. For example, a woman felt emotional anger when someone was rude towards her in public  the staff fixated on the validity or invalidity of that anger instead of the safety needs in that situation. 8 The staff and the program itself feels very paternalizing. Example  a clinician did an activity asking everyone to name vacation spots that start with F before jumping into talking about emotional dysregulation and severe distress. The clinician an intern in training had a color wheel with activities at the level of a 4th grader for an adult group. 9 The program is apparently owned by a forprofit company and has dangerously negative reviews on google by clients and on LinkedInGlassdoor by staff. ampx200B How do I navigate my care when Im feeling unsupported by the current treatment?",

    "Should I commit myself to a mental hospital? TW mention of selfharm suicide My depression has gotten really bad the past few weeks.

Not asking for pity I just dont trust myself to keep me safe, yk? A month ago I scheduled an appointment with my therapist, but her next available appointment is in another month, and I honesty dont know what will happen if I wait that long to get professional help. Im not saying Im going to kms but Im just scared for my wellbeing. I think staying at a mental hospital would really help me because I just want a break from all of the stressors in my life and I dont want to lay in my bed all day, which is unavoidable at this point. I just want a break from my life and the ability to get out of this mindset or at least prevent it from getting worse. At a hospital, there would be people to help me get better and keep me busy, so I think a mental hospital is the best option. I dont know what else to do, but I really feel like Im a bomb waiting to blow up. What do you think I should do? Im just indecisive and bad at trusting my own judgement. Thanks",

Im eighteen, 140 kilos and move out of the room I share with my sister into a unit with my boyfriend who, you probably guessed it, was abusive. over time he conditioned me to stay away from technology but the tv and Xbox, cut what few friends I had out, only family I could really see without some sort of manipulative guilt trip was my mother because shed drive me straight into his arms. He had control of everything, finances, time, everything. so now Im twenty three, married and pregnant with my first child. completely isolated and dependant. Police come aknocking when Im two months from birth and low and behold turns out my guy isnt a great fella. He had child exploitation on his Pc and planned to harm my daughter once she was born, sending photos and ultrasounds to prove intent. Oh but dont worry cause mummy was there to pick me up. I escape her when Im 24 and bubs nine months old for my own house but i dont fully shake her free until two years after that. Obviously as from all the above, I am not a mentally stable person. For my daughter I start to try and sort myself out. until my daughter is five, I took those years to do some inward looking and healing. I go to therapy, I find a antidepressant that works, I clip out the bad and keep only those positive influences. I have Depression, anxiety and PTSD. I have a medical diagnosis of only the Depression so far but the others are being worked on in therapy.

    "My “dead” line is coming up Its been a while that Ive posted. Not because Ive been fine but because I felt like it wasnt helping at all. But yet I find myself posting here again. A little backstory, I decided about 6 months ago or so that if I did not see any improvements in my life by July 10 I would kill myself. Well my deadline is coming up and honestly I have not seen any improvement whatsoever. If anything I feel worse now then ever before. I think Ill go through with it.

    "am i depressed or just overthinking? im 15, and it all started 3 years ago, back then o used to live with my dad with my step mum and my half brothers and my mum as well, but my dad would tread me badly. he abused me physically, emotionally, and sexually. but i dont want to go deeper into those parts. everyday after school he would always get mad at me for not studying i mean i did get pretty wacky grades back then but still, how could i stay motivated if even my own father brings me down? he would hit me if i get the wrong answers and say bad stuff. i remember this one time when we had dinner, my step mum was there and we were all eating in silence, i could remember that day like it was yesterday. he asked me if i did my homework and i just didnt answer, he then started yelling at me and he told that i dont deserve anything good in this world. i didnt know what to do that time, i sat there crying in the dinner table while my step mum looked at me with pity. she couldnt do anything and thats alright, i understood why. after dinner i ran to my room and i started cutting that day. after a few months my mum, brother, and i went back to my mums home country, i thought everything would be fine by then but i was wrong, 2 years ago i had no friends. i was lonely as heck. i have nobody to talk to. nobody to vent out to. last year i got some friends, but they werent the friends i really wanted. they kind of treated me like shit. and my aunt always gets mad at me for no reason, she tells me to go back to my father and it triggers me every time. she doesnt know what he did, and maybe if she did, will she change? a few days ago i had a huge fight with her. i cried and told her how i felt with the way she was treating me. but she didnt care.",
    "Any Support Group/Chat besides Wumpus? Hello All. I tried to join the Wumpus Discord group but the main lobby seemed hectic and was just random people saying random things. I am new to Discord  is the main lobby just generally not right place for support help? I tried looking through the other rooms therapy 13, advice 12, etc. and it also didnt seem to be really on topic. I tried to do the 11 support and there was someone who answered but after I shared, I no longer got a response not sure if they got busy, missed my message, or something else. This is my first time reaching out for some kind of support and Im feeling discouraged and stupid. Are there other groups or people or something out there? Late twenties F  any relevant groups?

    "How to help my husband not feel like he’s useless against my depression Ive been depressed for a long time now. Ive been struggling for as long as hes known me and it hasnt gotten any better throughout the course of our time together. Recently, hes been feeling like hes useless and cant do anything to help me when Im feeling really down and hes getting really frustrated. Needless to say this puts a strain on our relationship and how we communicate with each other. I dont know how to help him help me. Ive told him I just need him to be supportive and compassionate and loving but it frustrates him when he does that and Im still depressed. I think he understands that my mental health cant be fixed in a day but I hate that I make him feel like this. Has anyone been through something similar? How did you get throughmanage it?",
    "I am really struggling with people touching me Ive been having a pretty rough two or three months. This means even that I feel uncomfortable having my boyfriend touching me. I have talked to him about this twice how Ive been growing distant and disliking anything to do with touching he is a person who loves touch. It seems like even though Ive told him how bad it feels having someone touching me, he keeps doing it and it is starting to suffocate me. He is always asking why I dont touch him and stopping me to hug me or touch me in some way. This is making me quite irritable as well. I am waiting to get help from a doctor and see what I can do about it, but can you guys give me some advice on this? How can I get myself to not feel this way? Ive been forcing myself to take it for a while now and it just gets worse?",
    "How do you get past feelings of guilt? Hi everyone, Ive been recently wondering what to do to get past feelings of guilt over past mistakes and wrongdoings. I know that I hurt some close friends quite badly when I was severely depressed. Im not using it as an excuse for my behaviour, as I still said the terrible things and was unkind to them. Now, Ive looked at those mistakes, spoken to people and have been working to make myself a better person and hopefully a better friend to other people in the future. Given all of this, how can I get over the feelings of guilt over what was said? I know its not healthy to hold onto such feelings but at the same time, Im not sure how to stop thinking about those actions and feeling bad. Ive read somewhere that as we grow, learn and improve from our mistakes and to forgive ourselves, but I am not sure what techniques to try in order to do this. Thank you for reading",

    "What helps you with your insomnia? I remember how relaxing and fulfilling it was to sleep when I was a kid. I couldnt get enough of it! I slept with my blankie, I sucked my thumb, I snuggled, I was never cold when the window was open, and I hated having to wake up for school in the morning. At 14 I first got depressed and started experiencing uncomfortability during sleep I was always very cold. Then, at 18, I got into a depressive episode and with the pressure to study well at uni my social anxiety increased. I couldnt go out during the day because I felt like all the people around were judging me for not working hard enough, not looking well enough, and other things. So I started sleeping through the day and living at night. Now that Ive worked through social anxiety it is not quite so bad and I enjoy getting up early in the morning because it feels like the proper and healthy way to go about my day. However, no matter how much or how little I do during the day, I cant fall asleep at night. Im just not tired. Its kinda like leaving the car running Im not doing anything, but the thoughts are racing inside my head. Ive tried the 478 breathing technique, progressive muscle relaxation, but nothing seems to work. I also try to eat early and let fresh air into the room. What helps you to calm down before going to sleep? Thanks for the answers, I love everybody",
    "I'm depressed, my husband started to feel anxious about my condition Hello I havent feel myself in a while, all my days are blue. No objective, illusions, little things get to amused me, I dont like how I look, I feel like Im in a boat without paddles....spinning around with no direction. My husband tries his best to bring me joy weve been together 13 years, 1.5 yrs married, hes a lovely person. I love him so much but now my condition is affecting him, I dont know what to do, he started ignoring me and I understand, he needs his own space to think, but I feel bad because in my mind it feels like he is letting me drown. Tomorrow will be my first appointment with the therapist, Im so afraid of what Im going to discover, maybe Im crazy for real. Need your advise to make my boy feel good, I dont want him to be sad because of my fault, I feel that everything that happens around me is because my fault.",
    "I need help overcoming envy Everywhere I look is someone who is better than me at something, or someone who looks happier than me. I try to fix this by practicing at being talented at one of my video games so that I for once have something to be proud of, but no matter what I do I just end up getting frustrated and start insulting myself constantly saying Im pathetic and I dont deserve anything or anyone because of this. This is especially the case in pvp games, that kind I most enjoy when im winning. Even outside of video games though I cant help but to get envious of literally everyone, even if they have their own life troubles I dont realise. I dont know what to do from here, every attempt at saying something good about myself has failed and I feel like I cannot go a day on the internet without seeing something that makes me hate myself again. How do I get rid of my bottomless supply of envy and low selfesteem and stop getting frustrated at my life?",
    "I don’t know what is happening First of all, hello everyone and thank you for taking the time to read this. Ive been dealing with a lot of stuff recently and I think Ive done pretty good in regards how to deal with it but I still need some additional inspiration andor advice or you know, just someone who will listen because my friends have been listening to this a lot and I dont want to burden them with this any further. I was dating a guy from January until pretty recently and we were always on the brink of getting serious when he decided to distance himself from me because I think he was scared or something I dont blame him then in may I found out that I was pregnant 4w  3 d when I found out and I told him. He got extremely angry when I told him and that resulted in us having this really bad argument over if I should keep the baby or not and I was not budging because I thought it was in my best interest to keep the baby but then one thing led to another and I had a miscarriage the same day as I told him about the pregnancy and he seemed relieved that I had the miscarriage. But then yesterday I told him that I had to stop seeing him because I met a guy who treats me better and what not I hadnt talked to the guy I had been seeing for a few weeks so I assumed that it was over and he decides to tell me that he loves me he worded it like this even though its not in that way I love you and really care about you and I told him that I love him as a friend and that I really care about him too, later on he proceeded to tell me that he regrets how he acted towards me when I was pregnant and he now sees that we could have coparented well and that he wishes things wouldnt have happened like they did. I dont know how to feel about this because when he brought up the miscarriage I started to feel like I did when it happened because I still want that baby even though its gone and I know I can never get it back. Is it weird that I still want to be pregnant and is it weird that this chat of ours brought back the feelings that I had previously suppressed towards him?",
    "How do I get myself out of a rut/slump? How do I stop self-punishing myself? It seems I have been in a rutslump for five years and I dont know how to get myself out of it. I seem to be subconciously selfpunishing myself for everything that I view as a flaw. I dont know what hobbies I could do, It really frustrates me that I dont know what makes me happy anymore. I feel that my sister doesnt truly support me in my gender transistioning even though she keeps saying she does. It seems like her and I just have different love languages Hers is gift giving and mines is words of affirmation , and so it makes me feel like her vibe is inconsistent and that frustrates me even more. I have been constantly feeling terrible about myself and others, but I primarily take it out on myself because I dont want to hurt other people with my emotions. I am very tired of feeling like I dont like myself and I want to care about myself...but I dont really know how. My parents basically told me that I evolved backwords, I was a very happy kid that could do quite a lot when I was a child, but now as an adult I hesitate, I close down, I feel like a shell of my former self. I dont know what caused me to change to a completely different person, and Id like to at least be a little more confident in my abilities.",

    "Depression after graduating university I graduated from university a few months ago and am in limbo back home with my parents. I am supposed to be applying for jobs but I feel completely paralysed with fear. I have always suffered from incredibly low selfesteem. My parents are really critical of me so I have started avoiding seeing them and just spending my time in my room alone. Friends are all busy with work and university. I feel incredibly low. I have not left the house in 11 days now and can barely muster up the energy to brush my teeth and shower each day. My days have no structure and I just eat junk food as I feel too lethargic to prepare proper meals for myself. Each day I wake up late 11amish and then count down the hours until 7pm when I can start getting ready for bed again. Getting into bed is perhaps the highlight of my day as it means another day of my life is over with. My mum just came in my room and told me I need to sort myself out. She finds it all pathetic and is angry at me. I get it. But that is not what I need. Can she not see that I am not well at the moment? I also have been suffering with anxiety. Everyday there is something new to worry about. Yesterday I thought I had breast cancer, a couple of weeks ago it was cervical cancer, etc. Even applying body lotion to my arms I am scared I am going to see a dodgy mole. I just feel so hopeless. But I get these brief moments of sadness when I think to what I was like this time last year. I was in university, surrounded by friends, top of my year, genuinely springing out of bed to go to university. I dont know how it went bad so quickly. I know I can turn it around. Sunday night I prepared a simple todo list to just look for jobs and identify three I wished to apply to. A simple task which breaks down the scary process of job hunting down to tiny steps but it is Wednesday and I still have not done that.",
    "Deleting everything Ive thought about it a lot these past few months. I want to completely wipe all of my electronics and just get rid of them. Theres nothing bad on them or anything, I just dont want to deal with it anymore. The only thing stopping me from doing so is my online friend. Weve been friends for about 3 years and hes the most supportive person Ive ever had in my life. If I get rid of everything, I wont be able to talk to him anymore. Part of me doesnt want to stay in touch with him though. It may sound weird but I feel like if I lose touch with someone important in my life such as him, Id have an excuse to cut ties with everyone else. I know it doesnt make much sense. Its not only that though. I want to get rid of a majority of the things I own and I want to stop talking to people altogether. I wish I could just run away but I dont know what Im trying to run away from. I wish I could start life over again, but we all know that cant happen. My original plan was just to move far away when I turn 18, leave everything behind, and never look back. I dont know what I want to do or even what I should do.",

    "Had my 1st doctor appointment to address my anxiety/depression, it was......weird. Need some feedback, please. Are antidepressants and medications like this still a total crapshoot? Cant doctors to prior testing to figure out how a particular medication will affect an individual? It just feels odd...coming from a world Id previous known getting diagnosed and treated for migranes where everything was testing testing testing! MRI and Cat Scans and Blood tests and this and that!!! before being able to figure out something that works for migraines. But now with my mental health its just idk, well throw this against the wall and see if it sticks. Makes me incredibly uncomfortable. ampx200B 3. When taking my first steps to address my issues a few weeks ago and making this appointment with a psychiatrist, I had absolutely no idea what kind of doctor Im supposed to see, what is recommended, or who even diagnoses you with depression or anxiety. I dont want to selfdiagnose, it just doesnt feel right. After this appointment I still didnt feel like I was formally diagnosed, just given medication. So I chose this Psychiatrists office because they had decent reviews of any I could find. I made an appointment before I understood that the Psychiatrist is the one that mainly focuses on drugs and medication, NOT therapy. Does formal diagnosis happen? What kind of doctor does that? Or is that a totally false preconceived notion I have. What kind of doctor is it most common to see first? A psychologist, CBT, psychiatrist, therapist? I just dont know all the terminology. ampx200B The path Ive currently chosen Ive not taken my medication not started, cancelled appointments with this psychiatrist, and gotten an appointment for CBT with a therapist first, which feels like a safer path for me. As much as I want to address my issues NOW Im impatient, going straight to medication just didnt feel right... ampx200B I could go on a rant about just how difficult it has been for someone with no prior experience trying to deal with this new situation in American Healthcare, but I wont.",
    "How do others find energy to continue. I just feel so hopeless and numb been contemplating suicide more or less daily the last 5 years atleast. Pushing 30 hate my job, really hard finding a new one and once I do my employer sabotages my references and since there is an abundance of applicants like 200 for every job in my area they simply choose another one. Skilled craftsman in a field no longer required started my own company in highschool which went great for a few years until it didnt. Took my current shitty job to pay the bills, tried going back to college and working at the same time to avoid student loan but during my second year the depression really hit me and I dropped out and the last two years have been a constant struggle to come back mentally. I dont really enjoy anything anymore the only thing that keeps my mind occupied on more positive thoughts is spending a couple hours every day at the gym but even that is starting to diminish in effect. Pretty much isolated myself socially since I just feel worse trying to hang out with my friends. How do others find the energy to continue trying to improve their life with constant failure and rejections? I feel like Im stuck on the same page as if I were still 20.",
    "Why do I feel so shitty Yeah I post here like everyday, I cant get myself to do any of the things I say Ill do. I feel like Ive done everything I could do at this point, so why do I feel so shitty? I feel so tired and emptyheaded even though I really need to start on a paper for school. I just cant make myself get up to do it, I feel like I cant even start bc I am so weighed down by my own thoughts. I feel ugly, useless and I wish I could just get over that, learn to accept it in the back of my mind as something I cant change so I could actually do shit. I dont know what else I can do. Going to try to email my dr tomorrow, but I guess I wont if I dont get a good start on this paper bc Im spending so much money on college, literally cant afford to not do my best or get a shitty grade.

Im sorry i am not sure how this works exactly but if you have any other suggestions you can add them. i would need someone extremely open minded though because i have been through a lot of unexpected stuff. of course i will try to help too. please reach out if you are interested in us helping each other. just keep in mind that i am looking for a friend not a partner so your sexuality should not matter thought i know straight men or lesbians feel more comfortable talking to girls in general and that is okay. i dont care about your race or gender or anything but i am kind of beat down of talking to so many strangers on reddit without actually building a meaningful connection with anyone so please leave sort of intro in the comments. thank you for taking the time to read this, even though i might be a bit awkward.",
    "This is a cry for help... My story is a little bit long so I apologize for that. Im a step away from suicide. Ive been dealing with depression for at least 19 months now, and everything sucks. Hi there. Im a 19 year old boy from Iran. First let me make it clear that Im an atheist and this is story isnt from a religious perspective. But Iran has a religious culture and government which has affected this story. I grew up lonely. My mother and father were never there for me. They just had a lot of expectations from me cause I was a smartass kid. But they never really cared about the pressure they put me through or my feelings. I started dating when I was 18. Yeah, a year ago. How did I start dating? It was my last year in high school and I was studying the shit out of myself to get accepted in a great university. Just 5 months before the big test, I was so sick from the pressure. I needed someone. I needed someone to love, someone to love me. my family sucks. So I started dating this girl who was the same age I was. One thing I need to explain to you guys is that relationships in Iran are really different from Europe or USA. They proceed a lot faster. I know its wrong. But its part of the modernreligious culture that you live in. For example you have to say I love you in the first month. Crazy, isnt it? Also most relationships in iran dont include sex. Cause most people in iran believe that hymen test is scientific. And doctors are making money of this myth. Fuck. So I started dating her and we dated for 2 months. I became extremely obsessed with her. I loved her so much. Please dont judge me for that. It was my first serious relationship and I completely fell in love. She told me the same. But after 2 months she told me that she cant get her ex out of her mind and broke up with me. Making me realize I was just a rebound. I spent the next 8 months completely depressed.",

    "Pretty sure I’m the least favorite child My mom f, 45 treats me FtM trans, 20 like shit, yet my younger brother m, 4 is allowed to hit her, swear at her, scream his demands at her, etc without getting more than a quiet dont do that. Hes become the brattiest and most rude child Ive ever seen. He used to be a very nice and polite kid, but now he knows he can get away with being a total asshole, so he constantly acts like a total asshole. He says stuff like give me the TV remote or Ill kill you and cut your eyes out, like horror movie scenarios. I get screamed at if I try to discipline him and tell him he doesnt need to be saying that sort of thing. If I was to do the same thing, I would be screamed at, told to get a job Im mentally and physically disabled, currently going through occupational therapy to help find me a suitable job, but this isnt enough to keep her happy, have things taken away, etc. Another brother of mine m, 14 completely agrees that my moms parenting is ineffective. My mom is nicer to him than she is to me, but shes still unnecessarily rude to him as well. Weve both tried bringing it up to her, but she just gets defensive and resorts to personal attacks against us both. For example, for me she would say something like well you dont work and youre taking all my money and for my brother she would say stuff like well youre just on your computer all day. She also defends her crappy parenting by saying you wouldnt understand, youre not a parent I may not be a parent and I dont plan on ever being one, but at least I know that no one, much less 4 year old children, shouldnt be punching people to get what they want and using threatening demands. I dont know how much longer I can keep taking all these attacks while my little brother is allowed to be a dick. Its taken a huge toll on me and I constantly feel like Im never doing good enough in life. I know Im the family disappointment by being trans, autistic, and fat, but god fucking dammit Im trying my best. But my best is never and has never been enough.",
    "I hate how bad I am at art, but I don't know what to do about it. Hi, so Im an amateur artist like REALLY amateur, my art skills suck and despite trying for over a decade I cant seem to improve. Art has always been a passion of mine, as well as something I genuinely enjoy doing on the extremely rare occasion that I manage to produce a slightlylesssthanusual drawing at least so feeling like my art is stuck at the subdeviantart level has made me incredibly frustrated and is probably the leading contributor to my depression. Its getting to the point that Im beginning to wonder if I should force myself to avoid art in general just to keep the selfhatred at bay. The problem is that I dont know WTF Im supposed to do about it. I tried to ignore it for a couple years, tried to tell myself art was just a phase and I wasnt into it anymore, but that didnt work. Ive tried multiple methods of improvement Ive taken both private instruction and community college classes, but I seem to have terrible luck as theyve all been pretty crap. I feel like Ive exhausted all of my options. I havent tried online classes, but judging by the reviews Ive read for places like Udemy and Skillshare I doubt theyd be any better. Ive tried looking for tips online, but all I get is basically the artist equivalent of git gud. It seems like the only option I have left is just practice nonstop for the 20 years and hope I magically improve Saitamastyle. Unfortunately, I just dont think I can do that. Ive had so many setbacks and failures in my life that I genuinely dont think I have the patience to wait until Im in my mid40s before Im halfway decent at drawing. Even worse, the fact that Im colorblind and extremely nearsighted as well as lacking whatever Matrixvision lets you visualize an object as brush strokes and color values makes me wonder if practice would even do me any good at all. Anyways, Ive rambled too much. TLDR  I suck at art, I dont know how to not suck at art, and this makes me really fing depressed.",

    "I got cheated on by my now ex-boyfriend of six years and I feel worthless I didnt know because he never opened up to me even when I asked. He then proceeded to ask if I wanted to join him on trip which just took place this Monday through Wednesday. In that moment I got angry. How could you tell me to go on this trip when you just told me you didnt love me? It wasnt logical. We argued and towards the end he said he was done. I asked him to clarify and he needed some space from me. Fine. I let him be until he contact me on Sunday the 10th wanting to meet up the following day. We didnt end up meeting up on Monday and did a follow up instead on Tuesday. We talked. I was worried for him. I told him that people were concerned for his safety and he just laughed it off with the laugh of a maniac. He said that why did people care. He was so distant. Before I left I asked again where we stood. And he told me to give some time. I asked for how long and he told me he would let me know. Fast forward to this Monday. He told me to have any false hope of getting together. We went on our trip and I noticed he was texting a lot while trying to angle himself to hide his phone. It was something I noticed right away. We moved on through the day. We got to our destination. While laying down on my bed he came laid down next to me. It was odd because he didnt want to be close to me previously. We went about our day. Came back to our Airbnb and as I was laying down again he came into my room again and fell asleep next to me. After our naps we went out to explore the town. Had a couple drinks went back to our Airbnb and ended up sleeping together. The day of the concert having woken up from a hangover we just stayed in had some breakfast and watched the hearing. We eventually got ready for the event we were in town for. We ended up getting to the venue early enough where the line was already forming.",
    "How can I even tell if antidepressants are working if I have no way to tell? So I was diagnosed with depressionampanxiety when I was 12 and my family wasnt very supportive, they basically chalked it up to teenage angst and did nothing to help me. So now Im 19 and at college and in an environment with friends and a loving boyfriend that actually gives a fuck about whether I live or die. Ive been going to therapy services that my school offers and its helped I think and theyve also got me on my first ever round of antidepressants, Zoloft. Ive been on it for about 2 months and I really thought they were helping, like I could go out in public alone and not freak out. But now I just feel lost and like everything is somehow worse than it ever was before and Ive been bottling it up and repressing it because thats all I know and also I suck at emotion identification because of said repression. I think I was trying to convince myself I was better because all I wanted to do was feel what it would be like to be normal and not have to live with this feeling of dread and hopelessness and wanting of nothing. Mainly I just want to know what itll be like to actually be on something that has a positive impact or something that actually helps instead of me convincing myself it does but actually doesnt. TLDR depressed and thought meds were helping but actually werent. How can I tell that theyre actually helping instead of making it worse?",
    "Therapy anxiety I dont know if this us the right place to ask this but here goes nothing. I had therapy a few years ago, combined with medication, which ended up worsening my mental health and adding extreme anxiety with therapistsfear of even talking to them to the list because of previous shitty experiences with them was wrongly diagnosed and treated. After two years of my condition getting worse and worse to the point of daily meltdowns, mood swings, and other problems wont go into details because even writing this as anon on here makes me uncomfortable and anxious I decided that enough is enough and I need to do something. We me and my mother were recommended a therapist, since I didnt want to go to someone with no recommendations and reviews. I wanted to contact the therapist. Really wanted. But didnt, because every time I thought of it I was on the verge of tears and freak out for who knows what reason. Since its been more than two months already, my mum gently asked if she could help shes very understanding and trying her best to support me for the past few years. So, I asked her to contact the therapist asking about consulting daughter, age 20 me. To which the therapist answered that shes an adult and can contact me directly if she needs therapy. My mums reply about me having issues with communication and asking her to write were ghosted by therapist. So, my question is. Did I fuck up? Im overanalyzing everything, I know, but was asking my mum to make the first move to contact the therapist the wrong thing to do? I dont know how to deal with this situation. Maybe someone had similar experiences?",

    "My partner is tired of my depression. What now? For the past year, Im arguably at my all time low. Lost my job a year ago and couldnt get myself back together since. When covid rolled around, fuck me. My partner for the last 4 years were long distance as shes abroad for school witnessed me slipping down and down the slope throughout the year. With patience and understanding, she was always there. Now, shes getting tired of it and she admitted it. Not sure if she still loves me the same, but one thing is for sure, shes tired of putting up with the episodes. im not so sure if i can put up with this the rest of my life. but she still remains, still providing what support she can spare. Were still okay, at least for now. I see the merit of hearing the call to leave me. I also know that shes gotta do whats best for her. But now what? What do i do? What can i do? How do i get better asap so i can be better for her and everyone around me? Depression is kicking my ass. Hope we all find a way out of this one day.",
    "Years of worsening chronic fatigue/fog continue to cripple my life Caffeine in any form doesnt help either. Ive seen 3 different psychologists, all of whom were baffled and said they did not know how to help me and have never heard of this before relative to mental health issues. I feel this intense dissociation feeling 247 that has gradually emergedworsened over the past couple of years. Like Im so tired, I dont even feel like Im in real life ever anymore. I feel drunkdrugged, especially as the day progresses. Come 8 PM, I feel so spaced out, the fatigue is unbearable. Sometimes, I feel so tired I feel physically ill. The gradual cognitive decline is shocking Concentration, alertness, memory, focus, processingrecallingstumbling over words and sentences, confusion, etc.. My motor skills have also declined badly as well. I bump into things, my reflexes are awful, I miss things when I try and grab them, etc. I feel dizzylightheaded when I stand up after sitting or laying down. I now have very low arousal. Its almost impossible to startle me. Its like my body doesnt even process loud noises or scare anymore. I feel anxiousstressedoverwhelmed more easily. Everything feels like a chore, like an ordeal I get to check off. Even if it is something extremely minor or something fun. Decision making is poor, even for relatively minor things. Hypersomnia Usually fall asleep very easily, rarely have insomnia. Vision has declined eye floaters, spots, light sensitivity. Eyes are drywatery off and on. Numbness all over body. Tough to explain, but extremitiesbody parts feel so utterly exhausted and numblike to the touch. Like I can feel my arm getting touched by my hand, but cant feel my hand touching my arm.

My husband was layed off over a month ago and still havent received one penny of unemployment. During this chaos, we also found a small infestation of bed bugs so we had to pay a fortune to get rid of them or else be evicted. I dont know what to do anymore and Im feeling hopeless.

When I ask they swear Im not, but part of me feels as if theyre saying that to be nice and not to hurt me. They let me ranttalk to them about things I deal with and how I feel, but I feel as if Im making them feel bad also and becoming more of a burden than a friend. I feel as if Ive ruined what couldve ruined any future with 2 different people because of it. I believe I understand and know the source of my depression and anxiety, and partly has to do with my familys religious beliefs. Yes Im a Christian, but my beliefs are different froms theirs and if they knew, it would be a huge mess and them possibly kicking me out. My parents currently help pay for my college, but Im hoping in the next year or so I can get a parttime job or internship to make enough to move out. Anyways, the only access to help I have is counseling at school. I want to be better and be happy and normall, but I dont know how and my parents beliefs mostly their church restrict me from doing so. I feel as if Im stuck and in a constant loop of finally being happy, something happening or realize what Im wanting to so is against what they believe, my anxiety getting bad, and then depressed. I have a close friend that tries to help me, but I feel as if he doesnt think Im trying to get better. He understands the situation Im in, but I still cant help but think that. I also got diagnosed with endometriosis which then restricts a lot of physical things I can do, which makes things worse mentally for me. Ive been asked by another friend if I have a hobby or something to keep me distracted, but I dont. I never did much activity growing up due to religious beliefs like sports or anything else. Even when I did find something I liked to do, I was told I couldnt anymore and had to give it up. I just feel as if Im stuck and I just dont know what to do anymore.",

    "Why can't i ask for help? Hi. Im a twenty year old man currently failing university. Well, Im pretty sure Im failing. Ive given late handins for a lot of my projects, not done other projects properly, and not handed in some other projects all together. Whenever I get stressed I dont do anything and I still havent made any friends at uni. To be fair, I do have high school friends, but none of them are interested in the field I want to go into. I feel so alone a lot of the times, I feel useless and I feel dumb. I did go for therapy in the past, it was just for a couple of months after I told my mom I was cutting myself. That ended when my therapist said I didnt need any help. Im sorry, Im babbling. The point of why Im writing this is because I cant seem to ask the people in my life for help. Hell, right now Im swinging back and forth between asking a bunch of internet strangers. But I feel like Im going crazy. Every time I make up my mind to go tell my mom or my sister or my brother about these things, I convince myself out of it. i tell myself that these problems arent that big of a deal, that Id only be disturbing them my sister recently had a baby, so shes spending a lot of her time taking care of him that these problems arent problems and that I just need to get off my stupid lazy ass and do my work. And then i dont ask for help. And now Im starting to think that this post is a dumb idea. This wont actually achieve anything. Im complaining to strangers about problems that arent problems. Im just being stupid. Im sorry.",

Ive noticed myself being unable to clean my room or find energy to go work out, and I either sleep too long and feel guilty or spend all night awake exhausted but unable to sleep. Im so tired. I cant do anything, I cant even hang around my friends because it feels like they hate me or Im not good enough. I either try to starve myself to feel the pain of hunger or overeat to get rid of the pain. I have no one to talk to.

    "Suicidal Thoughts I think about killing myself every week. Every time I do, I feel like Im inching more and more toward the day Id actually do it, like Im on a train speeding toward a cliff and theres nothing I can do to stop it. I compose the letters Id leave behind bit by bit in my head. Brother, youre the firstborn son our parents shouldve had, and youll do a much better job at it than I have. I love you and Im truly sorry for everything. Sister, I love you too and Im sorry for everything. Dad, I know you only wanted to do good. I know you wanted the best for us. I know you tried. Im sorry I couldnt be the son you wanted to have. And Im sorry for destroying your marriage. Pray for me. As to my mother, I couldnt even begin to think of the words Id leave behind for her. She deserves more. She deserves more than she ever had. I know I shouldnt be feeling this way and thinking like this but Im a burden, a bug in the matrix and they will all be better off without me. I came to a happy family and I ruined everything. I feel irrevocably, irreconcilably lost. I dont fit anywhere, I dont belong with anyone and wherever I take refuge Im eventually discovered to be the anomaly I am.

Im going through a backslide right now and I almost want to ask those around me for help on things like checking in to make sure I got out of bed today or have eaten something since I have a tendency to starve myself. I feel like I should be open about what Im dealing with, but I also know that if I do, Ill feel weak, like Im putting my illness on their shoulders, and that theyll suffer because of me. I was suicidal not long ago and I feel myself returning to some of the thoughts that accompanied those feelings. I feel terrible for what I must have put them through, thinking I was going to die and the last thing I want to do is put them back in that position. I feel guilty asking them to help me because I dont know if they can break me out of negative cycles. Only I can get myself in a healthy mindset.

I live in a 3rd world country, so therapy here aint an option if youre not insanely rich, which Im not. My parents split up in very bad terms, but still live together since none of them have any other place to go than this, so you can imagine how it is. Both of them bitch about each other secretly behind each others back a.k.a. with me. Since my older brother leaves for work early and comes home late, my parents have literally no one else to talk to but me. I understand that totally and try to listen to them as best as I can. But they bitch about how the other one suck, what they do bad, how inconsiderate and ridiculous they are, etc. My dad does this more often. Also, I feel like my dad has become incredibly lazy. Hes 60, retired but is in perfect physical shape, in general. I know there are things that he shouldnt do anymore, but he literally wont eat anything during the day if no one else is there to cook. ANYTHING. He wont tidy up, he wont even move from his char if he doesnt have to. Im a college student. I got a ton of papers and things to study lately, since its my second year and I dont always have the time to do things. My mom works until noon and comes back to continue to work. Shes a teacher.

Sometimes it can get to the point where Ill have difficulty remembering things or having a conversation, I dont know how to formulate sentences, and it just becomes allconsuming. I dont understand it. My thoughts in this state range from craving substances to escape, thoughts about how nobody likes me and I dont matter to anyone, and sometimes thoughts that I need to hang myself. I want to have a good life but I dont want to live it as me. Im way too hard on myself. I know I have a charismatic personality that some people enjoy, and I can acknowledge some of my strengths when Im more level headed, but more and more I just regress to what I described earlier where my mind just tries to take me down.",

    "am I suicidal even if I know I won't kill myself? Sorry I dont usually post so this might be kind of sloppy. for starters, I am not going to kill myself. I care too much about other peoples feelings. And my cats. But all my mind can think of is how nice it would be to be dead. Ive been depressed like this one other time in my life, but this is the first time I have seriously considered self harmI guess as a way to escape the internal pain? I havent taken any steps to self harm but I have a strong urge to do so. I just want everything to end. I have no drive to do anything. Im irritable as fuck. Nothing is going right and even if it was I probably wouldnt acknowledge it. Idk how to get out of this mindsetI have absolutely no urge to change anything, which is what everyone keeps telling me to do. Ive tried to look for psychiatrists and psychologists but its super fucking hard in this mental state and theres a shit ton of steps to just get on the waiting list, and finding someone who takes my insurance etc.... My question is whether or not this is still considered suicidal, even though I know I wont end my life, I would just like to. Anyone else experience this?",
    "Advice on intrusive thoughts? Hi! Im 19F and have been going through a depressive episode since late Decemberearly January. Its the first time Ive had this, or at least to this extent. Im on 50mg sertraline, but have begun to decline again more recently, so am making a doctors appointment about the possibility of increasing my dose. My parents are both mental health professionals so Im pretty lucky there, able to get advice on how to verbalise feelings, and what they think I would benefit from. Anyway, the reason Im writing is because Im suffering pretty badly with what I can only describe as intrusive thoughts. For me, theyre all memories of times Ive hurt someone or done something negative. A lot of them are extremely minor or where nobody was hurt, but I do so much mental gymnastics to the point that they seem life destroying. They almost feel like flashbacks, and I get more intense panic than I had while the events were actually happening. Theyll come if Im doing uni work, watching TV, in the shower, just woken up.. it doesnt matter. So my questions are has anyone experienced this sort of thing? If so, how do you deal with it? Ive been recommended EMDR and given details of a good therapist who could do this. Is this recommendation echoed by anyone with personal experience? Thanks ahead of time, and let me know if any more info is required! !",
    "I’m having a really hard time Im really struggling maintaining my will to live. Im tired of everything. And dont want do go through everything to come. I recently went through some therapy through my college. My assigned therapist was a practicum student and last week was our last session together after this entire semester. I feel very empty now. My mom lost her brother to suicide and my best friend lost another one of her good friends the same way. Seeing first hand the way it affected them keeps me going but that feeling is diminishing. Im just so tired of everything and I have no motivation or energy to do the simplest of tasks. When I think of my future it seems like such a long road ahead of me and I dont want to do it. Im really struggling. I can sometimes see a future for myself and my career but at the same time that dream seems so fantasized and that Ill never make it",

I have healthy lifestyle exercise often, sleep well but It doesnt change anything. I lost my emotions, no interest in everything.i have every possible symptoms of depression.

    "Being a teenager sucks Hi, To preface this Im going to sum up myself. Im a lonely geek teenager thats an only child with no pets, like stereotype computer geek. I just got back into physical classes again after 2 years doing online ones which I preferred I just moved and am having a tough time making friends and a tough time with my parents Were in a small apartment while ours gets renovated so Im sleeping on the couch and then going to school with no privacy really. My parents always try to turn the tables on me and then make things my fault or make me do things then insult me for things Im forced to do. I got some clothes a while ago I said I didnt like and I said I didnt like the fit , so I didnt wear them, now its my fault that I asked for them or other times they just say that I have to wear stuff because they say so. It feels like every night theres a screaming match between me and my dad or my parents , my mother is always seemingly depressed or has an attitude , I dont have friends and dont know how to make any. I just really dont know what to do. Teenagers nowadays dont care about Linux or old music , all they wanna listen to is shitty rap and use fucking tiktok. When we went to my doctor I had to take an exam where I have high signs of depression and my parents were told I should see a psychologist , that never happened of course They have alcohol with breakfast, lunch, and dinner which doesnt help either and it always feels like the standards are against me and that everything I do gets judged. They treat me like they own me and like I cant speak. Because no matter what I think my mom is always more important all she does it cook and smash I swear to god I really dont know what to do. Ive tried offing myself in the past and my mom laughed at me and screamed dont be ridiculous. I tried to come out as LGBT to them and was made fun of and still am and I have to lie that Im not. It makes me so angry seeing other people in classes and knowing they have pets and siblings and loving parents , and I dont. We just want the best for you Telling me to off myself and that everything I do isnt goof enough doesnt fucking solve that.",
    "I need help communicating with my depressed wife. I love my wife. I really do. It breaks my heart that our ability to communicate has broken down entirely. Everything I say runs through a negativity filter and gets interpreted as personal attack. Seriously. Ive been told Im too logical. Which might have some situtational truth to it. Not all conversations call for logic, and I probably do apply these processes to more wishywashy, emotional conversations than I should. But Im working on not always trying to be Mr. Fixit. That I overthink and analyze things that dont need to be analyzed. Which I think I know what shes getting at, but Im unaware of any problem that was solved by not analyzing possible solutions. I know not every complaint is a request for a fix. But when its a constant refrain of complaint for weeks or months, maybe its time I tried to help alleviate? And that I talk too much and dont listen. So I make active efforts to listen and say nothing. Even when painful and untrue accusations are flung at me. Like supposed infidelity or that I dont love her anymore because her depression has caused her to gain a few pounds by over indulging on icecream. Even when I feel like I should tell her those ideas and accusations are not only unhelpful, but deeply untrue, and hurtful to me, I just take them on the chin, because when I have attempted to reassure her of their falseness, in the past, that I still love her, thats taken as needless contradiction and proof that I dont listen. In response to these accusations, Ill respond something like, Okay, Ill just listen then. How does that make you feel? And I get the angry response of, See!? Just like that! Youve always got an answer for everything! I have to be missing some piece. How can I promise to only listen, and ask a question, and by the time it gets to her ears, it has mutated into an antagonistic criticism or correction. I feel like Im totally locked into a Twilight Zone episode. How do I communicate with someone that will reject the behavior they just asked for?",
    "I got into rpg commu to escape reality but It made my depression got worse. Im 22 years old who currently struggling with film thesis in my senior year. My thesiss topic is hard and its stressing me out. And I found this community where you draw a character and roleplaying with others character in some sort of setting like MMORPG. So I decided to use it to escape from some stress from my works. But it turned worsen. I have no friends there and its like everyone is knowing each other. I know the fact that I didnt active much because of my works and Im kind of confident in my drawing and painting skill Im parttime freelance artist. But nobody played with me or make their character talk to mine. I got anxious so I tried to please everyone by praising their characters in introduction posts or asking for our interactions of our own chars. Some didnt reply my message. In the last 5 days, I got sleepy entire day, lost an appetite, I only ate a small meal or snack once in a day and insomnia. I felt left out. So I brought my account to follow their public account with feeling that If I befriend with them maybe theyll be interact with me ? Some of them turned out fine. But theres one who seemed to hate me because stupid me had bad choice of words when complimented their char. At first, they didnt know Im the owner of that char, they seemed happy enough but once they knew the truth, they seemed off and didnt talk to me since. I know its stupid to give a damn about mimicking world where those members came from wherever in the world. But its so stressing when you feel like talking to a brick and everyone treats you like an air. Please say something, I really need support",

    "Scared to call crisis services Im in the USA. I have no insurance and effectively no money like, none I have some family, but asking them is out of the question. Im pretty sure somethings pretty wrong, considering Ive been crying and panicking and bludgeoning myself and thinking about suicide for years now, but I dont have any resources to go to an actual doctor. Earlier tonight when I was more worked up I called the US national suicide prevention hotline. The guy I talked to gave me the number for mobile crisis services in my rural county. I explained my financialinsurance situation to him and he assured me that if I call them, a doctor with this service will come to my location and its free, no charge but even if its true, what then? I cant imagine theyre going to actually do anything except take me to a hospital, stick me there for a few days, maybe they give me some medication and then they release me and tell me to make a follow up appointment with a doctor somewhere I cant pay and probably cant physically get to no car, rural area, and I get a bill for the hospital stay. Which I categorically will not be able to pay. If thats what would happen, I truly am better off dead. TLDR I want help but I strongly suspect that if I ask for any, Im only going to get the opposite. Am I crazy or am I right?",

I dont want to sound like the stereotypical 4chan incel but the never having a girlfriend part especially bothers me, like to the point where if I see a pretty girl in public or I see someone my age on social media being in a nice relationship or something I get like jealous and sad, and I dont want to be like that I should be happy for those people but Im just not. I feel like such a huge loser who is going to be stuck just loathing myself forever.

    "My life is amazing, but I'm a miserable asshole. I'm not sure what to do. I have been in quite a few abusive relationships romantic and platonic so I know theres some trauma Im still working through. But the problem is that despite all the progress Ive made and all the wonderful things in my life, I cant feel any of that wonderfulness. I see my wife, I know I love her, I can act on that love, but I cant... feel it. Its just numb. I watch a show that makes me happy, and I just cant... feel that happiness. Its like Im constantly, permanently disconnected from anything positive, and no matter how healthy my habits might become or what attitudes I choose to adopt, neutral is the best I feel about anything. On top of that, its like Ive forgotten how to have fun. I have hobbies that I never pursue. Ill buy something, say a video game, and never play it. I have a pile of books Ive bought but never read, and sadly, its not because Im just too slow at getting through them. Its like, when I try to do something that isnt work, I get these voices not literal in my head screaming you shouldnt be doing this. The more I try to have fun, the worse I feel about it. I mentioned I just graduated college  three years at a community college couldve been 1 12, thanks shitty counselling department! and 2 years at UCSD. I graduated  though there wasnt a ceremony or anything thanks Covid  and felt... nothing. I didnt feel pride, or relief, or anything. It was like Id just finished washing the dishes  okay, thats done, whats next? A couple of years back, I got my black belt in a very difficult martial art after 7 years of training three times a week.

    "Why can't depression ever be gone forever? Hi, sorry i still dunno how reddit work yet. I just joined and its my first time talking about such stuff online. Ive been diagnosed with depression and few other stuff few years ago and i had treatement and such until i felt better but whenever i got into an argument with family i could feel it crawl back in me. Up until now Ive been strong enough to overcome those small situations. And even tho i feel better most of the time i can feel it whenever im sort of reverting back to it. Like i start to go out less and less, i stop talking to people online and irl and answering the phone becomes a hard task.. then i start to distract myself by bingewatching shows so i dont leave space to thinking, i dontcant sleep at night and i have a hard time remembering things i just did or dont realize Ive done them. And i like reading but it becomes hard like i cant focus and i end up skipping lines or read without rememberingunderstanding what i just read. The more i stay home the harder it is to get out. Anyway thats how i know shit is getting serious. Other than that i sometimes have a hard time swallowing food the doctor said it was anxiety a lack of magnesium and having supplements did help but anyway. Two days ago came back home i was in a good mood i brought sweets for everyone at home except i fould out novody was there. I have a kitten at home i brought it recently about two months ago. its 5 months old and it still pees in the wrong spots when its far from its litter. The past few weeks it peed 3 times on my blanket and i had to take it get cleaned everytime. I barely got to use it so this time i had put it in a closed room so the cat cant get to it. But a cousin of mine opened the room to feed the cat there and my father had taken away the litter out of the room because thats what he does .. whatever he likes basically. Anyway when i came back i found the door open and pee on the blanket that i had just taken out of from cleaning a night before and put aside away from the cat but there it was dirty again.

    "I don't know what to do I just graduated from high school recently and I thought that would help with all my anxiety but Im just sitting in my room feeling lifeless. I dont sleep or eat regularly, and I barely know the time. The past 5 years have been really difficult for me, and Ive only had 2 people to talk to, one being a school counsellor. I think they just prolonged whatever I have but nothing really helps. I stopped having constant suicidal thoughts since 3 months ago, but it was so sudden and I just feel this lethargic tiredness always lurking. I dont know if its residual or its because everythings physically taking a toll on me. Even when everything I thought was giving me stress was over, nothing changed. And I have been trying to go out and meet my friends. Ive been out of my house more these days than most of my life combined. I thought whatever I was feeling might have been situational but I dont think it is. Ive tried swallowing pills a bunch of times and hurting myself and nothing happened, so I took that as a sign to try to be more healthy, but its not really working. I felt completely fine and then a few weeks ago I took 24 colored pills and thought maybe something would happen, and I just ended up with nausea and a stomach ache. Thats not normal, is it? I even took cough syrup with it. I dont get how nothing can happen, and I really dont get why Im still doing these things when Im not under stress which is usually the only reason I would hurt myself when it all started. I cant meet a paid professional because my parents wouldnt ever believe me. Theyre not bad people but theyre ignorant and misguided, and that mental illnesses only exist for people with real trauma. Theyd say I was lying or faking it. And believe me, Ive tried approaching the topic with them. I had 2 panic attacks in front of them and they still wouldnt let me meet a mental health counsellor even when we went to the hospital and the doctor recommended it. Whats wrong with me? Im just stuck. I dont even know why Im making this post.",

    "Severe anxiety and depression Most of my life I have suffered with depression, anxiety, self deprecating thoughts and worse case scenario imagery in my head almost nonstop. Its like a movie that never stops playing. I currently take 120 mg daily of CBD spread throughout to help manage my symptoms. Is there any hope for me to be alright without taking so much medication. To put it in imagery, It really feels like its a python constantly wrapped around my neck and When I take medication, I feel it let go for a while but can also still feel it just sitting there in the corner waiting for it it wear off so it can pounce right back on and keep strangling me. I need a long term solution. it has gotten so bad that I cant stop taking the CBD for more than a day without experiencing severe mental distress. Sometimes I cannot even function without it. When I took CBD for the first time it was also the first time I had ever felt normal. I am grateful to have this medication but at the same time I do not want to have to depend on this for the rest of my life. I just want the normal brain chemistry that other people seem to take for granted. Having a normal day for me is so rare its like finding buried treasure for me. And then I want to stay normal so bad and hold on to that good feeling that ironically, I bring the anxiety back about trying to stay feeling normal. It almost feels hopeless. Is there any hope that I can ever have a normally functioning mind without taking large amounts of medication? At this point my liver just has to take the hit because for my mind to feel the way it does without it I cant keep going like that.",
    "Should I kill myself? I am the most uninteresting person and I feel like I am the only one who puts effort into any of my relationships. I actually am in a relationship though, we started dating in april. Its a ldr though, and her timezone is 14 hours ahead. It was pure infatuation at the start, we both felt so confident about the relationship. She had plans to move to the same city as me, we had so much in common. We were both sort of shy and laid back. Though as I got more comfortable my extroverted side came out. I think I smoothered her too much though, I always complimented her and tried to tell her itll be okay and I am eilling to wait for borders to lift to meet her. She liked it so I kept doing it, but I think the repetitiveness, lack of physical touch, and my neediness eventually became unattractive. It became the norm. I was always there for her when she needed to talk, and we kept talking about how we are going to meet as soon as borders go up. It was hard to keep interesting and we didnt know what else to do. Then in the last month, things started getting hard for me at work and in my family, I opened up about insecurities about my mom health as she was diagnosed with cancer, and how I feel I have to work on my confidence. I think this must have really been a turn off. She has become more and more distant this past month. She still says shes into me but she doesnt talk about the future as much and is not nearly as affectionate as before. She has said she doesnt know how much longer she can do ldr, but shes willing to keep trying a little longer for me. But it feels like she isnt putting any effort and idk, the relationship doesnt feel secure and loving anymore. I talked to her about it and she said she really likes me, but she feels so distant. Idk what I can do to help this or if theres anything. I really like her, like we never fought, and we really matched. I loved gsming with her, or playing piano for her.",

I felt ashamed, scared I get in trouble and no one would believe me. ampx200B As years went on, I grew to be more of an oddball person, an outcast among my peers. I did not get along with the female gender, and I didnt care until I hit puberty. Around this time, Im still super awkward and bully by everyone. I didnt have many friends, maybe 23 and this stayed until high school. Up until this point, never had a girlfriend and didnt know how to approach any girl for it. My selfconfidence is long shot with abandonment issues. Most of my family thinks Im gay and Im still bullied. ampx200B Additionally, to all of this, I have developed depression. As a teenager, I look around and see people hooking up but not this guy. At home, I had several relatives just killing my confidence, saying I was gay saying I would never amount to anything and so on. I also have , and my family stopped getting medication for it. So now, even at school, Im struggling, staying in one spot in subjects Im not a huge fan? Yeah, it was not great, and I ended up skipping a lot. To this day, I cant ever get any medication for it either, but I save that little later.",
    "How to get brave enough to kill yourself PLEASE NOTE I am not in any danger to myself at this time so no need for urgency. TLDR self hate, worthlessness, getting over fear of death. Im just so tired of living. Ive always hated myself and people since a very early age and I cannot trust anyone. I feel absolutely wrong in this world. Everything I do or say or think is wrong. Since day one I was wrong. I cant do anything right like honestly not trying to exaggerate here and cant make any connections with anyone. Im actually unable to feel love or compassion or any sort of human connection. Dont even get me started on sex Im sick of watching everyone else get what I cant have. I dont deserve love or kindness and Im honestly sick of being the brunt of a very boring joke. I feel like the universe is constantly telling me I dont belong here I also feel like Im not THAT important to have the universe specifically pick on me. My role in this world is to be unremarkable and useless. I only see evil in the world, I can see no kindness. As long as there is man men, there can be on peace. Since the dawn of time weve chosen violence, death and hate. Even in the 21st century we still are starting wars, having genocides and famine and humans are becoming less and less human or more human?? I cant hold onto friendships or make any solid connections. I can only make friend with people who need someones shoulder to cry on and once theyre done with me, theyre gone. I also cling onto anyone that stays remotely too long and then feel utterly betrayed by the smallest problem they face me with. I freak out at the smallest things like dropping a spoon or having a giant mess. I used to be able to pretend to be happy and healthy and human but, as usual, I cant do that right so Im slipping. I cant stay at a job for longer than a year without freaking out. I work at a job Ive wanted for so long but see how little work or care is actually put in by my fellow coworkers and its maddening.",
    "My mom is depressed and I don't know how to help her Hi everyone, this is my first time posting here so let me know if this this isnt the right place. ampx200B My 20F mom 58F has been depressed, to some degree, for as long as I can remember. Were a pretty sad family all together honestly, but thats all Ive known from them. ampx200B For some backstory My dad 61M fixed up my grandparents old house the one my mom grew up in over the course of a few years. The old house was falling apart, and my dad wanted a new place to renovate before he got too old to do so. My mom never wanted to move in, but reluctantly agreed once my dad pointed out the benefits. ampx200B So here we are, a year after we move in, after all the garage sales and selling the old house, getting rid of sentimental items we couldnt keep and all the junk we didnt want. And shes spiraling, guys. Ive always been her person to vent to, since Ive been alive. And every night she tells me just how tired she is, of everything. How she misses the old house that they spent over 30 years in, how she hates every tiny thing my dad does, just blaming him for everything. She cried into my arms tonight asking what she has to look forward to everyday, to just tell her something good in her life to look forward to. And no matter what I said she would just cry harder. ampx200B I dont know what to do to help her, if anything. I know my dad isnt going to help because they argue just about every day and havent got along in like.. 15 years. My mom doesnt have many friends either, just her sister and some people she cleans houses for. Is there anything I can do to help her on the bad days?",
    "Almost suicidal again I used to be extremely depressed and suicidal, attempted once and failed, and that was sortoff my wake up call, I actually got the help I needed and my suicidal thoughts went away. Now Im almost there again, and theyre stronger now, I have people who can help me but It doesnt work anymore, Ive done exactly what I did last time and Nothing has even remotely helped. Is there anything I can do to stop these thoughts while I still can? Thanks",
    "I could use some help figuring out if there‘s a possibility I‘m suffering from depression This could turn out to be kinda long so I apologise in advance if anyone wants to read this. Long story short Im not sure if Im actually depressed or just imagining things. So, this took quite a lot for me to post this and I will try my best to describe my situation. Some general information Im 15M and have like a lot of germans been at home for homeschooling for almost a year know except for a few months where we went to school in person. To be honest I dont really know when things started but I was talking to a friend of mine videochat about a month ago and after he asked I explained to him how I was feeling. When I was done he said something along the lines of Hmm that kind of sounds like some depression you got there. Now to what I told him I think I stopped expressing how I feel at any given time at least a year ago and since covid took hold things have only gotten worse. I cant remember the last time I cried tbh i felt like crying pretty often lately or truly told anyone I wasnt doing too well. I always pretend Im happy and everything is normal so neither my parents nor my friends start worrying about me. One thing that really bothers me is that every time my friends who I 200 trust ask how Im doing I tell them fine. The conversation with my friend was an exception i guess. I want to explain it to them SO bad but somehow I keep stopping myself. A minor thing that might be worth mentioning is that I unfortunately remember practically every single mistake in my only relationship I ever had with a great girl I am not really over yet, friendships and in general ALL THE TIME. I always have to distract myself with something because every time Im left alone with my thoughts I go down the good old Why did I do that? Why would anyone do that? Whats wrong with me? Does heshe still remember that? road. School is almost insufferable because it leaves me a lot of time to think to myself and unfortunately its rarely happy thoughts. The thing that makes all this so hard to decipher for me is that Im never certain how I feel.",

    "Feeling at the end of the line A couple years later I met my first long relationship girlfriend and as you can imagine I fell hard for her and spoiled her like crazy, she helped my reconnect with my father and I told her about my trauma and to my surprise she also was a victim, we both tried to get professional help within our means but only I got serious about it and kept going to my sessions, she said she was fine on her own and knowing how hard this was I let her take her own choice and just tried to be supportive when needed, needless to say it ended bad, near the end when we were about to move in together I tried to start a conversation about how we began getting together and how special she was to me, apparently I was the only one that felt that way because she told me that the only reason she kissed me and begun hanging out with me was because she felt pity for me, we had other issues like a poor sexual life and not enough time on her part for us, so after she told me about how we really had begun our relationship I felt numbed and after a few days in emotional hell I broke up with her, I listed all that was wrong with the relationship and told her that something that begins with pity cant have a future, I wasnt able to tell her that that was what hurt me the must, she never apologized and we went our separate ways, her family loved me and knew I was the good guy and I was the best for her and tried to help but never went passed of a small conversation with me, they were harder on her but in the end they are her family, I found out she also cheated later on and it was what killed the last pieces of love I had for her, I didnt confront her about it and we never spoke ever again, the pity confession destroyed my self confidence we were together for close to 4 years. So after that and having gotten some more help with my trauma I went on the quest to become the best version of me and was doing ok, over a year later I meet my current wife, a person so beautiful that has made me feel what is real love and allowed me to love freely again, but another kind of problems fell onto us, financial problems.",
    "Does anyone struggle with figuring out whether you're depressed or just struggling?? And pulling yourself out of a deep depression? TW! Lifes not going good for me and Im realizing now that I may have been in a deep depression and not even realized it. Ive been depressed before and realized it but this seems different. Ive had good days and bad days but everyday it seems like I always drop to a deep low everyday. Idk if Im depressed or just over thinking it. I cant get myself to be happy. Ill find little moments of joy and some days Im in a really good mood but then always seem to drop down. Like Ill be having a good day and then it feels like the floor crumbled under me and now Im so low that I cant see light. I just dont feel good. Ive put up these many walls to keep emotions and feelings away because of my new job, home responsibilities and marriage responsibilities. Ive pent up so much that I cant even seem to cry. Ive tried but after like minute it just shuts off. Like I cant get myself to cry. Im at a lose and dont know what to do. I keep telling myself things will turn out OK but I just want to stop existing. Like I dont necessarily want to die but I also dont want to live. And this has been a consistent for months.

Nobody loves me or cares for me anymore, I was thrown out of my home by my mother who is fed up of me, my boyfriend who I love dumped me out of the blue, nobody seems to care that I have been feeling so awful for the past month. I feel like I cant talk to anyone. Things keep happening which is crushing any relief I have, Ive been humiliated by people this last week and want to be alone but at the same time I dont seem to be able to cope with being by myself.

Coz no one else understood me but him. Today my parents decided to stop talking or spending time with me. We have a duplex. I am supposed to stay in the upper flat.

    "Please help me She the new GP knows that I am diagnosed with two chronic painful diseases but she refused to give me any painkillers because just a paracetamol should be enough. I still need to wait a whole month to be able to visit my gyn, the only person that seems to care about my pain. So I am at home with no painkillers, in daily pain and so weak that folding the laundry makes me pant from the effort. I kept going to the same therapist but she is clearly not prepared to deal with chronic pain. I told her three times that i have daily suicidal thoughts and she just changes topic, she wont adress it. Also she gives me stupid advice that is incompatible with my diseases. In our last session she told me that I should consider working as a gardener again. How? Doing basic housechores is a nightmare for me, how I am suposed to do an incredibly physical job???? I am not going back... Then its the issue with my money. As I didnt had a job except the few months gardening in three years I barely have any money left I spent my savings doing a Master before coming ti Belgium. I cant sustain myself and I am compeltely dependent on my partner. I tried aplying for disability but as a migrant not only I dont have any right to get help but the social worker told me that if I dont find a job in two years when my status is reviewed I will likely be kicked out of Belgium. I will become a homeless person. To apply for any help in Spain I just need to work 12 months.... And then there is the issue with my partner. He loves me and tries to suport me. But he really doesnt want to hear about my pain or depression, I cant talk to him about anything that worries me. He simply doesnt care. He also refuses to do any house chores. He forces his SICK girlfriend to do all housechores walking the dog, cleaning, cooking, laundry, gardening, garbage.... He doesnt care that I am in pain or sick, he will simply not help me.",
    "I feel hopelessly inferior to everyone around me Its like there is the level of common understanding or thought that everyone else has but me. Its really hard to put into words because its just a feeling i get when i am outside, or seeing videos on the internet. Its like other people know what to say or how to act in situations im utterly lost in. And I also feel inferior because everyone else has so much experience and i havent had any. I feel like a sheltered baby compared to just my peers. They hook up, they smoketake drugs, go to bars and parties. I dont do any of that, still a fucking virgin. And when conversations inevitably get around to those topics, i feel terrible. I feel inferior, ashamed of myself, and lots guilt and self loathing. I think part of the guilt and self loathing comes from one of my initial reactions being hatred. I dont want to hate them, that doesnt make any sense because i want to be like them and theyre just living their best lives. But i do feel hatred because they not only get to casually do what i have cried myself to sleep wishing i could do. And then i turn that on myself. I shouldnt hate them, im a terrible person for thinking that. Thinking that makes you an incelneckbeardcreep. Its so grating to my ears to hear my neighbor having friends over or parties, or to hear people walking by outside on their way to a party or even just get some food. And i makes me want to slam my head. I know i can never get better if i think like this. But ill probably just never get better, period. Because i suck at socializing. I dont get invited to things. I dont have anyone to invite to get something going myself. I suck. Worthless, sack of shit. Better off dead",
    "All I want - is my death Good day, everyone. This is not my first post on reddit regarding my problem. Long story  short I had a girlfriend. We have been friends for 7 years. She was my best friend. We supported each other in everything and always helped each other. But, as often happens, I fell in love with her. And I ended up in the friend zone, of course. For the last 5 years I have been with her in the friend zone. Although at one point it became clear that I could get out of her if I was more persistent  she herself told me about it. But things went downhill this year. She found a boyfriend and spent all her free time with him. I, in turn, turned into a bunch of depression and occasional jealousy. And in the end, a month ago, she said that we both understand that this cannot continue. That we need to end our communication, and I will only feel better if she disappears from my life. Today I tried to write to her and make up, to offer her just friendship, communication on the network and nothing more, because I need her very much. But she refused me. And she did it with such contempt, with such hatred. She said that she did not need this communication, that over the past month she understood. that she hasnt needed it for a long time. So in the end, she doesnt even need me as a friend. I really thought that everything would work out, and we would be at least friends again. But I was wrong. She doesnt need me, in any form. Now it is difficult for me to think and do anything at all. I practically cannot go outside, because almost immediately I feel anxiety and, often, I start having panic attacks even if I just go out into the garden next to my house. Because I immediately start thinking that she is out there somewhere, with her new boyfriend. I cant read, watch movies, I cant play games, because my thoughts are occupied with something completely different. I need to write my dissertation, and I cannot concentrate, because my thoughts are not at all about studying.",
    "Dating someone with depression - help Hi, This is a throwaway account. I need some help andor advice. About a half a year ago I 32F started dating someone M42 absolutely amazing. We share interest, same humor, honesty have been there since the beginning, we can talk about anything, even shared deeply vulnerable stories and the sex is amazing as well. We seem to be able to connect in a way Ive never tried before and create this space where it is just us. Green flags all the way. I quickly fell madly in love with him ofcourse. I shared my feelings for him about 4 months into it, told him no pressure at all since I wasnt ready for a full blown serious relationship and he didnt either. I have no doubt that he has feelings for me. Non. About 2 months ago he fell deep down into depression. He told me. I told him if there was anything I could do to help? He said maybe. I told him I was there if he needed to talk. He said thank you. Asked him if he wanted to meet up again soon? He said he was feeling so bad and was overwhelmed at work he works a lot. I said no problem, you just write me when the time is better, no pressure and Im not mad. Take your time. He said he would. Its been a month since that last text, and I havent heard anything. My guts tell me to just wait, but I am worried and a little unsure of how to handle this situation.. Should I keep on waiting I am not in a hurry and if Im not going to continue my relationship with him I dont feel like dating at all right now or should I reach out? afraid of preassuring. Abandoning him is not an option. Please give me some advice or share if you have a similare story. I would love to hear from someone who has depression and who is dating someone who hasnt.",
    "Please give me some advice. I really need it. Hi! This is my first time talking about my problems online so I will write a lot. If you stay to read everything, thank you, I appreciate it, because I really need it. So, I am almost 17 and I have depression since back in secondary school. I am always isolated by my colleagues, who only use me when they need to. Even so, I am always there for them although not the other way around. In my country being selfish is in power, but my parents raised me to be kind and modest so its pretty hard for me to find any friend. Besides that, my parents treat me very badly, always yelling at me or punishing me out of nothing, sometimes pretending I dont even exist. They dont believe me even if I tell the truth and dont ever encourage me. Because of that i became shy and introverted. The only friend I had , who started talking to me two years ago, becaming my bestfriend and also my first love later, changed completely when she got into highschool, got a boyfriend and threw me aside even if I told her about my depression and she knew I really needed her. Now I am alone and I got used to it, but I need someone be there for me and my loneliness only makes me feel more depressed. I always avoid going out with my parents because I feel like shit with them but I hate myself for it and their disappointed looks break my heart. The only way to escape from reality is my phone, but I started using it too often, watching night after night anime even if I have severe myopia. I constantly feel tired, I have no motivation to do anything, I dont seem to be able to love someone anymore and I really cant see myself in the future. The reason I write this is because today I had a nightmare with that girl and when I woke up my chest was hurting so bad and I screwed up with my parents. If anyone has come so far, thanks again, and sorry about my bad English. I really need some advice  What should i do? How can I escape this?",

    "I am depressed.. nofap 200+ day plus Hello I have been on an incredible streak with nofap, which i thought would help with my depression. I lost my counter but it should be over 200 days now. I used to suffer everyday by watching porn and edgingclimaxing with a pillow or hand in order to fall asleep. It was a huge struggle for many years, but now, I find it easy not to do both those things. Potentially having someone to sleep with has helped me not relapse, however, I have not felt any benefits of Nofap and its frustrating. I was depressed before, Im depressed now. I had no motivation before, I have none now. The only reason I keep going is because of my will power.. and I feel at my breaking point. I am educated, with a stable job now and a wonderful girlfriend and friends who all love me. I count those blessings daily, but its so difficult because I am very negative. No positive thoughts run through my mind, just negative ones and negative memories. My SO and I have sex almost daily, but its hard for me to get hard. She excites me greatly, but its difficult for me to have sensation there or to will myself to get hard because I have thoughts like I am too small or I remind myself she has had sex before me and Im just so in my head, she wants me to be dominant but I really act submissive. I work out, I am extremely fit. I am very physically attractive according to many people, I have a lot of charm as people love to point out to me. Why dont i see any of it? why do i not like myself? i dont have a semblance of a identity and my brain is so foggy. I discussed with my therapist, and Meds are on the table but i dont think that will help me be more confident with myself... i cant meditate for long because my thoughts are just so painful.

    "Gf won't get help because she doesn't want to change Im at a complete loss here. I 27f suffer from depression and anxiety myself. Im having trouble reaching out for help, but Im slowly building the courage and doing self help because I want to get better and be a happy person. Last night my girlfriend 28f who has been struggling for a while told me that shes in a really dark place. When I started to lead the discussion into getting help or even just a little self help, she just gave me a flat out no. Shes been suffering for years and the various meds and therapy she goes through just help her for a little while and then she goes back to depression. She says she doesnt want to be different. She doesnt want to work on being happy because then she isnt herself. Doesnt like the feel of being on meds because she isnt herself. Shes fine just accepting being depressed as her default state and one day when shes tired of living shell end it all. She doesnt want to end it now so shes not eligible to be hospitalised. But she is calm and completely certain that eventually she will kill herself. I dont know what to do with such clear and calm certainty. She struggles with similar things that I do. I try to give the answers that hope are true. whats the point of living when all we do is work and sleep to pay for a place we never use because were working or sleeping Im not worth saving nobody cares etc, but she just refutes it and stays where she is. Problem is, I leave the country in the next 6 months so weve always known our relationship has an expiry date and she has no support network. She has no family and very few friends that are in a position to help out. Shes spent quite a lot of time homeless in the past. I dont know what to do. It feels like she only wants to get better if it happens organically, but that is a rarity. TLDR gf wont get help.",

Currently, Im working on my next video which will be about Depression and I could use the help of this Communitysubreddit. My background allows me to understand the science and psychology of depression but, luckily, I never have suffered from it myself though I experienced it secondhand when my mum got a major depressive episode a few years back. So I want to add to the video by infusing it with personal stories and experiences of real people who have suffered or are suffering from depression. I have 2 questions 1. What would be the single most important thing the public gets wrong about Depression. What do people who never had any experience with it dont get? 2. If anyone wants to share a story or personal experience with depression that I could incorporate in the next video anonymously without username if desired I would be honored.

    "Self-Improvement help After 2.5 years of living with my girlfriend she left. I dont want to get much into detail but up until some months ago relationship was great, then we started having some minor issues, which bummed me out a little. I never told her about it its no big deal, I cant justify being mad about this little thing... I thought. Of course you can figure that these minor issues only began to grew, pushed us apart and ultimately killed the relationship. When we recently talked about this it was already too late, but upon openly talking about the matter I understood her behaviour much better. Probably, if we had talked about that way sooner we could have saved the relationship. The problem is, it is not the first time I do that. I have had previous relationships die for the same reasons. So here I am once again, depressed because my fear of confrontation killed what was the best relationship, by far, that I have ever had. She was such a great girl and I fucked up everything. I also believe that it was not only lack of communication  confrontation fear. When things were going bad the thought of breaking up was constantly in my head. Again, I never told her about it nor decided to take the step myself. This is probably because I dont have many friends and fear solitude. There are a lot of times already when I feel lonely, especially during the latter months, and I didnt want to make matters worse. However, I am almost sure that having this constant break up thought made me unconsciously sabotage the relationship and be more distant. Of course, talking about this stuff earlier on would have probably helped. I am fed up with this, I know that keeping things to myself and other similar behaviours of mine are only going to keep destroying relationships, but its like I cant help it. As I said this is not the first time this happens to me and would probably not be the last one if I dont force myself to change.",

    "27, F, single, scared Hi all, Im a single 27 year old who is terrified about being single forever. I find it hard to connect with people or to find people to be attracted to. Ive only ever had feelings for 3 people since I was 17, Ive only ever had one relationship which lasted 6 months a few years ago. I have severe depression and other mental health issues, so my feelings are quite bleh in general and Im basically asexualhave no libido for the last 6 years over something that happened thats too complicated to explain here. I feel weirdly repulsed when a guy is into me because Im never into them. Im not trying to be shallow, I just dont find them attractive usually, which brings me guilt and self loathing. Im told a lot that Im beautiful I dont see it but I just cant seem to reciprocate those feelings. I do get a lot of male attention but I never seem to run into people that I want to be with. Am I destined to be alone? On top of this, Im a newly Christian woman who can only date fellow Christians now and I live in a small city with limited options. I feel awful every day as I worry that Gods will for me i to be alone. I have so many things going against me. On top of this, my depression sucked out any trace of maternal instinct I had and I dont even want babies anymore, which was a dream of mine. ampx200B I have nothing and Im worried that I always will have nothing. Is there any positive stories out there that are like mine? I feel so alone",
    "My (24) boyfriend (30) told me having a child is the only point of life and if he found out he was infertile, he would kill himself. He wants to see me pregnant and watch our child go to school and comfort them if they got bullied etc. He wants someone to take care of him when he gets old. Biologically, having a child is the only point of living and so having a child would cure his depression. I asked him what he would do if it turned out he was infertile and he point blank, no hesitation said he would kill himself. So that was extremely scary. I dont know what to do anymore. Ive tried to get him to go to therapy, but he sees absolutely nothing wrong with his worldview and i dont know how to convince him otherwise. Obviously, it is okay if we have to break up because our life paths are different, but honestly, hes done a lot of drugs weightliftingbodybuilding related and there is a very real possibility that hes infertile. I love him to pieces and will be crushed ifwhen we break up, but I dont know what i would do if he killed himself. Does anyone have any ideas for how to show him that the point of life is not only having a child? And yes, i did mention adoption which would provide the same tribe and care for him when hes old that hes so fixated on but he said he didnt want to adopt. Im just really worried and scared right now. Thank you all in advance. TLDR  my boyfriend thinks having a child is the only point to being alive and if he cant have a child he would just kill himself. I dont want a child but i also dont want him to kill himself. Help!",
    "Could you read me? So, since I was a child I was really close and sometimes, hyper protected to my momand the only other child company that I had was my brother, who is 3 years older than me. My brother is gay, and since always have been very feminine, and we used to play imitating pop singers and famous women. So I start to grew really feminine, but pay attention, IM NOT SAYING THAT THE FACT THAT I WAS FEMININE IS BAD. But when I went to school, the thing was not pretty. I spent the years of 4  11 being extremely rejected by my male colleagues and being accused of wanting to be a woman and being gay. Sometimes I was interested in playing soccer like the other boys, but I knew that I would be bullied Everytime I was feminine which was all the time. And these masculine activities would always have been a strange thing for me. My father was really interested in soccer, but never talk to me about it and my mother always rejected soccer just like every other thing my father liked. My brother... Not interested. But I would still play with him of imitate female singers and sometimes, put a fake dress into us. It was pretty much this dynamic until 2010, when I was 9. My brother and I were still playing this, until, in some moment, he started to touch my penis and put my hands on his penis. Im not gonna lie, I knew something wrong was happening, but I didnt actually think about it as sex. I didnt even knew what sex was, until the moment that he lay in the couch and put his penis, expecting me to blow it. Obviously, only now I realised that he wanted me to do oral sex on him, but at the time I didnt really know what he was wanting me to do. So I just stand there, paralized and nervously laughing. Later, he went to my front and put his butt in my penis and start dancing with it. I just felt so uncomfortable but couldnt get out, for some reason. I just remember crying hard at that night, just very disturbed. I just remember this fact very recently, with therapy. Since then it was just blocked from my mind.",

    "People say I'm a hateful person, how do I get rid of that characteristic? Especially family members. And I agree. I can talk for hours about people or things that I cant stand. The worst part about being like that, is that its devouring you from the inside. The hate gets real!! I start to think positively about people now, I tell myself how well they are doing and that they deserve it, instead of being jealous and hateful. I hope this works, and Ive been doing this for months now, sadly I relapsed because I was talking with someone who kind of has the same problems as I do, but instead of keeping our hateful conversation for himself, he snitched on me by telling my sibling your brother is such a good friend, we understand each other so well simply by how similar we talk crap about other people. I got got confronted for that and to be honest? I think its good that this person snitched on me, because I clearly deserve some ass whoopin. So..... Im at the bottom again, my whole process was for nothing... I think I have to accept that this is a part of me, being a disgusting hateful piece of shit thats talking crap behind peoples backs, being jealous because I cant get up on myself and rely on the help of others.

    "I don’t want to take out my negative feelings on my bf Ive been struggling with depression, PTSD, anxiety, and anger issues for a while now, and I keep feeling down and I dont know how to not take out my anger at my bf by getting snappy with him or saying something kind of mean. He knows all about it and hes been super patient with me, but I know its not something that should continue, regardless of him being alright with it at the time. So Im not sure what to do",
    "Successful, but what is the point? Im not sure what to do, so Im writing here. I am nearly 50 years old, and a nurse in a management position currently pursuing a higher degree. Ive been with my husband 30 years and we have grown children. By all accounts, Im successful. Life isnt perfect but it could be  and has been  worse. Much worse. But every day I cant shake the feeling that I just dont want to live. Ive had depression probably since high school, and it worsened during different life events, but nothing severe is happening now. During the worst of times, I didnt feel this strongly about life just being completely meaningless and, really... what the hell is the point? Its exhausting. Im finding myself just stuck at work, unable to be as productive as I need to be. But Im doing well in my college courses  straight As. And actually, I started pursuing a higher degree to give myself something else in my life  something that would help me not feel so hopeless, but oh boy has it NOT worked. I have been to counseling before, and it helped during that situation, but I honestly dont see how it will help me now. Before I started the college courses, I had found myself looking up how to hang myself on a doorknob. I know the warning signs of suicide  Im a nurse! I scared myself. So I started college. Now Im two semesters in, and just the other day I was considering how I could kill myself and make it look like an accident so my family wouldnt have to live with my suicide. Yet earlier today, I was laughing so hard I couldnt even tell the story about something funny my dogs did last night. Its amazing to me that I can be this absolutely hopeless, yet still laugh like that. So anyone else feel like this? Did you get past it? And how?",
    "I really need help I need help I have a step dad and a rather emotionless mother. Theyve always been very bossy in a way. By that I mean they do whatever they want to and they dont care about my opinion at all. And when I try to talk to them calmly they just say stuff like  This is how we are and you cant do anything about it. They also call me hopeless a lot of times and say personal things to me and this has always happened but I expected it to stop when I turned 18 a month back. Theyre currently angry at me and theyre blocking the wifi and my sim card for no apparent reason and I just feel so helpless. I cant talk to them or make them understand how I feel. When I told my mother that I have nobody in this house to talk to she said aw youve had such a sad childhood youre so innocent but im sorry thats just how it is. They take away my phone whenever theyre upset and Im stuck in the house because of quarantine and I just dont know what to do. And to make it a little clear, my real dad was an abusive alcoholic and my mother STILL says stuff like that to me. Ive also lost touch with almost every friend I have. I do talk to them but its empty talk. I only really have one person in my life that I can talk to, and that is my girlfriend. Just the thought of her not being there makes me feel so alone Can anyone who has been through the same stuff please guide me on what I can do? I feel so depressed and frustrated its killing me",
    "I might have depression... How do I go about getting help? My parents are very old school, they dont believe in mental health at all and if I go to a psychologist Ill have to go in secret. Im not even sure if our insurance covers mental health visits. If it doesnt I cant afford it, I have no money of my own. According to my parents this sadness is punishment for my past sins, if I didnt do so many bad things I wouldnt be feeling this way now. 3 years ago I begged my parents to take me to a psychologist and my parents were shocked and said our daughter is not crazy and shut down the topic as quickly as they could. Like end of discussion. This lead to my attempted suicide and even that they covered up, said to the emergency doctors that what happened just happened by accident. And that was that",

Then I see people around me that do not do shit and things seem to fall on their lap. They get bonus at work, the shares they bought made a crazy amount of money, family comes visit with amazing gifts for them, they get promotions at work while telling me they are putting the minimum effort on what they do... life in general seems to be so easy for them. I know I shouldnt compare. I know I should focus on the percentage I am better today when compared to me yesterday. But it is freaking hard. I feel like a huge failure in everything I touch or try to do. From money, work, health, family and friends relationships, I do not succeed in any of these areas.

My youngest just clings to me and is a very whiny child she hasnt socialised much because of the pandemic. I am finding the pandemic hard to deal with. Im alone. I have no friends to rely on. I dont leave the house. I have health issues, mental illness and Im exhausted. I also have anxiety with going outside now which wasnt as bad before. My mum tries to help out, but shes also a full time carer for my stepdad with cancer. My other family are far away. To add, because I see my mum during the week, I dont like going out places incase I catch anything and pass it onto my stepdad because of his immune system being low. I dont want to take the risk. My husband tries his best but seeing me upset like this is hurting him. He cant and I dont expect him to keep up with a full time job, all the household tasks, as well as helping with the children just because I cant manage. I feel like Im struggling and theres nothing to help. I have done countless rounds of therapy, and all sorts of medication to no avail only one was vaguely helpful and it just made me feel nothing rather than feeling sad.

I exercise, eat relatively healthily, maintain several close relationships with friends and family, take medication and vitamins, go to therapy, try to keep busy but not burn out... And Im still stuck. Theres no situational issues or any residual trauma that makes me feel this way. Ive just always been depressed, which runs in my family. It makes me think of the quote, The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. I feel like Im just working WAY too hard to stay afloat, doing the same things every day and expecting that eventually Ill feel better. I dont want to give up. Im NOT going to give up.

Ive lost all but few friends now that Im desperately holding on too, but I just dont know if I can continue to deal with this pain because no matter how man counselors or therapists Ive seen it alway just seems to never get better. I mean Ive tried alternatives by listening to music, playing video games, livestreaming to twitch, watching YouTube to help, never really satisfies me.

Sure I smile and pretend Im ok to everyone I know. I get myself to work each day too, but only because its a routine. Pretty much twelve months ago something happened that triggered me to be bad enough that I couldnt sleep and I was having panic attacks about nothing. So I finally saw a doctor and she diagnosed me with anxiety, depression and stress... And referred me to see a psychologist but Ive had bad experiences with councilors when I was really bad at uni. So I got anxious about it and never went. I didnt want to be judged for what happened either. Ive tried to reach out to my partner, but she has anxiety too. If I lean on her too much she drops her bundle. She tells me shes happy and relentlessly reminds me that she wants to get married and have kids because were getting older. Ive told her that Im not having kids until I feel better, then I smile once and some how in her mind that makes me better. Otherwise we work really well together, except I never really feel like I feel in love with her. 7 years on Im still waiting for that spark. My family is fine, nothing bad ever really happened and we all talk, but it feels like they wouldnt notice if I wasnt around. They are so self obsessed, they call me to whine about the mundane things in there lives but never really ask how I am or if they do dont listen to what I have to say. I hate my job, sure most people do, but I find it so sole destroying. Feeling so shitty, I find it impossible to apply for others. I feel so trapped. I dont really have any friends I feel I can trust. At any rate I never let them see the depressed me, just my well practiced smiling facade. Ultimately I feel so incredibly lonely and isolated.

I am still at the early stages so I wont have a definitive diagnosis for a quite some time still. What is certain is that there is something really wrong with me. Most of it originates from my horrible childhood and upbringing. Only the MDD was actually caused by the breakup. Still, my ex thinks she and the breakup are the main causes of my current state, but that is simply not true. Of course, I cannot tell her as she wont speak to me nor believe me. ampx200B Now here is my dilemma I feel the pressure to move forward with my life.

    "How to deal with the cyclical triad of draining symptoms Over the past months my depression has progressively become more disruptive. Im now to the point where Im stuck in a cycle of anxiety during the day, insomnia at night, and anhedonia all throughout the day. Its definitely affected my work as I know and feel Im not as efficient and poignant as I used to be, and I fear that Ill lose my job due to lackluster work. Outside of increasing my SSRI dose with my doc, how can I overcome this if I cant find therapy right now due to pandemic? Much of my depression I feel comes from loneliness. Im a man in my late 20s and Ive never had a true best friend or romantic partner. I hoped this year would be that year because I found a job in a city I wanted to live, and it felt like a chance at renewed life. I accepted before the shutdown, and started after restrictions were in place, so Ive spent the entire year alone in a new city as all social avenues were cut off. I almost have no socialization with coworkers either due to working remotely. I tried online dating, but that made things worse as I didnt match with anyone and sent me on a selfdoubting downward spiral. I just want to find someone that I can share a true connection with, but I dont think that opportunity will come for a long time.",
    "I am sad, alone and scared. Ive never been properly diagnosed with depression but I am currently feeling very depressed. A few years ago when I was younger amp my parents were going through a divorce I was severely miserable, would have large bouts of anxiety amp often contemplated ending my life. It was a sad time in my life but I am glad to say that I got through it and have been doing great for the most part and have hardly felt anxious since. However recently I have been feeling really down amp depressed. All I want to do is sleep and I eat because I am sad and bored, and then I become sad because I eat too much. I have gained weight and am so insecure. I have been skipping my uni classes because I have no friends there and my degree is hard and it all makes me so sad. With all my friends heading in different directions I just feel so alone. I think my family have noticed and say things that are kind of cruel, but I know they mean well. They think I have obsessive compulsive tendencies because I tend to pick at my face often amp struggle to stop. I just dont want to let anyone down amp I am afraid to take the steps to become better because I know it will disappoint my family if I decide to leave uni for example. But most importantly Im scared of going back to how I was years ago, I never want to feel that way again. Ive never reached out for professional help either and dont have the money for therapy. Part of me would feel also ashamed in a way if I got professional help. I hate the idea that something may actually be wrong with me, and I hate the idea of having to take meds. I just feel so lost and conflicted. I feel like I know what I need to do but its so hard to do it and remain consistent. If anyone has any advice at all it would greatly appreciated.

His family and friends went along with it but none of them is willing to apologize or acknowledge any wrongdoing. His mother told me, Being nice is overrated. I am so sad I dont want to live anymore. I dont know how to cope with the suffering I experience on a daily basis. Ill appreciate any advice you have for me.",
    "Haven't been working for 2 months, I've been bed bound--stsrting my first shift now Hi all, Ive recently started working again after being out of it for 2 months. I was mainly bed bound, sleeping most of the day away, spent most of my time smoking. I wasnt still kinda not? eating properly, barely doing dishes, laundry, and it was such an effort to shower and brush my teeth. I have to be able to pay bills though  So I ask now, how to I push through and maintain this job? I already have extreme anxiety about starting a new job, it makes me feel physically sick and I start to uncontrollably bite my fingernails. Whats left of them anyway. Any support, kind words of encouragement, or advice starting a job when youre transitioning from bed bound depression.",
    "I don't have anything, no future and just.. yeah. I look down on myself, I feel like this waste of space lazy piece of shit. I just dont know what to do anymore, I just feel like anything I try or will ever try will be meaningless. I feel like Im constantly in an endless void, like stuck in the middle of the sea while unable to swim. ampx200B If I try to find love, it can only be online and they will always have zero interest in meeting the real me. So it will always be the same result just a different person. If I try to further my education, I cant ever stay focus enough to make any progress and that always repeat. If I work more I feel more stress out about everything and grow more depress. If stay where I am, Im constantly being looked down on and be called lazy. Im growing older and fatter, I dont have anything or able to gain nothing. I do not know what do anymore and taking my own life is constantly feel like the best solution to end the madness. ampx200B",
    "Life’s going downhill and everything that happens is mainly my fault For starters Im 13 years old. Im in the 7th grade and this issue has been going on for what Id say about a year now. I dont know if whats going on even is depression, maybe Im just being edgy. To be frank, I have no idea anymore. The more I stress about it the more I try talking about it with my friends, and sometimes they ignore it, other times they tell me to stop being emo. Also, FYI, this will be really long. The fact of the matter is that things havent been going well. We can start at my grades. You see, my brother age 25 is a collage dropout and my sister age 21 is still doing great and Im happy for her. The thing is that because my brother had dropped out of collage he has a job now and is starting to get back on track and is still living with my parents and struggling, I feel this pressure that I need to do well and be the best I can to not end up like him. Im sure thats normal, but the one problem is my mother. I always try to satisfy her, seeing the smile and satisfaction on her face is my dream, but she never seems to be satisfied. If I brought home Bs that wasnt good enough. If I got an answer wrong on my test even though I still got a good grade it wasnt good enough because I got something wrong. When I brought home my interim, I got 3 Bs and 4 As and when she saw, all she did was ask if I needed help because my grades were dropping. It hurt me. She wants me to become an orthodontist. When I brought home this report thingie on my level 15 on english and writing, I got a level 5. Only 7 of students in my state got that. However there was also one for science and math, I got a level 4 on that, which is what most people in my state got. When she saw, she told me to do better because I math and science are more important for becoming a orthodontist. I feel helpless. My next issue is this incident that happened with my crush.",
    "I genuinely wanna be happy. Tips? So I have severe anxiety and depression. Nothing traumatic happened to me, a lot of my family has this. I take medicine however, I dont want to rely on this all the time. Lately I have been struggling a lot with overthinking. On my relationship especially but, mostly in general. I wake up filled with anxiety and my heart racing, and its gotten to a point I feel physically sick. Ive tried yoga, working out, etc but it doesnt help for long. Does anyone have tips? Genuinely good ones that work? Thank you.",
    "r/depression is telling unwell people incredibly evil things. I know this is not the same group, but Im absolutely shocked at and have noone to talk about regarding this. They tell a mentally unwell person with relationship problems that a the solution is to perpetually hate, and b They should never have children as that will merely perpetuate their misery.

My therapist is getting me to switch therapists since hes retiring but I really liked him and I feel bad for it, but Im resistant to getting a new therapist. I dont want to be.

    "Depression Help, But From the Other Side. My SO is bipolar and their depression can be triggered by almost anything. They put on a good face with most people but take a lot out on me. I worry about them and do what I can to make it things as stress free as possible for them. I cook, clean, do laundry. Taking them things to work when they want. Offer support. Try to understand them, but that gets difficult sometimes. The relationship isnt good, they dont appreciate what I try to contribute especially when depressed, and it leaves me feeling not only on my own, worst off because Im caring almost full time to them. This is kind of a rant, but I need help helping them while striking a balance for myself because Im quite burnt out getting no reciprocity in the relationship.",
    "I don’t feel like I’m enough and I need help Since the age of like 11 I would often get waves of depression and anxiety suddenly. Im mostly fine for a majority of the time and after each wave I try to pick myself up and go on like nothing happened, but anything either I or anyone else does could get me back down the same rabbit hole of wanting to die. My current theory is it stems from stress related issues caused by a dysfunctional household earlier in my life because of my parents divorce. It was rather messy, mostly because of my father. With these waves of depression I often find myself getting very paranoid that people are speaking about me behind my back and that everyone hates me. I also start to believe that Im absolutely worthless and a pile of living garbage. I get really distant from my friends and family and my immediate reaction is to block them on all social medias and not talk or look at them. Lastly, while these waves happen with no pattern that I could sense I always seem to carry this guilt and shame of my past which leads to my almost always sad behavior. If anyone has any advice please help, Im so tired and I have no hope.",

    "Should I keep checking in on a guy I dated for 4 months who disclosed he is depressed? I F28 have been single for 5 years and I know what assholes guys can be. But this boy was something else. Intiative, social, funny but deep down sweet and sensitive. He told me that winter gets to him and after a month he was starting to show signs of not sleeping and e.g. told that he didnt leave the house during the week but to go to supermarket. I started to get worried when he suddenly cancelled our weekend plans, and I said that it would be nice to know if he didnt want to see me anymore. He replied immediately that it wasnt about that and I told him to concact me again when hes feeling better. After a week he contacted me and I decided to give him another change. Then after a month he started to be again disconnected and finally I told him to come meet me and asked whats going on. He said that he has been feeling depressed for few years, but has now seeked for help. He hasnt told anyone else. I needed answers whether we had future together, which was maybe bad, since he had just come out of the depression closet for the first time ever... We decided that we wouldnt continue the dating. We both cried but I was pissed off due to the distant behavior that had been going on without excuses. I have now been texting him once a week. I started to get worried when he was saying that he hasnt really seen friends or doing anything. He still doesnt want to see me, even tho he said that some day he will when hes feeling better. His replies started to get more short and take more time. Now hes not answering every time. I asked if I was bothering him and that I could stop, but he sid that it wasnt about that. I asked if I could send him a text once a week that he would just open. He didnt reply. I have my own anxiety specially since we were dating and dont know whether I should keep texting him or not. There is mixed advice everywhere whether to not give up on a depressed or to give the person space. Sigh.",
    "What is wrong with me? How can I go from content to suicidal in a couple of hours? I dont want to do anything. When Im forced to leave the house or get the courage to do so, I dont feel as trapped anymore. When Im around people who dont know about how Im doing, I seem to pull myself together and act normal. I can smile, laugh and make jokes and it feels good. But as soon as I come home, I just dont want to exist at all anymore. I feel so alone even though I know that there are people I could reach out to. Its scary and it feels like Im just making this all up because misery just feels so familiar to me.

    "Am I Disabled Enough? So it sounds like a joke but this is a true anxiety. My story without getting into it because its not the point just so you understand where Im from. Warning for all kinds of trauma. I live in Australia and I grew up in an abusive house. Mum would verbally attack my dad and the kids, hed get drunk and beat her in front of us and around and around we go. Mum finally left him for good when I was 8 because my eldest sister turned fourteen and declared she wasnt going back and would keep me and my other sister with her at the halfway house. So mum got a government funded house and took off in search of a good time and a new husband leaving my two older sisters to raise me. they were 14 and 12 to my 8 at the time. Left alone days at a time, my sisters pulled cash in hand work to feed us. My dad got visiting rights so when we went over there we were fed and clothed and he spoilt us rotten especially me but in unhealthy amounts. eventually my sisters stopped going but I loved it because there I could stay up as late as I want never bathe eat myself sick on junk and watch whatever adult tv I wanted. All I had to do was agree mum was a Btch and leave dad alone to do whatever he wanted. meanwhile at mums place she found a miner to latch too with three kids of his own. so now we were six kids between 143 being left alone days at a time and sharing one room. two years later my elder sisters ran away, my father cut contact as it was too much to deal with my mother trying to see me which i learnt to forgive him as an adult but as a kid it hurt and we were in a slightly bigger house. it was me and my step sister in one room, my two step brothers in another and my parents in the last. again, my mother was not present, either sleeping, or out socialising or gambling or in the shed smoking. my dad either worked or joined her. Now I was the caretaker. Needless to say various abuse emotional verbal occasionally physical and by my teens Im pretty messed up. I latch onto my own escape in the form of my high school boyfriend.",

Hello guys, It must be like three days that Im registered on Reddit sorry if I say something weird or wrong, english isnt my first language, you can correct me if there is a mistake and you feel like it, thats not a problem I hope and I was trying to give an advice to people like just an advice that I believed was good to follow if a person was in a bad situation with someone with wrong intentions someday. My point was only to help, and I never said in the comment in question that Ive got all the knowledge in the world and that my advice was an order or whatever. But yet, somebody just told me that I should not have said what I said the advice because in her case which was a very bad one, like a situation I hope nobody would live, even if I know that everyday people unfortunately experience it and I had too, but I never said that in my comment or in reply to her because I didnt have to and whatever and I felt really attacked by her. Because she made me really feel like a bad person, as if I was even coupable of what would have happen to her in the past, and she told that BECAUSE she did not do what I was giving as an advice, she lived. But if she did what I have said, she would have been dead, and she made me feel really guilty about it. The point is, that I was just trying to help and she didnt have to talk to me like that. I didnt knew where to post what I am posting right now, because for the record, Ive been depressed for more than ten years and I experienced like, almost one time a year one time could be hours, days, weeks or months of me feeling like I really should kill myself.

Not to feel better about myself, but because I want to help as many people as I can and I know that it could help.",

    "I don't feel original anymore. When I was in high school a few years back, I was one of the highest competitors in my school. I joined the high school band in freshman year and by senior year I became one of the best in my section. My academics were always straight and I exercised daily. Senior year I enlisted in the military and now I believe it was one of my worst decisions in life. Before I went to boot camp I was motivated, a patriot and believed that the elite joined the military. In senior year I never applied for any scholarships and I was offered one but turned it down because I already signed the papers. I thought I set myself up for success. Now I believe I was dead wrong for joining. The only benefit I see so far after a year and a half of service is that Im trying to set myself up financially before I get out and hopefully attend college. It sounds like a plan but I feel no happiness from what I do at all. I convinced myself theres no honor in it anymore, its just another job. I dont exercise by myself anymore. I feel like Im not progressing anywhere in life being in service. Im just a body and if I wasnt here doing what Im doing, thered just be somebody else doing the exact same. Im replaceable. Thats the mindset the military gave me. I look forward to going back home in 6 months for vacation and thats the only thing Ive been looking forward to since Ive been stationed. After that, the only thing I have my eyes on are getting out of service, going home, being closer to my family again. Theres nothing here that satisfies me and I hate it. I feel like Ive tried everything to be happy here but it seems impossible. I wish somebody could help.",

But now it feels like everyone is just a huge jerk, and Im the worst person in the world for daring to move to their country. Theyre expats too! Its making me feel so terrible. I havent been able to get out of bed for days. I wake up in the night sobbing. Ive stopped eating. I feel like Im not wanted in this country. Im feeling so stupid for thinking that moving here was a good idea. I feel stupid for being upset about it too.

    "I need help While in the bootcamp, we rarely talked, living our separate lives. After I graduated bootcamp I moved to Washington State, to gain some world experience and she did the same thing, but interning in the Caribbean as a marine biology instructor. I started at this time having extremely unhealthy night terrors. I was still madly in love with her, I had a ring in mind from our first relationship and one night was exceedingly bad. The next morning I told myself that I would reach out to her, tell her the truth of what I was feeling. So I did. I told her about how much I missed her, my night terrors, why we separated and my insecurities about how she was feeling at the time. And I told her that I still loved her and either needed her in my life or I had to completely cut her out because my mental health was really bad. These night terrors are demons like no other. I hop no one has to be afraid to sleep because they may experience watching and hearing their ex get railed by guy after guy. It truly is a haunting experience. After I reached out she told me she had missed me, and felt the same. We talked about what things would be different and how we would be able to go on from there. She had 2 months left in her internship before she came back to the states. During this time we talked about the future, where she wanted to work, when we could see each other again, things we could do etc etc... The reason it was difficult is because I landed a job as a software developer in idaho that only pays 52yr. So plane tickets from Kentucky arent the cheapest. I also got us a hotel room and tickets to see one of our favorite bands tame impala. Well. When the day finally came where she returned to the states something happened. She did a complete 180 and told me she no longer wanted a relationship and wanted to be independent to travel the world and teach Marine biology. I was always supportive of this idea but the way she described it to me seemed that instead of a partner, I was more of an obstacle. And she eventually ended the relationship. I was hurt, really really bad.",

    "Hey. Hi. I wanted to reach out. To have a genuine interaction with another person. No pretenses or ulterior motives. Im on the balcony of a hotel in Thailand and looking out at that long drop, it just makes me wonder what if. I dont know if Ive ever felt as lost as I do tonight. In my cynicism I fear that people dont actually genuinely carefor others, me included, and why would they eh? Does that kind of warmth and love exist in the world outside of fairytales and movies? I have these doubts so I really dont reach out usually, even to the people I surround myself with. But right now maybe Im chasing rainbows again, but Id like some genuine communication, even if its on the internet and under the mask of anonymity. If anyone would care. If you would take the time to hear me. Im 22. I live in South Korea and Ive been quite sad, depressed, since the 9th grade. Its been 8 years. I feel like Ive lost a lot of what made me me in that time. I feel like an empty shell. All the color and life sucked out and nothing but an empty husk left. Yet despite all that Ive lost, I believe I have much more to lose still, because I have despaired before, believing Ive hit rock bottom. Then time would pass and Id look back, only to realize how much I had back then. When I first started to have depressing thoughts, self doubt, existential problems, I turned to my family for help. My mother, father and sister. Why? because theyre my family, and I thought it would matter to them that I, their son, was suffering so genuinely, in so much pain and doubt. When I was so lost and confused and desperately reaching out to them, they fucking turned their back on me. Or so I felt, back then and I still do. I felt so betrayed that the people I loved and trusted the most in the world would do that so I became bitter and made a promise to myself that Id never share my life with them again.",

    "Ever since I came out to my dad, he’s convinced I shouldn’t be depressed anymore. I came out to my dad as Agender about... 3 months ago? I think? Either way, hes not respecting me at all, and thinks that now that Ive come out, he can still call me by sheher pronouns and act like Im a girl, while Im also okay and experience no Gender Dysphoria at all.

Dont really know what the point of this was, just wanted to put it out there that if anyone has any suggestions, it would be cool to hear them.",
    "What can I do to help my family member My brother needs help. Im not sure where to start. He has been drinking pretty heavily for years. Recently he did get help and was put on meds but when the prescription ran out he didnt get another for weeks, has new meds now but hates taking them due to being drowsy and finding hard to function at work. Ive recently moved in with him. I cook and clean for him, chat to him when he wants to chat. He says he doesnt need help or he cant be helped, that hes independent but does thank me any time I do stuff for him. I want to show him hes loved and tell him this. He thinks Im being emotional and not to worry about him. Ive suggested trying different meds, going with him to talk to someone, taking time off work to trial different meds, he agrees he needs time off though feels bad to his team at work amp his boss. I guess I just need advice on what I can do to help and not be overbearing or annoying to him. Hes gotten a lot worse these past few weeks and I cant help but think Its my fault or Im doing something wrong. I cant say Ive ever been in his position so Im at a loss on what to do.",

I flinch at every sound and getting kicked out of my sleep even its just the crackling of the wooden floor. I am afraid of opening doors because I am scared of opening doors, because I fear there is something in the room, waiting for me. It all started with one crappy horror movie which was not even scary.

    "Am I a sociopath...? This is a throwaway account. So, I have been struggling with depression for quite some time now, and I am very very concerned that I may be beginning to show sociopathic tendencies. I have a friend, who, for anonymities sake, shall remain nameless. He is my best friend, and has been for a long time. But lately, I have noticed that I feel almost like I want to know everything he does and when he does it, and he is part of a group that I recently left, and is, in fact,in a leadership position there. I left for several accumulative reasons, but one of them was because since he was in a leadership position, we where not able to converse at the group. It was hard for both of us, but we tried to follow the rules. After I left, I started having trouble with the nights that the meetings where taking place, like it was hard for me to accept the he was still there and I wasnt. Im also noticing that when we have something planned and he backs out because of, for example, work, I find that I am way more bothered by that than I should be. So, am I a sociopath, and what can I do to stop these tendencies? Thanks in advance. Tim not my real name, of course",
    "I think I'm severely depressed and I don't know how to fix it. First things first I created this account because I dont feel comfortable using my regular one, and this is the first post Im making with it, but Ive been a Redditor for the better part of a decade. Please dont hold my desire to remain anonymous against me. Thank you. Now that thats out of the way, heres why Im posting Im a 45yearold guy and only now have realized that Im just sitting around waiting to die. Most people wouldnt know that by looking at me though, because on the surface Im a happy, friendly, outgoing person, but on the inside I just feel empty and hopeless. I cant sleep, Ive overeaten to the point of morbid obesity, I have no friends, my relationship with my wife feels distant, I dont get out and go anywhere, I dont exercise, I have no career ambitions even though I have a steady job, and I just generally have given up on everything and I feel like Im just going through the motions. Its been like that for years. I lost my dad in the 90s, my mom died 12 years ago, my fatherinlaw died a year after that, my brother has stopped speaking with me, I broke my leg a few years ago and it never healed back as well as I wish it had, I hurt all of the time, and my quality of life has plummeted. I know I need to seek help, but I dont know how to go about it without feeling like a failure. The idea of medication repulses me, and opening myself up to a total stranger seems like a nonstarter, so I dont know what I should do. As a result, Ive done nothing, and my health is only getting worse. If anyone has ever been in shoes like mine, how did you fix the problem? What did you do to change? How can I even get motivated to seek help and support when I cant even motivate myself to exercise, eat healthy, or talk about stuff like this with my wife? I just feel like Im surrounded by dead ends and all I can do is fake it until death finally solves my problems for me.",
    "Friend committed suicide during quarantine and I feel myself backsliding I dont really have a whole lot to say. Ive struggled with depression most of my life. I was actually starting to really deal with a lot of my problems and was sort of discovering my will to live and fight for myself. I think its still there, but it feels like a plane whos propellers are more often off than on. In any case, a friend of mine who was living in my old room committed suicide and Ive been struggling ever since. I dont feel like I can reach out to my friends because I already exploded on one of them and I think they are wary of me. I can just tell theyre all walking on eggshells and I hate feeling this fragile and out of control. Ive isolated myself to keep it from happening again. The thing I didnt expect is how angry I am. I have been having like violent visions and thats not really something thats ever happened to me before. Thats the part that I dont feel like I can share with anyone. When I look at my anger from a more logical perspective, I know its not justified, and yet thats often not enough to make it go away. I feel like Im fighting for my life because of this. And to be honest one of the things that has kept me from doing anything is knowing how much Ive been traumatized by this and the fact that I really wouldnt wish this on anyone else. I dont know what Im looking for, but if there is someone out there whos dealt with this and can offer me some advice?",

I go to one of the top universities in North America and am currently in my 5th year. These past 2 years have had me feeling really low and Ive been thinking about seeing a therapist because I may have depression. I feel very demotivated and tired even though my work load is insane and I cant afford to slack. Often times I feel very worthless, a burden, and a waste of space. I also binge eat which makes those feelings worse. The eating has gotten a LOT better but it still had its moments. Anyway, Ive been wanting to sew a therapist but I need insurance which had been kind of holding me back. My dads insurance covers the whole family I live at home, for cultural reasons but he and my mom would be able to see who uses it. After a year, the feelings got worse and I made the decision, after much deliberation, to tell my mom that I would like to see a therapist and that I would like to use the insurance. She said okay and j started looking but most were fully booked or not taking new patients. Today, we were discussing my sisters divorce. Her ex had depression and was one of the reasons they got a divorce. My mom says that anyone who has depression shouldnt get married, and that it applies to me. She said that she thinks Im faking it for attention because its not visible to her. She said if I do think I have it, I should forget about finding love or getting married. I interpreted her words to mean that people it depression are unworthy of love and that I would ruin someones life like my sisters ex ruined hers.

And if on mt special day nothing changes, then will anything ever really change? I decided no, and I made my final decision on whether or not i should follow through with whats been on my mind. And i decided I will. There is no point, Im not happy and im always alone. This is my goodbye. I am posting this in the hopes that maybe someone will care. In the hopes that maybe someone will try to stop me, but I dont think thats what will happen. No body seems to really care about me these days. Im just another guy on the street to everyone.

They said thats just life, theres always something to get in your way but you have to do it regardless, but I couldnt cope with that anymore, I couldnt cope with that awful reality. I just didnt enjoy living anymore, and if its this bad now as only a highschooler I couldnt imagine myself being older, in an actual work environment where the same problems persisted. I wanted it to end so badly, nothing was improving and the foreseeable future looked awful and stressful. I promised myself that if it got this bad again Id ask to see a therapist again, it took a couple weeks. Sometime towards the end of next week I learned that I was also taking the SAT another standardized test infamous for not working in the southeast in about ten days, leaving me with not nearly as much time to prepare as I thought. I broke down completely, preparing for the AP exam took enough out of me alone, but two of them back to back was a death sentence for me. I kept crying over the idea that it got worse again, that whenever I thought I was at rock bottom it just kept going downhill, no mtter what I did I would continue to feel awful about living itself. I laid out a ten day study plan to go through, saying that in ten days it would be over and the better times everyone talked about would finally be here, it hurts to say but I dont think thats happening.

    "Thought I would share this here Hi, my name is Sebastian and I really dont know how to start this post, maybe because Im afraid to be called whiny or whatever, but the truth is Ive been feeling pretty down recently so I thought I would share what Ive been feelingthinking this past 3 months or so. It is a well known fact that 2020 has been nothing short of horrible, but the reality is that, for me at least , it didnt start that way. Beginning of 2020 was maybe the best Ive ever felt in my life. To provide a little more context, Im 19 rn, but back at January February I was still 18 and about to graduate from high school which I eventually did, with good grades, but heres the issue I graduated from a international German school which educates based on the German system Abitur which in short were some difficult exams that I studied my ass of to pass. Abitur also presented me with the possibility of going abroad for college. All my short life Ive felt kinda pressured to go abroad to study, since my father did it and always talked about how amazing it was, and my school was filled with posters of study in Europemostly Germany its a life changing experience. And so I felt on top of my game and started among at the very top architecture in such places like Madrid,Berlin,Stuttgart,etc but most of all I wanted Barcelona because it felt so perfect on paper, like the best of the best , world wide known, top level technology, state of the art campus, and of course the city itself is an architectural delight arguably the most famous architect , Gaudí is from Barcelona. Looking back now, I was naive and didnt appreciate what I had back home , but I had to prove the ones who bullied and looked down on me back in my school days , that I was better than them, and that was my first of many mistake I went there looking for revenge so to speak. Then everything developed so quickly I had barely any time to think , to my awe I got accepted in BarcelonaTech, I found a nice little bedroom on a student housing that was just beside Campus and I started preparing for my departure , which was going to be mid September bc the University had arranged some introdution activities for new comers. It all seemed perfect, like it was made FOR me.",

    "Every night just before drifting off to sleep, I'm overwhelmed with feelings of self hate and guilt. Im a seasoned pro in dealing with depression but this is getting out of hand. It used to happen every once in a while, but now its consistent every night. As I lay here with my eyes closed and I begin to dream, suddenly I realize Im a horrible employee and Im on the verge of losing my job. Or Im a horrible father and my son deserves better. Or Im a horrible husband who should have let someone better marry my wife and make her happy. Or I suddenly realize my finances are messed up for someone my age. Or I feel like Im the worst kind of friend. The tremendous feeling of guilt is absolutely overwhelming and I wake up and have to often times sit up, my heart pounding like crazy. The house is a mess, Ive been working on the same task too long at work and theyre going to find out Im a fraud, I have a ton of yard work I need to do and the neighbors think Im a total slob, my son doesnt feel loved and needs better things in life. The list expands exponentially if I let it, even as I type it out its flowing in like a river of crippling worry, my face is completely bloodshot like Im embarrassed, and I cant catch my breath. All I want to do is go on facebook and tell everyone how sorry I am for being so embarrassing. Or go sit at my desk and work more so I have more to report on in the standup. Or go lay with my 4 year old son and tell him how proud of him I am and how great his Lego creation tonight was. Or clean and organize the whole house so my wife wakes up and feels good about being married to me.

I have a intp cousin she knows me well and is a loving sister but her life is already very shity and i cant bring myself to talk to her out of guilt. I consider myself as a very privileged person and by that I mean that I have a loving family a secure house food on my plate clean water and just I have everything better than everyone around me and I just feel like a burden and failure everyone is trying so hard for me I dont even know what I am depressed about... I sometimes fear that I am making this all up and that my subconscious is telling me t do this for attention... i am sick of worrying people I care about. I need professional help and i know that but it is complicated. I just keep having meltdowns and just feel like someone is always constantly standing on my chest . I just feel like I am becoming a ungrateful unhumble piece of shit who does nothing but complain and become a burden or pain in someones life. I wont lie I think about dying a lot awful lot but I know I wont commit suicide as I have a strict code of conduct and my morals dont allow me to commit suicide unless it is to save a innocent person. I need advice from someone who thinks like me or just can help me out and is emotionally stable themselves I really dont want to become a emotional mess with a lot of ego... it is taking me a lot to post this would appreciate sincere piece of advice a lot.

    "My mom puts her boyfriend ahead of me and I’m losing my mind So no one in my nuclear family really cares for me. If anything they all have been my abusers at some point and just seem to take turns. My mom right now seems to be the main one. She has her boyfriend over who is a POS in my eyes thinks its ok to say the nword, asked if my best friend whos Muslim was going to blow up the gas station and I tell her that I dont like him and I dont think hes a good person. She gets all mad and says that I dont know him and I should respect him because she loves him and its been such a longtime since someone loved her like that. I feel like shes so fucking stupid and if I say her down to talk to her she would get all defensive and kick me out again. She always seems to place him before me which genuinely hurts and she seems to have no concern for me. She has this thing that she thinks is really funny where its her just yelling at me and tell me I didnt do something right, and I see everyone else look down. Our relationship is seriously strained and their relationship had issues around the same time. She ran to him crying on the daily, even driving past where he lives. I had to reach out to her. She yells at me all the time because hell talk to her and say that he doesnt feel like hes part of the family there is no family. Im always pushing for a healthier relationship with my mom and she puts him in front of me no questions asked. I already want to fucking kill myself, and I battle thoughts about my worth all the time but it doesnt help with my mom yelling at me for being disrespectful to him when I say something shes just not used to hearing. Im so angry at her and Im angry at myself because I keep letting her hurt me. This whole situation fucks with my self worth. I just cant seem to get to a point in my life where I am able to completely cut my parents off. Please help.",
    "I don't know what to do at this point other than end it. Nothing has helped so far. He then insisted that if I did that, he wouldnt love me anymore. I was terrified of being abandoned by the love of my life, and sex was the only form of intimacy I knew at this point, so I didnt want to lose the only things I cared about. I kept doing it for him. It would make me cry and have panic attacks and occasionally throw up, but he didnt stop. I kept telling him that it was okay because I didnt want him to leave me. I developed severe anorexia because of this. I havent told anyone about it because I dont want professionals to get rid of it. Its a comfort for me I need to be as skinny as possible. I cannot be fat or I will kill myself. I also dont have time to be hospitalized for something like this right now. I am in the midst of scholarship applications and making money for college. Now that I am skinny, I am severely paranoid that he loves me less and doesnt like the way that I look. He has admitted both of those things. When hes in a bad mood, hell insult me about how Im not sexually good enough for him anymore and that my body is ugly because Im so skinny. I dont feel good enough, because I clearly am not. He reassures me that he still loves me personality and my face but frankly thats really shitty, if you ask me. The fat fetish thing doesnt happen anymore, but Im not good enough for him now. Im too scared to leave though. He has been my best friend for like, a decade. I dont want to lose what weve had. This is the biggest problem I face right now aside from the abuse I endure from my mom. This is the reason I had attempted suicide, both times. I was drugged and violently raped at a party by one of my friends at 16 while everyone was sleeping. I dont really want to talk about that one. It was just rape, I guess. Uncomfortable situation. It was the least emotionally taxing of the three, though. I have CPTSD.",
    "35M in dire need of support/advice Hi everyone. It is my last resort posting on here but I just dont know what else to do? Ive been struggling to keep things together the last few days. Today I just broke down as I couldnt keep things together no more. First of all Im a mature normal person other then my mental health problems. I am on meds and see my doctor regularly. Just today I had a breakdown. Id rather not contact emergency or go to the hospital as Ive been there before an they hold me from going outside. I have payments to make and cannot afford to be held in hospital as this will screw things up even more. I live in a small town out in the country. Tonight I decided to go out for a walk, I end up in the ditch just watching the stars is where I am now. I am feeling empty, I cant help it but fall into tears, I just dont know what to do. Im also feeling alittls suicidal but not the biggest risk just yet. Just looking for advice or someone I could chat with? Feel free to pm me. Thanks.",
    "Alone I really need some help, I cant sleep anymore, I feel like I want to die but I dont have enough motivation, Im slowly losing all of my interests and everything hurts, my body is in constant physical and mental pain, I never feel any positive emotions anymore, if I feel it for even a second a day its an honest achievement but I have nowhere to go for this, I dont want to dump this on the people I care about, because it would be awful to do considering people are dealing with their own problems, but I just need someone to talk to, especially knowing Im not the only one out there that feels like this is a slight relief knowing that Im not completely alone in this world, and if youve read all the way through to here thank you, and I hope you are doing well, and if you need someone to talk to, Ill listen to me if youll listen to me .

    "I'm about to go to the hospital for my mental health Im really scared even though its something I need to do. My depression almost got me yesterday but I was able to be calmed down I should have gone to the hospital yesterday but I was able to convince my friend to let me wait for today, but now that its today Im still terrified to go I would be going all by myself and I dont have cell service so I wouldnt know if I could talk to any of my friends for support while I was there. Im just Im really afraid anyone who has gone to the hospital for their depression and mental health how was it?",
    "I'm feeling really down I rarely ever get my hopes up and recently made a mistake and did so. Ive been trying really hard to improve my family and my life. I applied and interviewed for a better paying position at my job. I was told by many that they thought for certain I has it and I began to think so as well. Well unfortunately I was not selected. It devastated me. I really had a lot put on this. My family and I have been living in a income based complex and its definitely not safe. Theres been several shootings, drug dealers, our car windows were shot out last summer. So I was counting on this promotion to get my family out! So Im feeling down and overwhelmed all at once between not getting the promotion, tending to have seasonal depression anyways, struggling with buying Christmas, and my sons birthday also being in December. My boss said theyd have something for me soon.. Im afraid to get my hopes up again. I feel like my performance that got me even considered for the position is lacking because I am down and no longer have the positive feeling I had.",
    "A bit of a strange case: Exercise has DESTROYED my mental health. Thoughts? Advice? First, some basic health data about myself Age16 SexMale Height 510 WeightAround 142145 pounds Ever since the summer of 2019, exercise has been a huge part of my life. My main fitness goal was gaining muscle, so I was doing strength training with weights around three to four times a week. But I also wanted to be able to eat a lot of food and generally have a relaxed diet at the same time. A big reason for that was because my sister had recently recovered from severe anorexia, so my father thought that it would be wise for me to not trigger her and potentially provoke a relapse by following a restrictive dietby restrictive I mean eliminating junk food, soft drinks, etc. Because of this, I started doing a lot of cardio, and I really mean a lot. I started out with around 30 minutes of running every other day, but I gradually added more cardio over time. My peak was during the summer of 2020, when I was doing around 2 and a half hours of cardio every other day, in addition to 10 minutes of HIIT on my strength training days. When school started, I cut the duration down to the following routine alternating between 1 hour of strength training plus 35 minutes of cardio and 95 minutes of cardio every other day. Then, in January 2021, I got a severe knee injury from doing calf raises. Little did I know the day that I injured myself that, from that point on I would descend into the darkest, most hellish part of my 16 years on this Earth. You have to understand that Id made exercise an essential part of my life. If I didnt complete my exercise, I would fall into a pretty bad mood, sometimes for the rest of the day. So when I injured my knee, I was extremely disappointed. Every form of cardio which Id been doing and enjoyedbiking and running was off the table. Judging from prior experience, swimming was also not an option, because I found itand still do super boring and torturous. My last cardio option was the rowing machine. I replaced my bikingrunning with rowing. The problem was that I HATED rowing, even. more than I hated swimming.",
    "At risk of losing the only thing I have left... Please help :( Sorry it's a long one I lost my job. I am being evicted. I have a 5 year old living with me and an 11 year old who doesnt. And my boyfriend is now saying he wants to move back home to Norway... I have no idea what to do, Im a complete mess and feel like my life is at a cross roads. One leads to potentially hurting my daughters, one leads to a literal dead end for me... which will hurt them more. ampx200B Bit of a background Im 31, been abused my entire life, by parents, by siblings, by random strangers and ex partners. Ive been in abusive relationships, mentally and emotionally abused, sexually abused at least 5 or 6 times... Ive been raped. I lost custody of my eldest daughter because her father kidnapped her after I tried seeking help for her anger issues. He refused to bring her home after a visit and the Social Services let him get away with it. My youngest daughter was 8 months old when her father had a heart attack aged 28 on our sofa while I put her to bed. He died instantly. I moved cities and my mother disowned me, so did my brother and my grandparents. I have nobody. ampx200B I ended up in a string of very abusive relationships, got engaged to a man who left me no choice... All the while, I was talking about all of this with my best friend. He was so supportive, so wonderful... I was going to move to the US again, coerced and manipulated into it but I had to meet my best friend first, as it was our one and only chance of meeting in person. So I flew over to Norway to be with him and hang out for 3 days. Nothing happened. Nothing at all... but it was obvious we both wanted it to. He gave me the strength to leave my abusive fiance Who by this point had sent death threats and abusive messages to said best friend and all my other friends, threatened to kill himself and his 3 year old daughter if I didnt move over there. I became a target for abuse from his family after we split up.",
    "What to expect when you share your mental health with your family? I recently shared some parts of my mental health with my family. So my question is this what should I expect them to behave after sharing this with them? My experience telling them wasnt pleasant and I dont know if Im at fault for sharing or if Im at fault for expecting a certain behavior. ampx200B Heres what happened I am 24, female. Ive had depression, anxiety, dissociation and derealisation for over 2 years now, probably had it before but it was only confirmed by a therapist two years ago because thats when I went to see whats wrong with me. ampx200B Nobody knows about this side of me but my ex girlfriend. So recently I told my mom I have anxiety. My family keeps showing at my house randomly to visit and stay for hours and that would cause panic attacks each time because I want expecting their visit or planned for it. So one day I burst and told my mom why Im always upset when they show up like that. all I expect is a call before hand to prepare myself mentally. ampx200B Ive told them about my dissociation and derealisation because they have been nagging for months wanting me to buy a car and drive instead of commuting and refusing to move to a house thats far from work. my mom lives with me so me driving is important to take her places I kept telling them Im not ready and I just need more practice. I took so many lessons and wasted over 1500 learning with no result to the extent I was kicked out of the driving lesson by my instructor because he thought my driving was dangerous So one day they said Im a coward and that I should just go and drive and not let my fear control me. So I shared the reason why I cant drive. They first said theres no such thing as what I mentioned and that I shouldnt diagnose myself with no knowledge. I told them I went to 3 therapist and they all confirmed this. After a moment of silence they said I shouldnt let this stop me from driving. I said no It should stop me because its a danger to my self and the people around me. My sister said ok seek help.",
    "I’m terrified of thinking I’m giving up, but also I feel like I’m done. Im turning 30 next year and Im the biggest fuck up I know. Ive been all my life thinking I had a great future ahead as I was a betterthanaverage student, my parents let me choose the career I wanted even if it was an economic riskIm majoring in arts, went through college very competently, got good grades but I also was inadvertently sabotaging myself. Ive been suffering from depression and anxiety since I was a teenager, my parents were told I might have a mental disorder such as an anxiety disorder or BPD. I went to a psychiatrist for a whole year but dropped out since I wasnt feeling any different and decided to instead focus on school. But being honest I never truly made an effort in school. Many professors told me I was talented but I was always so afraid to prove them wrong so I did no major projects. I kept avoiding major job opportunities since I thought those werent for me and I wasnt the right guy for them. My professional life had a shine of light at the beginning of 2020 as one of my projects was being financed, then the pandemic hit putting everything on hiatus, got no job of course, and had to go back to my parents. One year later everythings worse. Still jobless, still with my parents, procrastinating, hitting bottom every couple months, with 3 suicide attempts already, and just shitty thoughts every passing hour. My parents are sick of me even if they dont say it out loud. Im sick of myself. Im a fucking parasite too scared to do anything to change that. To move back to my apartment and find a job. To see how accomplished my friends are and seeing what theyve done in the past year and me thinking good for you mate, I just tried killing myself more than once haha. Im too ashamed. Im too old now. I see people being successful at 24 and Im 29 now and its too fucking late, still living off my parents is so humiliating. I cant shake away that feeling and Im so afraid one of these days that feeling turns unbearable and just end me without thinking it twice. Im done.",
    "I'm living in a shitty family situation and I don't know what to do Okay so Im 19 years old, graduated high school and got a few undiagnosed mental health issues. I struggle to go to a therapist. My parents are practically forcing me to get a job or an internship or anything at all. I dont feel well enough to do any of that. I literally cant bring myself to get regular house chores done because Im depressed as shit. I feel like running away from home but I dont think there is anywhere to go for me because Im technically an adult and nobody cares. Besides it would put lots of extra pressure on me if I had to care for my own apartment and stuff like that. I feel like Im at an all time low and suicide is also a thought Ive been playing with for a while.",
    "I've been depressed a long time and I'm really struggling right now I think Ive had depression for my whole life or at least early in my life, I was on the path toward depression. Now Im an adult and I feel like Im only getting worse as time goes on. Each time I get low Im going lower and its lasting longer. At about the end of the lockdown in my area, I had a breakdown. I had a panic attack that lasted for far too long and then for weeks afterward I would have them multiple times a day and for hours. Its not as bad as that anymore but the anxiety has been worse since then. I dont know how to describe the severity of my problem. Examples I guess could be I quit my job five months ago in large part for my mental health but also a myriad of other reasons of course and have not returned to work since. I had an injury that will likely require surgery and Ive been avoiding the doctor for going on seven months now and Its getting worse as a result. I also spend most of my days doing mostly nothing but find distractions from doing anything meaningful and have consistently failed to break that pattern. I want to live my life and I dont know if Im qualified to handle this on my own anymore but I dont know what to do. I dont want antidepressants and things like that. The thing is, I know what the things are that help me. Having a schedule and sticking to it, not smoking weed and fasting. Like, I remember what it was like when I was feeling better than I am now. Im just struggling to not keep falling. I feel like Im beginning to ramble so before this becomes a rant, can someone offer me some advice?",

Im in grad school online, and honestly it just repulses me and I want to drop out but I dont want to do bedside nursing anymore the pandemic shows you just how important you are to the world and what they think of your safety. I have no energy. The only thing that feels good is being warm in bed. I would never leave my bed if I had a choice. I stopped socializing and used the pandemic as an excuse. I have no interest or energy for my previous hobbies I loved hiking, painting, reading, writing. I am a literal shell just making motions through the days. How do you guys get any energy. How do you want things again. I feel like I am sleeping my life away. Im on lexapro and it helps anxiety. I have prn Valium for breakthrough panicanxiety. How do I get past myself and get some motivation and energy to do or be anything other than this.",

    "Can i get my life in order? I need help Hi this is first time i m doing this. I just wanted to start somewhere but i m not sure where. I am 30 years old now and i have problems with my life for a long time. I havent graduated from university, i m a student for almost 11 years i just have 3 more classes to graduate but most of the times i cant find the energy to study due to long time depression. For a liltle background i can say that i have been bullied a lot in high school and it left emotional scars on me. Before my current problem with school i had no problem with classes and other studies, like i could easily understand the problem and start on solutions. But now i get scared even to open up my notes to study. I am constantly in fear that i wasted my life and i will never be successful in life. I have no work talent especially in my work field, even though i did some job now and then. I have no idea if i can recover from my mistakes. If i can graduate i ll become electronics engineer but i have no idea what field i can work nor where to start. I learned a bit russian out of curiosity but it was so long ago.

    "just need to tell someone this Im 17. Today is my Dads 70th birthday. That might be surprising to some people because thats pretty old to have a 17 year old son. Peers have made fun of me and said im probably mentally retarded since my Dad had me when he was so old. This isnt what the topic is though and it doesnt even bother me. What does bother me is that my Dads 70th birthday is just a reminder to me that I dont have much time left with him. At most another 10 years and thats optimistic. It just makes me so fucking sad beyond words to even think about. My Dad is my favorite person in the world and I can not even comprehend living a single day without him. I just wish so bad that I could be like every other fucking person and have a young Dad so I could have some more time with him. I truly dont know what Ill do when he passes. With how old he is, it feels like theres really no way of knowing, when. It makes me sick to even think about it. but the hard reality is is that he could really die this year even. Or he could miraculously live until 100. But deep down I know that I have less than 10 years with him and it FUCKING KILLS ME. anyways if you took the time to read this poorly written rant, thank you",
    "puberty? attention? depression? everytime i think to myself that i might have depression, it just hits me that this is just puberty, im just seeking attention and whatnot, i feel really unhappy, i started wanting to eat less, wary of my weight i am very selfconscious and I cant sleep without using my phone to sleep, i feel like im such a failure to my parents who are trying to raise me with their best, i always tried my best to be a good child to them, not doing what they didnt want, but i felt like i suddenly changed, i didnt want to be a good kid anymore, following all the rules and having to hide whats not good within me, i just wanted to be who i am without trying to hide it from them like its such a crime, but I cant because im too afraid, i want to be honest with them and relieve this feeling off my chest but I cant, i always think theyll probably think that im just wanting attention, I dont want to be ashamed, i dont like the feeling of embarrassment, i just want to be alone, away from everything but i want to talk at the same time, its just that i always rethink it, when i think of talking with someone, my mind just rethinks everything and i eventually end up not talking with someone, so i wanted to talk here, with more responsible people than me I could also be probably just too self conscious, I dont know, im doubting myself with everything i think which could be the reason, making me not come up with an answer, Ive also been feeling empty for a very long time, i could laugh and be happy at times but it doesnt feel right, like theres something missing, i dont have any traumas that i can remember to be a source, im an introvert who dislikes social interaction and is comfortable isolated, i have thanatophobia which I dont remember having a trauma of either but i suddenly get panic attacks as if im being choked and my brain just goes blank, which i havent told my parents about either but i had a panic attack before in front of them which probably just seemed like i was just feeling unwell or something to them i think, i only remember it vaguely which is why i dont really remember what happened but I do remember them being passive about it ?, considering everything was completely normal and i dont remember them asking me why i acted like that, and right now as im typing, i feel like im making my parents look shitty even if theyre not and i know they dont deserve it and im just rambling stupidly like this but i felt like i just had to open up everything i hadnt told them since i developed bottling up my feelings instead of talking im probably better gone, but i dont want to leave my parents am i depressed or just over reacting? or attentionseeking?",

But deep down I always knew I only made all these changes and sought help just so I could tick them off and in my suicide letter write look, I tried all these things and they didnt work so I killed myself instead. Oh, and did I mention that Ive only told my gf and my older sister about, and even that took YEARS this since I feel so embarrased and dont want people to get involved. I read about people all the time saying just muster through, its worth it in the end, or therapy saved my life, or I know it feels dark right now.... But I just cant connect with or believe in that. And I know I sound like an immature spoiled brat in saying so. How does one find the motivation or the will to fight this? I feel like giving up before actually starting the fight. It wont be worth it. I really cant see myself feeling proud, happy or satisfied about myself, or being the person I want to be. I really cant put words to my thoughts and feelings, it all sounds so banal. I know a lot of people feel like this, like no one understands me, it will not work for me, there is no help I can get . I KNOW there is help I can get, although it hasnt for me yet. I KNOW it might get better if I put the time and effort into it. I just dont want to. I want to die.

I got better at first but it keeps going downhill, Im not improving at all. My dreams and motivation to live is slowly fading away, but I dont want to hurt anyone anymore. I dont want to sit through this, I want it to end so badly. Ive met a therapist and it didnt help much. Im not entirely sure if medication even helped me. My friends are here for me but I hate to bother them so much, I feel guilty for taking up their time. I want to end it here, it feels like its never gonna improve.",
    "Need to hear that everything is fine, please ? Im in a good path, i see a therapist, take meds, try my best all the time, try to provide support here when i can, but damn, it is so fragile. My emotionnal state is so fragile. I have some big project, i try to handle everything my best, but when a little thing does not work, i feel like falling underwater, cannot breathe, immediate tears, and feel like a failure. I try so hard, soooo hard to hold everything, and the slightest disappointement breaks me up. Every time. Again and again. I know everything is fine, and will be fine, i have a good situation, ive overcome many things but still... Made a mistake yesterday, borrowed my moms car, filled it with the wrong type of gas, had to call the insurance and everything, it is in repair, and i feel like a huge pile of shit. I told my mom and i could feel the disappointement. She always act like a spoiled brat when it comes to lend something and i messed up one of her cars. Tomorrow is my birthday and i have nothing. Not a family gathering, nothing. I feel left behind. I... just want some support, just someone who tell me its okay, please",
    "Loneliness is exhausting Hello everyone. Ive been dealing with depression for years now. My whole life Ive had a goofy personality, I feel as though it gravitated people towards me, but all for the wrong reasons. When life got real I felt like no one took me seriously. Ive been carrying trauma my whole life and its been affecting me. Im at a point in my life now where my friends barely even talk to me anymore. I have to basically pull teeth just to get them to hang outI hate to be negative but I really feel like life sucks rn. I just want friends and family that support me and check up on me. I can deal with everything else on my own with my therapist. But no one seems to talk to me about anything unless Im doing something wrong. Everyone knows what Ive been going through, even the attempt I had before. But it just seems like life goes on, I feel invisible. Like I said I really just want friends thatll get me out the house to go fishing or go on a hike and make me feel like I actually mean something to someoneI dont know what to do anymore."
