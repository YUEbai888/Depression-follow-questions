    "Kind of an Emergency, at the very least I need some info hopefully from others who've had it happen. So Ive been taking Wellbutrin and affexor I think theyre both called for about a year now. Theyve helped alright, but Ive heard that if you just stop them you can get sick. Thats what the nurse at my therapymedication office said to my therapist anyway. I have one last dose tomorrow and I dont have money to buy more even if the jackass nurse that I talked to today can figure out how to send the prescription out. What am I in for? Im not sure when Ill be able to take them again but Im a little nervous to be honest and I dont want to get over anxious about it and make it worse.",
    "Family crises Im 31. 9 years ago I met my wife in my small hometown in East Tennessee. I fell in love with her, but she was from Midwest Florida, and had a 3 year old son already. Soon after we met she got pregnant with my son. Growing up with a father that lived in Illinois, I knew immediately that I would do anything to be there for my unborn child. So, we decided to move to her home town in Florida where all of her family is, get married and start raising her first born and our new baby. Ive always had depression to some degree. Weve had a rough marriage almost from the start. So, weve slowly been drifting apart this whole time. On March 28th we started the day off with sex. I felt like a million bucks. As the day went on she said she was tired of being couped up in the house all week because of the Corona virus. She wanted to go to a hotel to get away I supported her decision to take some time for her self and told her she should go. Eventually she decided to not go to the hotel and instead go out with one of her girlfriends and her sister. I once again supported her decision. She left at 2pm. As I was at home with our boys playing in the pool making burgers for them and having fun I realized shed been gone for almost 6 hours. I started calling her and she wouldnt pick up, so I Facebook messaged her friend she said she was with, and asked her to have her give me a call. Her friend was surprised to say the least that I was contacting her, mainly because she wasnt with her. She finally called me around 830 after her friend contacted her to see what was going on. Caught in her lie, she immediately confessed that she had driven an hour and a half to go out on a 37 year old rich guys boat for a while. After their boat ride, they went to go get Publix subs in his 2020 Corvette. My wife works at a successful car lot, and this was one of her customers. she actually sold him the boat and the Corvette. He knows that shes married with kids. She swears they didnt do anything sexual.",
    "I am lost after pretending to be badass for 2 years Hello, I am college student and my life isnt best if I can say that, I was bullied at elementary school, my parents was alcoholics, from my 13 years I have a problem with drugs and alcohol, at year 2018 I had a pretty good relationship but I was pretty melancholic and she left me, so I had half year depression full of crying, wanting to kill myself and drinking booze and eating pills, after that one day I was magically blessed or so and I dont had depression anymore, I was new me, but as I am older I realise I was just hiding my emotions and now it just spiked to the point I am literally lost, I dont have much friends I am crying I dont have a energy for my school tasks, I am working at Mcdonald which is hard and I dont have time for nothing, I think I am ugly, my teeth are broken and I am at a point I dont know if I can help myself, everything I want is someone to talk to and hug when I am broken so I can fix myself, but I struggle with making new friends because everyone thinks I am junkie badass without emotions, I dont really know why I am posting this here, maybe I am hoping for a miracle? I dont know, but if you have some opinion or something I would like to hear that. Sorry for my English and if you are struggling, know that you are not alone, hope everyone gets better, love u all.",
    "I feel fed up please listen to me? Hi, Since a young age I had a big need to be in showbiz. I was part of the chorus in school and did some plays. People thought I was good. Sadly it went nowhere like I had no family with connections. I made this friend who was a child actor but he had the looks and I lacked that department. Years later, I am living in the USA struggling the same thing and being older. I love to act. I really do. I try a lot but I cant do an American accent and people dismiss me or even make fun of me. I keep trying to reach out to people to make projects and I get ghosted. I moved to a big city to get opportunity and it is so competitive with crappy entry level jobs. I have done so many labor gigs to be able to survive, worked 24 hours straight and 0 acting opportunity. I have a job that gives me little freedom working 6 hours for 6 days a week and even there upper management writes me up for petty things when I work so hard and can lose that job anytime. I dont like anything else other than acting and it is me, all alone. I have a few friends but they deal with their own issues like alcoholism and such. I see people on my social media or my friends friends who get acting opportunities in indie films and such and they do things that I could and makes me wonder... Why they dont cast me for anything? What is wrong with me? I have been to acting classes and I have barely gotten any feedback. I hear things like my accent or before Ive heard I was chubby and ugly and I fixed it since I am fit now and put some fillers. It is just I feel nobody values me... It is easy to think so since my very own parents abandoned me and wanted no responsibility. Any comfort would help please.",
    "I have no idea how to improve my life Hi, so Im very embarassed to be writing this and fair warning this might get long, but here it goes Im a woman in my late twenties and I basically feel like Ive wasted my life. I used to have many ailments growing up, which has led to me being coddled and protected by my mom. I feel like I got stuck somewhere in my development and it really hurts to see people mych younger being much more mature and successful than me. Ive tried studying different things, but I feel like none of them were ever really my thing. Id like to be an artist, but my shitty selfesteem is really preventing me from sharing anything with the world. I want to find lovewhich is actually my most important goal at the moment, but I have no clue how to find someone, especially with my depression and anxiety. I feel unloveable. Tinder seems like its just designed to make you doubt yourselfIm not a looker. So yeah, I just dont know. The worst part is I know its my fault, but I feel like Im helpless and have zero control over anything. I dont feel like my therapist understands my needs either. I need serious help, because I feel very hopeless.",
    "Can't express emotions. As a kid I used to be very talkative and normal I guess. As I grew up I just got very emotionally closed off. Like I have this terrible habit of bottling everything in and not even showing expressions. This lack of emotional display really damaged me. It makes me look so unapprochable and boring. I am about to graduate so we do things like mock interviews, and this lack of expressionemotions had been pointed out by my teachers too. Help me how to overcome this and act like a human and not a zombie.",
    "I feel like I have no reason to be alive after I saw a movie I was looking forward to. Ok I know it sounds dumb but I only get through life because I have things to look forward to, usually Im looking forward to movies or TV shows. Today I saw a movie that I was really looking forward to for a while, I loved the movie but afterwards I felt like I had nothing else to push me through life. I try to look forward to other stuff but I dont really feel that excited for the stuff coming out.",

Today was litterbox day and I change my geckos water and check his temperatures every day, usually. I didnt do anything for my gecko or clean the litterbox. Sometimes I forget to feed my cat and give her fresh water for a few hours too. Am I a terrible person? I cant give them away, theres nowhere really for them to go. Theyre the only reason Im still alive and I cant even do the bare minimum for them. Im going to bed so if I get responses I wont reply till morning. Sorry.",
    "Trying to help my bf with his depression after failed attempts. Im an enlisted soilder. My boyfriend is a vet. He has not held a job for more than a few weeks. Ive applied for jobs for him, gotten him 2 jobs, paid for his motorcycle repair, notarized his divorce paperwork etc. The list goes on and on. Weve been together for a 1.5 years. Lived together for 1. He doesnt tell me he loves me anymore, doesnt call me anything other than hey or my first name, cant make plans more than a week in advance. His mother, our mutual friend and I have been taking care of him. He doesnt go out with friends or try to go back school. Nor does his physical therapy even though its free. Hes actively not trying to do anything other than exist. Is it okay to just walk away at this point? As a soilder, Im conflicted and feel like I cant leave a fallen soldier. As gf Im exhausted and angry. Any advice? Im not looking for permission to stay in this relationship. I really want to leave but with a clear conscience.",
    "Am I depressed? This past week I F16 have been feeling really down. Its been on and off for the past 7 months after I broke up with my girlfriend, but the lows only lasted two, three days tops. Im not trying to self diagnose but Im worried I might be developing something. Im not proud of it but Ive been drinking as well, everyday for a little over a week. I have support, my friends know all of this and offer to help and talk to me but it just makes me uncomfortable and like Im a nuisance. We make packs to stop drinking but I always end up breaking them. Ive been missing school too, I cant find myself to get up and socialize with people. Is there a way to find out, rather than just talking to a therapist? I dont want to get worked up about nothing but I seriously feel awful. Thanks in advance.",

As much as I want to address my issues NOW Im impatient, going straight to medication just didnt feel right... ampx200B I could go on a rant about just how difficult it has been for someone with no prior experience trying to deal with this new situation in American Healthcare, but I wont.

    "I'm getting angry at my depression. I want to break out of it and I can't seem to shake it. I wasnt able to complete homework because of mental fog and everytime I opened my online class dashboard I would break down and cry until I fell asleep. I did a few assignments and it would take me half the day to write a 2 page paper. Took me a week to write a 6 page paper. I used to be able to do them in a few hours. I feel like my mind is deteriorating. Conversation is more difficult. I can easily explain my feelings because its a trait of my personality, but casual talk and reading people has become impossible. Im getting anxious because talking to people I already know is starting to feel like talking to strangers. Ive been crying my eyes out over small insecurities I used to be over and accept. Im trying to figure out how to reorganize my life but its so hard. I know people who go out and party and drink night after night and still go to college and go to work and are doing great. They are happy and healthy and only have a small nagging guilt about not getting more done. I feel like I produce NOTHING of value to the world and its so difficult to just chip away at learning a song or doing a simple assignment or task at work. All I can listen to is super depressing music as well if I want to enjoy it. I feel like a emo highschooler. My whole life Ive struggled with motivation, my parents called me a lazy piece of shit everyday and its true. Everything takes so much mental effort for me and I can barely focus because my mind goes a million miles an hour with intense imagery and nonsensical logic. To slow it down and focus on the world around me, especially the physical world, is a manual effort. The depression just makes it all the worse. I just want to know if anyone might relate and how they may have improved their lives? Ive been feeling so isolated even though I surround myself with people lately, and there are less and less reasons I want to stay around.",
    "My parents think I am the issue My mom does another shit thing. If i report to her what i did she victimises herself despite the fact she wasnt there, and what i say is simply my fault, because i need to shut up and execute. Pretty much my entire life they did this. I feel scared, i have anxiety towards them, if i wont do something they will share with me their mean thoughts about me. I cannot live like this.... I am in pain.",
    "A bit of a strange case: Exercise has DESTROYED my mental health. Thoughts? Advice? First, some basic health data about myself Age16 SexMale Height 510 WeightAround 142145 pounds Ever since the summer of 2019, exercise has been a huge part of my life. My main fitness goal was gaining muscle, so I was doing strength training with weights around three to four times a week. But I also wanted to be able to eat a lot of food and generally have a relaxed diet at the same time. A big reason for that was because my sister had recently recovered from severe anorexia, so my father thought that it would be wise for me to not trigger her and potentially provoke a relapse by following a restrictive dietby restrictive I mean eliminating junk food, soft drinks, etc. Because of this, I started doing a lot of cardio, and I really mean a lot. I started out with around 30 minutes of running every other day, but I gradually added more cardio over time. My peak was during the summer of 2020, when I was doing around 2 and a half hours of cardio every other day, in addition to 10 minutes of HIIT on my strength training days. When school started, I cut the duration down to the following routine alternating between 1 hour of strength training plus 35 minutes of cardio and 95 minutes of cardio every other day. Then, in January 2021, I got a severe knee injury from doing calf raises. Little did I know the day that I injured myself that, from that point on I would descend into the darkest, most hellish part of my 16 years on this Earth. You have to understand that Id made exercise an essential part of my life. If I didnt complete my exercise, I would fall into a pretty bad mood, sometimes for the rest of the day. So when I injured my knee, I was extremely disappointed. Every form of cardio which Id been doing and enjoyedbiking and running was off the table. Judging from prior experience, swimming was also not an option, because I found itand still do super boring and torturous. My last cardio option was the rowing machine. I replaced my bikingrunning with rowing. The problem was that I HATED rowing, even. more than I hated swimming.",
    "Discord is awful, and I'm crying. When I ask to join a server with all my old friends who disliked me, I get a blatant fuck no from probably all the moderators. Everyone there is my friend, and I just want to feel happy again when being with my old friends. I know I hurt my friends emotionally, but Ive changed and Im doing better. But... They just wont move on, and them not moving on lead me to doing bad things to myself cutting, hurting myself, contemplating suicide. My life doesnt feel the same anymore. Discord is my only source of friends, I have no friends IRL, so I look forward to seeing other people. But people decide to be toxic... And just wont leave me alone when Im trying to move on. Yes, Ive gotten a few disabilities from trauma. Alexithymia, higher emotional sensitivity, voices in my head, anxiety. It sucks. I wish it would go away. I wish I had friends. Real ones I could hug and kiss. So I can be happy. My current new friends on Discord think Im a snowflake because of how sensitive I am, but I always try to explain what Ive been through and why I act certain ways. If you want to know about my person i.e age, hobby, personality. Just ask me under my comment.",

Like not super terrible life ending decisions, but decisions that I know will make me miserable later, namely starting a habit of not eating and making a character that I really dont want to play because I didnt want to say no DnD is a big thing that I love in life and it also kinda tortures me because Im in a big group, and groups of people were actually a huge part of my trauma. My new character starts tomorrow and itll almost definitely make DnD as bad as school is, but I keep telling myself I deserve the pain Im going to feel and I really hope the pain I cause myself will push me to suicide real suicide not just chickening out at the last minute.

    "I need help I dont know how much longer I can actually take living in this cruel world. Im constantly made fun of because I am ugly. All of my few friends have abandoned me for no reason. The only friend I had told me that I would never get a girlfriend. The fact of him telling me I wasnt going to get a girlfriend didnt bother me that much but that he was saying it in a serious voice and not a joking way. My dad just exploits me for money even though he makes over 100k a year. Every time I talk to him he just reminds me that I owe him for the car that he bought me for 1500 so I could get to work. Im only 17 btw. I just dont know what to do. Ive quit going to lunch at school because I dont have anybody to sit with. Ive somewhat stopped talking to my dad. Im just in a really bad place.",
    "We were engaged. He left me for a 19 year old he has been talking to online for the past 3 months They only saw each other in person once at the time, had each other added on Snapchat ever since, but never talked. When the Tokyo Olympics finally started, she posted a story on Snapchat about Brazil losing in a game of volleyball or something, thats what he told me at least. Since him and I always watched the games together when we could, he knew about it and replied to her story making a joke. Theyve been talking ever since. He told her about me and our story, that we were engaged, etc, and she thought it was awesome and asked to follow me on Instagram. I accepted it. She was extremely nice to me in the beginning and also replied extremely fast. After a few days talking on there she asked me for my WhatsApp number. Ill confess that I didnt really want to give her because I barely knew her and I dont like giving my number to random people. But I didnt want to be rude so I ended up giving her my number and we started talking there. After just a little while talking on WhatsApp, she asked me if we wanted to do a video call with her us 3. I thought she was moving way too fast with intimacy with us, but I asked my fiancé if he wanted to and he said it was up to me. I ended up accepting it. It was actually nice and we called once or twice more. Well, so this situation of her being friends with us lasted for about a month, but around the beginning of October I started being suspicious about some things with the two. We used to call every night before I slept Im at GMT3 and hes at GMT5, and he started giving excuses to go to sleep earlier because he was feeling sick, tired, etc, and I believed him. Well, all those times he was ending our call earlier to call her for 3 hours straight. They also called at other times during the day that I never knew about.",

    "I’m starting to have a harder time functioning Hey, Im a 19 yo male 20 on Easter. Thought that would be a fun thing to throw in and Ive been living with depression since I was 9 or 10. Its just progressed as Ive gone on. Ive always been an extremely self loathing person and the negative thoughts just come up more frequently. It just happens out of nowhere. Doesnt matter what Im doing, itll just sucker punch me. My mood gets really dark at the snap of a finger. But now its getting harder to actually cope with it and function as a human being. I think its been this way for about a year now. I used to be able to escape it if I was doing something active. Like with friends or whatever. But now it doesnt matter. Itll just fuck me up whenever. Sometimes it can get to the point where Ill have difficulty remembering things or having a conversation, I dont know how to formulate sentences, and it just becomes allconsuming. I dont understand it. My thoughts in this state range from craving substances to escape, thoughts about how nobody likes me and I dont matter to anyone, and sometimes thoughts that I need to hang myself. I want to have a good life but I dont want to live it as me. Im way too hard on myself. I know I have a charismatic personality that some people enjoy, and I can acknowledge some of my strengths when Im more level headed, but more and more I just regress to what I described earlier where my mind just tries to take me down.",

    "The Effects of Depression on a Relationship [ADVICE] I am in relationship with someone who has major depression. When it gets really bad for him, it gets bad for us. He can be a little mean, irritable. These times feel the loneliest for me. I cant help but feel sad as a consequence at times. I understand that in these moments he isnt himself nonetheless it still hurts. I am generally busy and there is distance between us. I feel guilty at times I cant do more and feel like I am being pulled everywhere in my life in general. I feel numb and sadness which I try like hell to ignore in myself to preclude any ideas of seeing a breakup as a resolution to how I am feeling. I do love him, his pain is my pain. There is a certain emotional fortification developed when you are in these types of relationships perhaps that is why I feel like I am not allowed to crumble, need or want especially when it gets really bad. Is there any better way to deal with this? with us? my loneliness? How can you be happy in life when your partner isnt? How do you share a life when your partner doesnt have the energy at times to pick the phone or talk to you?",

    "I’m 15 and don’t want to live with my dad anymore. My parents have been divorced for 7 years and I go to my moms house weekdays, my dads weekends. The main issue I have with my dad is that I simply cant trust him. I cant open up to him without him rejecting my opinion. Growing up with him has made me feel helpless, and living with him feels like giving him all the control. He has threatened to take my phone because I said I value emotional relationships more than comfortable living. He threatened to go to court and call the police if I refused to go to his house. I said I wouldnt mind going for dinner and such, but he outright rejects my opinions. He said it wasnt my choice, and that just proves my point where I cant trust him to respect my feelings. He knows I have depression. He says hes willing to change, but I dont have the mental capacity to live with him if he doesnt change by himself. I live in BC Canada, so the age requirement for choosing who to live with is 19, but I researched about it and it said that the court will mostly decide for the childs best interest. Im terrified of the slightest possibility that my dad will win custody. At that point, I might as well kill myself. My dad is a negative influence, a toxic personality. I cut out most toxicity from my life because its caused me to be depressed, and its why I dont want to see him again. Im trying to compromise but I cant live with him. I just feel upset and terrified right now.",

I am a 20 year old male currently in University studying what I like. Physically, I consider myself to be average, but sometimes I hate what I see in the mirror and sometimes I like what I see in it. Mirrors are a source of unhappiness for me and even if I try to escape my homes mirrors I will often open the camera app of my phone to look at me and take pictures of my face because I dont feel comfortable with what I see. I have hundreds of selfies just to look and to analyze my face and I always get angry if I dont like what I see. I dont know how much the last thing is related to the following thing, but I am a very timid, shy and silent person however I never have a frown in my face in public because I am always open to talk to anyone because I really need someone to talk to me I thank and appreciate virtual messages and conversations but I need a real life interaction. I feel guilty because sometimes I transmit this feeling of helplessness, sadness and misery to my dad and my brother and I know my dad thinks theres something wrong with me and I know he is shy to talk to me about it. I am in misery right now, the last real person who isnt from my family who I talked with was last September and I still cant consider him my friend because I know how real and genuine friendships feel like judging from my childhood good friendships, I miss those friendships but those persons are now far away, now have a life of their own with girlfriends and friends. I try to contact my first and old friends in Facebook and although they enthusiastically answer we can never get together, and even if we could I would be so embarassed to share with them what my life has become.",
    "Are anti-depressants worth taking? I 25m have been unemployed since finishing my MA for over a year now. Are antidepressants worth taking? My doctor offered them and I think Im going to look into a new therapist. I think I might have some sort of ADHD or anxiety instead but Im not too sure.

    "I'm really depressed and gonnad kill myself because reddit welcome sucks and that you have no help when you begin. the only thing you can try is to post something in a channel that will be automatically removed because you doesnt have enough reputation or karma stuff I dont know . then you end up with the chat room full of bot explaining you that if you are depressed and that you wnat to kill yourself you can post on this channel. Thats what Im doing",
    "I'm getting angry at my depression. I want to break out of it and I can't seem to shake it. There are tons of various things that have contributed to my mental state at this age. Abusive parents with narcissistic personality disorder, running around with bad friends, I was molested sort of, and publicly, starting drugs in middle school and becoming addicted by highschool, heavy psychedelic use, and whatever quirky autistic spectrum disorder or attention disorder caused school to be so overwhelming for me growing up. I want to feel better, thats for sure. But I look at normal functioning and it doesnt match my ideal for what a human life should be. Ive looked down on normalcy for a long time because it leads to brainwashed nonindividuals, not questioning yourself, and honestly I think it limits our evolution. I dont like where the world is going and it alienates me in addition to my mental state. These past couple of months I have reverted to terrible behaviors and failed a lot. I failed one of my college courses I had a 3.7 gpa prior, Ive been blowing up at work and unable to get my work done properly, on my days off I either lay in bed all day or smoke a bunch of weed and drink and party with friends I cant have fun without substances and havent even since I quit hard drugs like opiates and benzos 4 years ago, I tell myself to get it together and I just dont have the willpower because Im not happy about my opportunities in life. Im going to school to become a teacher, before this I had a 2 year existential crisis where I didnt want to do ANYTHING and I would become psychotic and suicidal, I just hated everything in life and I felt like I had tasted multiple ways of living and none of them resonated with me. Now I feel like this again. My routine was interrupted by covid19 and even though I was still a mild nicotine addict and had a mental breakdown during every homework assignment, I would push myself. Now I feel like Ive backslid and Im right where I was 2 years ago. I wasnt able to complete homework because of mental fog and everytime I opened my online class dashboard I would break down and cry until I fell asleep.",

    "My girlfriend is suffering from depression, and I’m looking for some advice on how I can be more supportive. For some context, weve been together for almost three years and a large portion of our relationship has been long distance. Shes been suffering from depression for most of her adult life and its been especially bad in recent weeks. Shes a recent college grad and is really stressed out about her future, and whether or not shes making correct decisions for her career. This causes her to feel anxiety, which in turn causes her depression to worsen and this cycle repeats. I know that I cant cure her depression, but I want to do all I can to be supportive while she figures out how best to deal with it. Recently shes been saying she doesnt feel like its fair for me to have to deal with her when shes like this, and shes worried thats its having a negative impact on our relationship. Ive never really had to deal with depression as closely as I am now, and am looking for ways to improve, or even just some advice on things to do to help. I always try to be supportive, letting her know that Im here for her and that I love her. Its been increasingly difficult for me as she often becomes withdrawn, and with the distance and our differing work schedules most of our communication is through texting. Sorry if this post has been a little lengthy, I havent had the chance to talk to anyone other than her about it. I appreciate any advice you guys can share.",
    "Feeling at the end of the line When we got together we swore to work hard so we can give our selfs and our families a better life than the one we knew. As I mentioned I have anger issues and while I was working one day my boss called me to his office just to yell at me about a complain I presented to management about an issue with my laptop, I used to use my personal laptop to work in the office because they couldnt provide one for me and when it broke I asked them for a replacement, apparently this was out of line for them and he just begun insulting me with my colleagues hearing everything in the next room, I almost lost it but kept it together just enough to put myself face to face with him and asking him to repeat everything closing my fist ready to beat the shit out of him, he just stayed silent and I laughed at him and just turned away, a few weeks later I was fired if you think I should have reported him and the company I did but keep in mind this is Bolivia, there is no justice for anyone who doesnt have money so until today I havent been able to get another stable job and we basically just live with the food our families give us and small jobs I got and everything goes to pay the bills, on top of this, about a year and a half into our relationship when we moved in together and a month before getting fired we got a loan from the bank to began a business together and when she was set to go and make a deposit to buy our merchandise her uncle got notice of this and robbed her like a common thief yeah you read that right, so we went into debt with no job and no business, police and family where notified but the scumbag flew the country to Peru as far a we know.",
    "I'm a failure I felt Ill and nauseous for 2 weeks,I was hoping to passed away in my sleep but I only felt tired and no appetite. Second worst one is either drinking 6 litre of water in an hour or drinking a quarter of hair tonic bottle, I could go on because I vommited and it burned my throat. So on so forth I have no interest in studying anymore, Im not good at that. Everyone been pressuring me to get an A even though I cant get a C. My family doesnt have much money and is very strict, my father doesnt allow me to work, study first. I know that I will work a minimum wage job and I know he cares about me The only upside about me is that I like to try things and get the experience, I tried many things from coding, stock, drop shipping, making my own face cream, cooking, farming, exercise etc. Im more interested in those type of things than studying but I know none of those things matter if I dont have any capital so to get capital I need a job or win lottery somehow. Also I like writing suicide notes  Im an idiot I know that, guy that cant even passed my highschool exam. Guy that doesnt learn from previous mistake. Ive been suicidal this year because everything is going downhill. I have just started stock trading recently with 800 dollar and I have lost 500 dollar already. Last month I was able to make atleast 20dollar perday for 2week for now I have been losing 20 dollar a day around that amount. My family having less money, my sister have college dept, I know that I wont passed my highschool now Im just waiting for the announcement of the result. I have never been this depressed before In my life, everything anything I do it doesnt seem to have any result anymore, dropship cant make a single money,, I dont have any motivation to code forgetting every thing about it, trading now left with 280 dollar. Knowing that I cant do anything and I have been a disappointment in my life, I think is better if Im not here I wont be able to accomplish anything I stopped exercise because Everytime I do, all the bad memories keep appearing out in my head.",

I live at home, but I pay bills and not working isnt an option. I have been depressed for two years and when I first quit my job to focus on school my parents got angry and hounded me everyday to get another job. I feel like I am less of a person because I cant juggle fulltime school and work, my coworkers brag about how much they work on top of school and it makes me feel like Im inadequate because I cant handle my 20 hours.

    "15 years on Antidepressants and thinking about Transcranial magnetic stimulation. Has anyone tried and has it worked? I have been on antidepressants for 15 years and through so many psychiatrists and therapists but very little has changed. I dont know what to do anymore all I think about is killing myself, but my mother already lost a child in a car accident and I cant do that to her she is such wonderful woman and the only thing keeping me here on earth. While shes still alive I continue seeking new ways to help my depression but I am running out of options. So I have been looking into Transcranial magnetic stimulation TMS.

    "No longer actively depressed but now I need help beating the apathy. I think my life has been changed forever by the major depressive episode I had last year. I dont think Ill ever feel quite like that again I hope, but its left me a parting gift. I just dont care about most things anymore. This is positive in some ways  it makes me less of a perfectionist for example good enough is fine and I dont get choked up on the little things as much. However, it is also very very negative in other ways. I will go for several weeks without doing my laundry, wait until the last second to do assignments, wont clean, etc. I have NO sense of urgency or shame, particularly urgency, but still have minor guilt after the fact if someone comments on my slobbishness. Like, if someone was coming over and I had an hour to clean I wouldnt get everything done. Id probably pick up a few things and say Im sorry for the mess and feel guilty afterwards that Im a slob. But it wouldnt make me change, however and that annoys me. I know that I do care that these things are happening, but theres a total disconnect from actually caring enough to do them respectably. For example, I would like to clean my room because I enjoy the look and space of a clean room. I know it makes me feel accomplished when I do. But a bigger part of my brain doesnt mind living in squalor because it is so apathetic to everything. I dont like this about myself. I want to be timely and disciplined but I have a hard time caring and almost 0 motivation though its slowly creeping back in occasionally. I feel this may be a discipline issue but I would also like some sense of motivation or ambition. I get like this with my career goals too. I want to want more for myself, but I dont act on it.",

I think I just dont want to take responsibility for my actions thats why I dont have confidence in myself. I wish I could make my decisions with confidence and not seek validation from any family and friend.",

I have a shitty attitude about everything and I constantly feel down and like Im missing something. I dont have any of what I consider REAL problems on the outside so people often wonder What is even her problem?!. It was more like I was lazy and finding myself and now at 31, my family is very concerned about me. Theyre all just as messed up, so it is even more humiliating for me that they are even worried. My major problem is I have no spine, I try way too hard to be liked, and I have lost touch with reality and what it means to engage with other people. After much reflection, I have no idea how to change. Im truly one of those toxic people in every sense of the word and I dont know how to change or be aware of myself. I have no friends, no kids, no one but my mom. Its so embarrassing, but I feel like a teenager still. Like I have no idea how to care for myself or be my own age.

    "I'm looking for advice on helping my depressed and, as I've just learned, suicidal grandma. So long story short, my grandma is an alcoholic, shes depressed, and shes revealed to me today that she wishes she was dead all the time. Shes tried for a long time these help herself, to get out of her addiction to alcohol and cigarettes, but she really cant do it herself. She fell today and has multiple times before after drinking heavily, and it took a while to get her back up due to her obesity. This was when she told me she wishes she was dead. I told her that she doesnt wish that and shes not thinking clearly because shes drunk, and she told me she feels the same way when shes sober. I know that to have suicidal thoughts, you arent thinking clearly by definition. I didnt explain that to her though. A lot of my family struggles with addiction and depression, and Id say my grandma is in a better state than most of them. Im curious what steps anyone here has taken in getting a family member the help they need. What resources are available to me and how do I help someone who is fortunate enough to at least want to help themselves? Thank you in advance.",
    "I am really struggling with people touching me Ive been having a pretty rough two or three months. This means even that I feel uncomfortable having my boyfriend touching me. I have talked to him about this twice how Ive been growing distant and disliking anything to do with touching he is a person who loves touch. It seems like even though Ive told him how bad it feels having someone touching me, he keeps doing it and it is starting to suffocate me. He is always asking why I dont touch him and stopping me to hug me or touch me in some way. This is making me quite irritable as well. I am waiting to get help from a doctor and see what I can do about it, but can you guys give me some advice on this? How can I get myself to not feel this way?

    "I feel like garbage, and I don't know what to do. This probably isnt that big of a problem, sorry for wasting your time if you read this. Hi, Im Viktor. Im 17, I live in the US, and I just feel kinda lost. I have a best friend thats my age. She lives overseas though. So our only method of communication is online messaging or calls. Recently, Ive been feeling really just kinda empty and bad. Ive been on break and its almost over and through it all, Ive struggled to feel happy. I have to fake all my smiles so that my family dont start worrying about me. Due to this feeling of emptiness, I would talk with my friend a lot about it. But I thought that I was being annoying, so I told her I wouldnt talk with her again until I feel better. Its been about 3 days. Which is a bit because we just about talk every day. Today Ive just been crying and havent been able to stop until a little over 30 minutes ago. It sucks, and it hurts, and I dont know what Im doing. I missed the deadline to apply to the college I wanted the final deadline, and I dont think theyll take my application late. I feel so tiny and helpless and awful, and I just needed to tell someone. Anyone. Sometimes I think people would just be better off without me around.",

    "Soon to be dad and I’m struggling to cope So Ive written posts about this before but heres the basics. My pregnant girlfriend split up with me. She said she dident love me anymore. I lost my temper and said some things I shouldnt have which I admit was my fault. We dident talk or have any contact for 6 weeks I drunk heavily during this time and my depression was unbearable. I eventually reached out and apologised and explained I wanted to be there for the baby. She agrees I meet her for the first time since we broke up and she makes it clear she never wants to get back together and just wants to be friends. So since then Ive cut right back on my drinking intact I dont drink anymore. As the son of a alcoholic looser father I dont want that for my child I want to be a good dad. Anyway every time I talk to her it feels like a kick in the teeth. So I actively avoid messaging her and only respond to her when she messages me cause of all the pain it brings up. The only thing keeping me going is the baby. But its been 10 weeks since we broke up and I still feel just as broken and miserable inside. I dont have any friends I sit on my PlayStation all day just trying to zone out and focus on something other than how miserable I am. I thought that when I stopped drinking I would feel better and to be honest I dont I still feel like shit. I have a therapist whos helpful and a support worker to help me not go back to drinking. But it doesnt help much and to be honest I just dont know what to do anymore.",
    "\"Paying for happiness\" - anyone else? It is as if my body and mind HAVE to revert back to a depressive norm, like a rubber band snapping back the higher I stray from it, the more intense the snapback. This is devastating, even as I have recognized the pattern and come to expect it. It literally feels like I am punished by my own bodymind for daring to experience happiness or joy. It feels like a cruel trick by the Universe every time, or like I have to pay the piper for not feeling depressed for one damn day. I have considered the possibility of bipolar disorder, but I really dont think thats it. Certainly yoyoing between joy and depression has that weird polarity, but the happiness is always caused by externals  a trip somewhere, quality time with friends, a great experience, etc. It doesnt just come out of nowhere. I really have to find and create the happiness. It is the punishment that has no rhyme or reason aside from following the pattern. It is inevitable even if nothing bad happens to bring me down  its just a crash, like a plane running out of fuel and dropping out of the sky. And while the happiness can feel euphoric sometimes, it doesnt feel like any kind of manic episode Ive heard or read about. It is more just the joy of feeling some goddamn unvarnished happiness for a little while. Does anyone else experience this? Any suggestions? !",
    "Life's weird. Life is a weird place. With all the bad stuff in it and with life making no sense. Im depressed. I feel like a bag in the wind and thats pretty much the jist of it. Its hard to be happy when you dont see it making sense to be happy. People dont understand a lot of the time and tell me to just live your best life and be positive or whatever. I still feel this way, and it confuses me as much as everyone else. Im not sure if I want to feel the way I do. Itd be nice if I completely forget and never see being depressed as a thing that exists. Its a thing though and I cant seem to shake off that this is how I feel. Im not motivated to do much or if I do have the motivation Im unsure of what to do. So the motivation lingers until its finally gone from my thoughts. Im not sure what Ill do with my life, Im barely living it. Im not a person that I would like to be and Im not focused on life. Ive been trying to make sense of how I feel. My friends dont speak to me, they straight out dont call or text and havent for months. Theyve never really called or texted much, so I question myself and our friendship. I have bad self esteem which makes things wonky. My life has been moderately fine, the colors are just drained. Im also failing and got no motivation for school as well!

    "What is the point? I have been suffering from depression i suppose all my life. However, acknowledgment of it only came 34 years ago. Since acknowledging i have depression, each passing year since I get worst and worst. These last two years have been my lowest with contemplation of harm getting harder to ignore. My 30th birthday was earlier this year and 4 days leading to it the idea of not seeing that birthday was painfully strong. I have no social life. the one friend that i confided in, that relationship has drastically changed. I have no romantic life, and havnt dated in 6 years. and i have no career, recently quitting my job as my mental health plumited, however now i dont think i am good enough for any job so the motivation to look just brings about anxiety and self hate. Note that i have been on lexapro for the last 5 months with my dossage being raised last week, and although it helps regulate my moods a littler better, I am still incredibly sad and hate the pathetic state of my life. I also started therapy the same time i got the perscription and see them one a week. However, although talking out my feelings gives me temporary relief i still dont know the tools needed to be better. I am incredible lonely and dont want to feel this heaviness and self hatred anymore. I guess the reason for my post is to find out if anyone has genuinely overcome their depression to the point that they can say they are truly happy.

She showed me their texts and she was talking about doing it because she wants to kill herself so she wont listen to anyone who tells her to get help. Im thinking about going to the guidance counselor because she already expressed that her parents wont schedule her an appointment even though shes asked.

I was beginning to think this was just my personality now but I know deep down I wasnt always this way I was happy before but I dont really know what went wrong. I just really need to speak to someone who understands but I feel as though if I ever mention it out loud then people will just think Im looking for attention or that I am over reacting. Even if I wanted to tell anyone the words just wont come out. I really need to fix this but I have no idea how. I cant keep going like this. I dont want to die but I dont want to be here either... I know there are people out there who are so much worse with depression than I but I cant handle this anymore I just want to be happy again. Everyday I get angry with people who dont deserve it and I dont even know what ever made me angry. I push people away who just wanted to be my friend. I always have a problem with everything and I am sick of it. Its not fair on others around me to have to walk on eggshells around me. I need to get a grip and fix this and stop being selfish because I am too embarrassed to admit that my mental health has been getting worse over the last few years.. I have spent the last few days researching and doing online tests and I think its time to admit it.

    "Feeling at the end of the line My wife knows about my rape and thanks to her I was able to talk to my sister about it too, needless to say I broke my sisters heart but also made us closer, she also was kind enough to pay for private professional help for me and her to deal with this, I also opened about this with an uncle my mothers brother who I thought was someone completely different to what he turned out to be, when I told him about the rape he broke hard and I took him to talk with the therapist I was seeing thanks to my sister, and what she told me before the therapist and told to him later changed everything, she said that I needed some sort of compensation for what had happened in order to move on, it wasnt possible to get legal justice due the time frame of the events and the lack of evidence beyond my word and she didnt suggest anything more beyond that we should try to figure it out, of course telling the whole family was my first thought and let the truth have its day, but my uncle mothers brother begged me not to tell anything because it would destroy the family, specially my mother who has a lot, and I mean a lot of love for the uncle who raped me, she my mother basically raised him the first 4 years of his life because his parents had a busy and privileged life and he the rapist is seen by the rest of the family as a great guy and an example, with this he mothers brother convinced me not to tell anything, I know I could have just said no and told everything to everyone but thinking what could I possibly put my mother through after seeing how his brother took the news made me feel trapped and basically Ive been living feeling like a prisoner and the responsible for my entire family being together or not. My dear wife, my love, only she keeps me sane holding me when Im about to broke and unfortunately with all that Ive mentioned before about not being able to get a job it has begun to be a frequent occurrence and I can see it is taking a toll on her, Ive busted my eyes and my back studying and working hard on small jobs non related to my career just to keep us going and whenever seems to be an opportunity all I get are rejections or I get to watch people getting jobs because of political favors, and what has led me here is the thought that I am the common factor in all of this, and everyone specially my wife would be better off if I am no more, we would love to be able to begin a family but it would be so irresponsible to bring a child to this world under this circumstances, and this also makes my wife so sad, she cries in my shoulder but tells me that we will pass this and everything will be fine, but Ive lost almost all hope, and given our age and financial situation it looks that if she keeps being by my side she will never have the family and the life she deserves.",

She cleared out her childhood bedroom and we thought it would be fun to read trough old diaries since Im not doing great at the moment. But we eventually read mine too. I forgot how dark my notes were. It was honestly very eye opening but I think reading about my suicidal thoughts, in the current situation concerned her a lot. This morning, she handed me the letter, saying Id have to read it when Im feeling down. She wrote about our friendship, how we give each other the courage to be ourselves, how much Ive helped her, how much she wants to be there for me. I read the letter twice, I cried both times. Now I feel guilty for worrying her. How do I respond?",
    "I dont love/like my mother and idk if the relationship is worth salvaging. Another thing she been on methadone for like 13 years, thats not how methadone should work but fuck it im no doctor. 4 years later she makes a big deal about money and all this stuff and i go to find out that, first she never used my money to pay rent, it turned out from me talking to our landlord that she owed almost 6 months of backrent! I also found out that the boyfriend didnt contribute to any of the finances so at a young age she put her financial responsibility in my hands. We ended up getting evicted and I was pissed and didnt talk to her for 2 years then she got cancer. So i did what i felt was the right thing and was there for her regardless. She got better and now well this whole thing came from a argument the other day we had. I have major depression and i was trying to ask for help and she got mad at me cause i told her i cant talk to her about it. She asked why and i told her the truth that i dont wanna have a who had a sadder life competition. Because she has a habit of if i was to complain about my childhood instead of listening or sympathizing she would bring up things like oh i was molested my childhood wasnt that great. Yeah thats fucking terrible and all that but that doesnt excuse your decision for you children. Youre supposed to work to make things better for them. Which is the only valuable life lesson she taught me, because she never did it. Now im in a ok place Im in school full time work 2 jobs all so i can have a easier life, and she dont understand that Im busy even though i told her this. Honestly shes the reason for a lot of my depression. it sucks having to coddle a parent, i have no guidance i feel lost half the time and she will never understand that.",
    "I really need help I need help I have a step dad and a rather emotionless mother. Theyve always been very bossy in a way. By that I mean they do whatever they want to and they dont care about my opinion at all. And when I try to talk to them calmly they just say stuff like  This is how we are and you cant do anything about it. They also call me hopeless a lot of times and say personal things to me and this has always happened but I expected it to stop when I turned 18 a month back. Theyre currently angry at me and theyre blocking the wifi and my sim card for no apparent reason and I just feel so helpless. I cant talk to them or make them understand how I feel. When I told my mother that I have nobody in this house to talk to she said aw youve had such a sad childhood youre so innocent but im sorry thats just how it is. They take away my phone whenever theyre upset and Im stuck in the house because of quarantine and I just dont know what to do. And to make it a little clear, my real dad was an abusive alcoholic and my mother STILL says stuff like that to me. Ive also lost touch with almost every friend I have. I do talk to them but its empty talk. I only really have one person in my life that I can talk to, and that is my girlfriend. Just the thought of her not being there makes me feel so alone Can anyone who has been through the same stuff please guide me on what I can do? I feel so depressed and frustrated its killing me",
    "Suicidal Thoughts I think about killing myself every week. Every time I do, I feel like Im inching more and more toward the day Id actually do it, like Im on a train speeding toward a cliff and theres nothing I can do to stop it. I compose the letters Id leave behind bit by bit in my head. Brother, youre the firstborn son our parents shouldve had, and youll do a much better job at it than I have. I love you and Im truly sorry for everything. Sister, I love you too and Im sorry for everything. Dad, I know you only wanted to do good. I know you wanted the best for us. I know you tried. Im sorry I couldnt be the son you wanted to have. And Im sorry for destroying your marriage. Pray for me. As to my mother, I couldnt even begin to think of the words Id leave behind for her. She deserves more. She deserves more than she ever had. I know I shouldnt be feeling this way and thinking like this but Im a burden, a bug in the matrix and they will all be better off without me. I came to a happy family and I ruined everything. I feel irrevocably, irreconcilably lost. I dont fit anywhere, I dont belong with anyone and wherever I take refuge Im eventually discovered to be the anomaly I am. My brain bullies me, my dad lost hope on me and I feel like an injured kid that has fallen into a well and is crying for help. Im aware Im looking for sympathy here and that makes my squirm into myself and want to disappear. Any torch of hope is much appreciated. Thank you for reading.",
    "Should I get myself checked in to a psychiatric ward so they can force me to start my antidepressant? I have anti nausea medication, and I can take that while starting. This option has upsides and downsides too. First of all if I ask them for anti anxiety medication Im guaranteed to be seen as a drug seeking patient. They did that before and I dont even have any drug abuse history. Even if I get them I might not have the willpower to start them. I might end up getting an anxiety attack even if I take anti anxiety medication. Okay here is the part where Im talking about stuff I dont really know much about. The anti nausea medication I have is Zofran. From what I understand the reason antidepressants cause nausea is because they increase the levels of serotonin in the brain and the digestive system. As a result of that the increased levels of serotonin agonizes the 5HT3 receptors and this causes nauseavomiting. With repeated use the 5HT3 receptors become downregulateddesensitized and because of that nauseavomiting stops. Now if I were to take Zofran it will prevent me from getting nauseous because it will prevent serotonin from agonizing the 5HT3 receptors, since its a 5HT3 antagonist. But that means it will also prevent 5HT3 receptors from downregulateddesensitized, because they arent being excessively agonized, and when I stop taking Zofran I will become nauseous or I will vomit, and that defeats the whole purpose of taking Zofran. I dont want to take Zofran continuously because it comes with its own side effects. End of the part where Im talking about stuff that I shouldnt be talking about. So now the upsides of the second option. I wont have to deal with the psych ward. Considering the healthcare system in my country, I have good reasons to believe that the care they provide at the ward is not good enough. I wont have to do a lot of explaining to my parents. I wont have to risk abuse and stuff like that. The revolving door syndrome appears to be very prevalent with the mental health facilities in my country.",
    "Has anyone tried brain stimulation therapy? Sorry if this has been asked before I cant seem to find many people talking about their own experience. I saw an ad for it in my psychiatrists office and dont know how to feel. Ive been on medication since I was 14 and it all seems to wear off eventually, leaving me back where I started, so the idea of treatment for people whose depression is medicationresistant sounds helpful. Anyone able to tell me their experience? Did it help? Do you like how it felt? Do you feel it lasts?",
    "Antidepressants Hi guys, i have been struggling with depression for the last 10 years. I have decided to seek help of myself from a psychiatrist doctor. They prescribed me medicines actually antidepressants. I am reluctant to taking any as they are actually legal drugs... I never smoked cigarettes and drunk alcohol in my life thanks to the early awareness and my school and college friends company. I have taken anti depressants for 3 days. I had headaches, heaviness, numbness of tongue and jaw but serenity in my mind... Therefore, i stopped it. Now, if there any body who have gone through severe depression and anxiety come out without medicines. Dont tell me meditation as i cant do it... Please help",
    "Any advices you would like to share on uplifting self esteem and self awareness ? I have been facing depression over the past couple of years but it only accelerated last 6 months when I lost my job and moved back with my narcissistic parents. Thanks to my over protective and overly concerned parents, I turned out to be an adult who cannot standup to himself, who turned out to be a weakling, lack basic social skills and more importantly does not have the faintest idea who he is, what makes him happy, or the very least what he wants to do with his life. I have been living suicidal over the past 2 months, researching on methods I could deploy to end this no good life, having no point in living. But to be honest, I guess somewhere down there, there is something that tells me that not all doors have closed. I recently had a quick convo with a therapist and with the intial analysis she put forward with my situation, she mentioned that the probable root caus,e that is prone for a quick fix is my lack of self awareness and self esteem. I felt that is true, because I sort of feel like I do not have an identity, like.. Having an opinion on somethinganything, having the strength to stand up to myself, knowing what it is that makes me happy, be it a hobby or an interest. I mean when I spend time with people, maybe friends, or colleagues. They tend to know a lot about the world. Some may be knowledgeble about basic things people should know, some maybe a youtube content provider or some other maybe a social point of source. I want to do something with my life as well like being good at something, but all I do is consume datainformation reddit,trivial information etc.. and not produce any maybe writing a blog because I cant understand what fancies me. ampx200B I want to make my life better, but I just dont know where to begin and I feel like so Lost !",
    "Cheated on my girlfriend by dating a girl I met online playing games This all happened while I was still dating my girlfriend while she was away for an internship. So I met a nice girl online playing a game almost like 2 months ago and the vibes between us are good. I confessed to her and wr started dating online. The only problem is that she seems to suffer from depression and im trying to help her, sometimes staying really late or not sleeping just to keep her company, playing games with her, shes really beautiful. Shes from another country not far from here, and I want to meet her. My girlfriend came back recently and found out about that I was texting and dating another girl. I dumped my girlfriend inmediately after this. I feel really sorry for her. From time to time I still miss her, last week I had been trying to contact her to make it up but she ghosted me. I miss the intimacy with her. I tried with another number but shes not picking up my calls nor answering. What should I do?, any kind of advice would be appreciated.",
    "Please help, i am so tired Can someone please explain? So i dated this guy one year ago. He became severely depressed and we kept texting when he felt like it.

He seemed happy about it and we agreed to meet that evening. But then he texts me last minute saying his best friend is at his place and he forgot they were going to have diner together. He then gave me all kinds of new options, and I then asked if today was okay, but i still didnt get a text back... it has been 3 days I dont know what to do anymore. Should i send him another text?

    "Am I Disabled Enough? I latch onto my own escape in the form of my high school boyfriend. Im eighteen, 140 kilos and move out of the room I share with my sister into a unit with my boyfriend who, you probably guessed it, was abusive. over time he conditioned me to stay away from technology but the tv and Xbox, cut what few friends I had out, only family I could really see without some sort of manipulative guilt trip was my mother because shed drive me straight into his arms. He had control of everything, finances, time, everything. so now Im twenty three, married and pregnant with my first child. completely isolated and dependant.

I escape her when Im 24 and bubs nine months old for my own house but i dont fully shake her free until two years after that. Obviously as from all the above, I am not a mentally stable person. For my daughter I start to try and sort myself out. until my daughter is five, I took those years to do some inward looking and healing. I go to therapy, I find a antidepressant that works, I clip out the bad and keep only those positive influences. I have Depression, anxiety and PTSD. I have a medical diagnosis of only the Depression so far but the others are being worked on in therapy. When my kid is five i start dating and just before shes six I meet a wonderful guy who really IS wonderful! I made my therapist check. He is very understanding of my trust issues and agreed to sit with me on sessions Now to the disabled part. currently, I am 30 with a seven year old girl and a eight month old girl. Im in a stable relationship with a solid partner. Due to Covid and rising Rents, we were forced to move in with his parents and His sister who live with his grandparents.

    "i had to say goodbye to my sweet boy today after finding out yesterday cancer is ravaging his body. the vet said he has never seen anything like what was shown on those scans, that my sweet maximus was a very very sick little boy. the inside of his spleen was supposed to look like peanut butter, but instead it looked like chunky jelly with chunks and lumps he could not identify. his body had developed multiple tumors, which were cancerous. he had gone into tumor lysis crisis meaning that a large amount of the cancer cells that were comtained in these tumors died, and released their cancerous contents into his blood. they were killing his red blood cells and destroying the ability to regenerate any at all. his stomach had bloated 3x its normal size, even though it was just later in the day and yesterday morning it had looked fine. the vet discouraged us from treatment because he didnt see any possible way maximus could recover putting him on treatment would only prolong his suffering and ensure he passed painfully. which is cruelly ironic, as putting him on treatment would keep my suffering at bay. but i have to do right by my boy. hes been through too much and endured more than i can imagine, he was brought into this world in pain and i promised him when i brought him home he would leave it in love. i had to keep that promise. i love him more than it seems like my heart can handle, and making the right decision for him is the absolute utterly wrong decision for me. we got the vet this morning and despite not moving except to lift his head the past few days, he trotted off away from the building. i believe in the deepest place of my heart he knew what we were there for, and he was scared. he wouldnt let me turn him around back toward it, and the most he would take was two steps toward the building and then sit back down. i sat down with him and just sobbed. the thought of not having that big brown baby rips my heart into shreds and pierces my soul. we finally got him inside after i just sat with him and talked to him for about 15 minutes. ive never wanted to simply wait in a waiting room longer, but they called us right back.",

Were a pretty sad family all together honestly, but thats all Ive known from them. ampx200B For some backstory My dad 61M fixed up my grandparents old house the one my mom grew up in over the course of a few years.

How she misses the old house that they spent over 30 years in, how she hates every tiny thing my dad does, just blaming him for everything. She cried into my arms tonight asking what she has to look forward to everyday, to just tell her something good in her life to look forward to. And no matter what I said she would just cry harder. ampx200B I dont know what to do to help her, if anything.

    "I’m lonely and depressed Then we were sent home. My friend and I who happened to be on two flights took some edibles before. We had to leave at 330, so we didnt bother sleeping before we went to the airport. These edibles hit HARD. Once I got to the gate wed be waiting at, I was paranoid. There was people around. These people might have COVID19. The seat Im sitting on might have COVID19. I cant escape it. It is everywhere. Whenever I heard someone cough, it felt like an impending bioweapon. But I was trapped in this airport and couldnt avoid it. I had a minipanic attack in the washroom. I got on the flight, and it was surreal. I hasnt really processed things yet. But I started to drift off to sleep, and saw myself at the house we were staying, with everyone in my volunteer group around. Then I woke up. And the whole world came rushing into me. I was on a flight. I was leaving. I was going home. I might not see some of those people ever again. My volunteer program experience was now in the past, and I couldnt change that. I wanted to cry. Its not like I even really LIKED everyone in my group. But after spending almost three months living with them, I was still attached to them. And it was hard to leave that behind. After a blurry 14 hours, I finally got to my home airport. My parents met me there and picked me up. I told them how things went, but its impossible to really communicate my experience. I got home, but realized I wasnt really home. Things were different. Society has morphed into a nightmarelike dystopia. Im not even allowed to see all my friends.

    "Depressed person trying to support a depressed person I thought it would be easier to think of ways to help someone I know who is showing signs of depression because I too am depressed, but its actually so hard. I know just being there is such a big part but Im NOT there and cant be, we live across the country from each other. How do I let someone know Id be happy to talk to them as long as physically possible if they wanted to without it coming across as babying or OTT, because I truly would stay up for days talking to this person if they wanted, or even if they didnt, I love them so much, I love talking to them and I think theyre such a cool person, and want to convey that without it coming across as mollycoddling. They called me last night in the middle of the night whilst drunk, which they never do, and when I got in touch this morning they text saying they pressed the wrong button not possible unless theyve made no calls in the last two weeks, they would have had to search for my number and call me and joked about being at a friends student halls this week and feeling so alienated, Im worried about them. I told them to give me a call when theyre back home to tell me all about it but now Im worried theyll take that as me not wanting to talk now, which they might want to. Ahhhhh its difficult, trying to strike the balance between showing you care and not treating someone like a child is like, impossible.

I feel like such a failure. Everything is falling apart and I have no one to talk to and nothing I can do. I tried winning her back several times. I bore my soul. She doesnt want me or doesnt love me or both, and it tears me up inside. All I ever did was love her. I was just going through a real bad fit of depression, for longer than I think I was. I just feel so lost.",
    "Depression after graduating university I graduated from university a few months ago and am in limbo back home with my parents. I am supposed to be applying for jobs but I feel completely paralysed with fear. I have always suffered from incredibly low selfesteem. My parents are really critical of me so I have started avoiding seeing them and just spending my time in my room alone. Friends are all busy with work and university. I feel incredibly low. I have not left the house in 11 days now and can barely muster up the energy to brush my teeth and shower each day. My days have no structure and I just eat junk food as I feel too lethargic to prepare proper meals for myself. Each day I wake up late 11amish and then count down the hours until 7pm when I can start getting ready for bed again. Getting into bed is perhaps the highlight of my day as it means another day of my life is over with. My mum just came in my room and told me I need to sort myself out. She finds it all pathetic and is angry at me. I get it. But that is not what I need. Can she not see that I am not well at the moment? I also have been suffering with anxiety. Everyday there is something new to worry about. Yesterday I thought I had breast cancer, a couple of weeks ago it was cervical cancer, etc. Even applying body lotion to my arms I am scared I am going to see a dodgy mole. I just feel so hopeless. But I get these brief moments of sadness when I think to what I was like this time last year. I was in university, surrounded by friends, top of my year, genuinely springing out of bed to go to university. I dont know how it went bad so quickly. I know I can turn it around. Sunday night I prepared a simple todo list to just look for jobs and identify three I wished to apply to. A simple task which breaks down the scary process of job hunting down to tiny steps but it is Wednesday and I still have not done that.",
    "Should I click yes to give the psychiatrist permission to share my information with one of my parents? What are they gonna share? So I finally opened to my parents that Ive been struggling with depression, but didnt tell them the exact main reason why because of how much embarrassment and shame I feel over it. Theyve been supportive and let me set up an appointment with a psychiatrist. Theres a part that asks if they have permission to share my information with them. I really dont want them knowing about the real reason why Im depressed. I feel like Im obligated to click yes because I am on their insurance. What should I do?",
    "Death Anxiety Like, Ill feel great doing these things and then Ill think that was nice, but Im going to forget that it happened and cease to exist eventually. Ugh. The whole thing makes life feel unreal and dreamlike. Im scared to die. I want to be alive. I want my self to be connected to everything. I dont want to fade away into nothing. Ive tried spirituality and I will continue to because i think does help more like a temporary fix though, but its based on so many opinionsmaskingastruths that my overactive brain just wont stop picking it apart and reducing it whenever I try to participate. I guess Im sad that Im stuck right now being a reductionist and a realist, and that my inner self seems to want to do this even though I know Im much happier when Im blissfully ignoring these kinds of questions. Now I get the sense that if I ever want out of this, Ill have to think my way out but every time I try it seems to make it worse. I dig myself deeper into this pit by engaging with it. I can feel myself enjoying music, art, video games, podcasts, books and movies less. They all feel like distractions, which I guess everyone kinda knows they are, but it just feels really clear and I wish it wasnt. If any of this sounds like you, and youve gotten past it, please let me know. Note I switched up my meds and they do seem to be helping with stuff like anxiety attacks and suicidal ideation but the depression feels deeper than just a chemical imbalance",
    "Don’t know how to create a goal to motivate myself to keep living Ive been at my lowest point I have ever been, ive been here for the past 3 months ish. And ive been struggling for so many years, but right now I have nothing and no one, I know I should eat, sleep and exercise better, but I dont have the motivation to do anything, I go to bed at 89am recently, god knows what I eat, I cant remember but its not good.

    "Should I kill myself? I am the most uninteresting person and I feel like I am the only one who puts effort into any of my relationships. My other 2 friends ended up dating and stopped talking to most people becsuse of that. At the start of 2020 after the breakup, I started getting into philosophy actually and began focusing on including stoicism and other ways of being into my life. Just accepting that things go wrong but thats okay. Its very hard and I obviously have yet to achieve it but I wanted to learn to be happy even if I didnt have everything I want. I began journaling what I did and didnt like about myself and tried to become a better person. This awkard phase went on for a while, I would talk to my cousin for comfort. We would call and game, though honestly, I lost interests in games. I started craving to play the piano again and by 2021 I decided to get back into it. I practice a lot and can play a couple chopin pieces, but I still am not very good so its not something I can like show off to people. Also I became incredibly more awkward, in trying to better myself, I became super apologetic and passive. I struggle to joke around because I dont want to offend, or I just feel awkward. I never know what to say, and I am always trying to think like is this what a good person does. Which inches closer to today. I struggle so hard with making friends, I dont have much interesting skills. I dont have much hobbies besides piano, business, and like history. I am not super funny. I am awkwrd and uncomfortable with new people. I am needy. I am dependent on social interaction yet I get none. I am not as good looking as I once was. I feel so unattractive. Like why would anyone want to be friends with me, and no matter how hard I try to get out there or be interesting, it seems I am always the one putting all of the effort to relationships. I am the one chasing, and no one is giving me any thought. I actually am in a relationship though, we started dating in april.",
    "Just not good enough I guess? So first time ever posting on Redditt so sorry if I mess up. So today is my birthday and its honestly just been the worst day ever. I usually just stay home and play video games or spend the day with my daughter. But today was terrible. So my brother invited me to have a little party at his house I thought ok this will be a good thing. Well once I got there I found out I had to cook all the food and also my own birthday cake which is ok I guess maybe Im just being picky? But then my boyfriend starts a fight with me because I went when I thought he didnt remember and he didnt have anything planned so I ruined that as well. So now Im sitting in my bathroom in tears because my brother said that Im just being sensitive and stupid and then my boyfriend is saying that I ruined everything. Like what did I do wrong today for it to be my birthday I didnt get to do anything I wanted at all. Maybe Im just being silly over nothing? I dunno know maybe I did ruin everything for everyone.",
    "I think I’m slipping into insanity Hey all, need a bit if supportadvice As of recently, Ive noticed Ive been having a lot more breakdowns than I usually have. These have gotten to the point where Ive begun to push the important people out of my life. On the flip side, I dont do anything with my life. Besides the global quarantine we currently have due to COVID, I just.... do nothing. I feel bad because I have no job, so Im constantly asking for money from my parents, which I then spend like a madman, and, again, I just sit at home and play video games all day, despite telling myself to do other things. This, along with recent events, has left me highly aggressiveabrasive. Thing is, I recognize that this is not me, and Im basically trapped under impulse. What can I do? Is this Psych Ward or MRIworthy? Does anyone know of ways I can get help online or through an app?",

Im just a support character for whoever Im around. I dont have someone I can talk to. I dont know what else to say. How do pull yourself out of a hole like this? Im so tired.",
    "Why do I even bother? I never get any replies on this subreddit, but here I am again prostrating myself to all who dare to read my post! I suffer from insomnia, migraines, chest pain, muscle pain, the list goes on and on. My body is a broken temple, and I am but nineteen years old, yet the doctors claim nothing is wrong with me. Not a day goes by when I dont consider suicide due to my physical maladies. My physical maladies are only the start! After all, according to my Psychiatrist, I have Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, ObsessiveCompulsive Disorder, and Autism. My father didnt want to raise me. I have a mother who berates me regularly and my stepfather who is an angeraddict. I dont have any friends. Ive had five jobs in the past 365 days, but none of them have worked out. Hell, I cant even figure out for gender identity or sexual orientation for crying out loud! I know someone is going to tell me to go see a therapist and a doctor, but all I can say is that I do. It doesnt matter. Im broken. I expect to die of esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, or some other such terminal disease. Life has lost all its meaning. I would rather be dead that going through all this suffering. And nobody seems to ever read my posts, and if they do, they write insulting replies. I am worse than Hitler and Stalin combined. I dont even know what Im saying anymore. Im going to take some medication to gain me three or four hours of sleep. I know nobody will read this, so who cares? Pizza! Pineapple! Carl Jung! Dead babies! Quantum Mechanics!",

To this day, I cant ever get any medication for it either, but I save that little later. ampx200B By 12th grade, my grandfather had passed away, and he was the only thing I had to father like. My depression hits me harder and I just no longer had any desire for school. I begin skipping so much school that I was dropped from the program. I only stayed home, watch t.v and played video games. I get a job and I stayed there for five years. Naturally I find other work over time and keep going with jobs I hate. I move in with my mother at some point, I thought it be a good idea and grow closer to her. ampx200B My mother goes on to lie and steal from me the entire time Im with her. I had even tried to go back to school and get my GED but told down a lot. I pay money for something, and they would pocket it. I would sleep, and they steal my credit card and spend my entire paychecks. I was often treated like a third class citizen while living with them. ampx200B While attending GED school, it a massive struggle for me. I cant focus longer than 30 minutes and only a few times a week if that. I still have no medication to get back on or a way to get them. To this day, Im quite afraid to ever try for it, in thinking Im making it up, you last this long why now you need them. So yeah, I dont ever get it and it alwaysjust something I hate myself for. I just feel like Im lazy and crap because I cant focus on. I did end up getting half of the credits credit for GED, where I am at you dont have to take all the test at once. You can take each test one at a time. Im only needing math and science which both I have a tough time focusing on. Both take the longest to learn and hardest for me to stay still for. ampx200B At some point, I grow homeless and then move into with a relative and then kicked out after getting a bunch of money from me.",
    "Student nurse with severe depression bout - how can I help? My fiancee is a student nurse after a career change and is currently in her second year. She had setbacks due to COVID and a broken wrist which still requires a reset operation that she is putting off because of training. Her last placement was absolute hell and she had deliberately obstructive staff rather than anyone who would sign off her competencies. She has a history of severe depression and is taking medication, but has really gone downhill for the last month or longer. On the worst days she is barely able to take care of herself and of course it puts our relationship under terrible strain, but I try to help and support where ever I can.

    "Am I too demanding? How to deal with cultural differences I am a master student that study abroad. I had miscalculation on financial stuff and everyone in my new country is very individualistic.

Every time I asked people at the university or government what should I do to fix my problem. They told me to find a friend if I could not figure it out by myself.

I should get a close friend because I keep getting the answer you can use google or I cannot help you. I dont like to go to a party or bar. I am too depressed to do fun stuff.

However, when I told my problem to people that I met online in my the new country, most people would reply with, You should search people in real life or You seems put lots of chores to your friend or You should stop searching for boyfriend.

Her mother genuinely blames her phone for her problems, even the aches.

Her sister would probably just push god onto her if she went to her again. She selfharms by bruising herself and has had thoughts of suicide. As mentioned before, she has substance abuse issues.

    "Still on the fence For a long while now I have been depressed and havent really had many close friend and for a little bit hitting a point of literally just 1 semi close online friend and no body else at all, but thats besides the point. For the last probably month or 2 I have been on the fence or just cant decide on what to do with one side being just live a happy life with a tightly knit group of girl and maybe online friends with possibly even a relationship and the other side being suicide. For the longest time Ive been leaning back and forth and thanks to friends Im feeling better some time but thanks to school and alot of punishments and groundings every so often and fairly recently having moved between states pushing me the other way. Im not sure if this is just me or amazingly common but I just dont know what to do any more and I want to be able to land on the right side of the fence on my feet and not fall back into a pit sorry if its an odd analogy. I just really dont know what to do since the only people who ever really reach out to me are semi close friends and just some school mates ending nonsense. All I do if sit around mostly unmotivated to make a difference and better things for myself by simple even doing homework but instead I feel like a lazy bum who uses his only bit of motivation to ask a handful of friends how their day was when I see them only but still feel like Im just pestering them. I mean its been almost half the school year now and the only person who sits next to me because they want to and not because their entire group moved to where I sit is my semi close friend I mention earlier. Ive got nearly no friends, got near nonexistant privacy, no motivation, and the only 2 things that I can always look back on for a reason to keep going are Im my dad only child and he put 15 years of effort into making my last this long and just the simple question of how can I do it quick without it hurting too much or looking a fool.",

    "The Story of This Year The girl came home and rushed me to hospital while the other one stayed at the party to get drunk. The girl was very supportive and stayed with me the entire time at the hospital, my other room mate, Max, didnt visit me at all. I considered Max a brother too me, I loved him dearly and I tried to do whatever I could for him to show how much I appreciate him. When he didnt visit me it really got to me and upset me. We spoke and he was angry and upset with me for doing what I did, so I left the house for over a week and stayed at the flat where I used to stay. I waited for him to calm down and I went home, I didnt want him to be angry and upset with me so I thought I would give him the space. I started seeing counsellors and psychiatrists. My counsellor helped me quite a bit, she was the first counsellor Ive actually enjoyed talking too and looked forward to seeing. We worked through my problems and she came to the conclusion that leaving the house would be for the best and she supported my decision of going back to college, so I did. After I told my room mates I was doing this they hated me. They didnt want to speak to me or see me. They said some pretty nasty things to me, and I back to them. I lost my two best friends, and my brother. Its been just over 2 months since Ive moved out and Im still miserable about it all. I think about them everyday and I see all their Snapchats together and it ruins me because we used to do everything together. Because I left my lease Im in debt up to my eyebrows. I had to come up with a bond and 2 weeks rent for my college and I have to come up with money for the bills towards the house that I still havent paid, and unable to afford. Ive taken out 3 loans since leaving which has put me through further debt and I dont know what to do. The last 3 weeks have been the worst for me.

I havent even studied for the one AP class I do have, and I only have it since Im in an academic program that I cant get out of.

Ive been drowning and screaming for help, yet no one has helped. I caught on to my depression so early that it actually had a chance of being cured if I had gotten immediate help. I did not, and now I feel like dying will make the world a better place for everyone around me. Ill no longer have to make eye contact with old friends, or be a burden to my dad. Ill no longer have to worry about feeling lonely or having one sided conversations anymore. Ill be happier. I dont want to live for anyone, since that is selfish to the person who asks me to live for them, their happiness. I cant picture a future life for me anymore. I tried telling my old friend about my depression, and she said stuff along the lines of I can relate though I dont have depression. Im aware that shes trying to connect with me since she doesnt know what to say, but it makes me feel invalidated, like my feelings are just your normal sadness.

    "Finally able to get professional help but.... How do I do it correctly? Hi. Sorry that I cant split this long post into paragraphs, Im on mobile and it just hasnt been letting me do it.

Ive been struggling with mental problems that are incredibly similar to common clinical depression symptoms loss of motivation, emotional numbness, insomnia, suicidal thoughts, anxiety attacks, low selfesteem, and some more we dont have to bring up since I was about 10 and continuing since then.

What do I do? I mean, I know how to bring up my insurance and payment methods in a professional manner but thats all I know I can do. Do I bring up my problems before the appointment so that she can be prepared, or do I wait? Whats the formality usually like for these things?

I was out of town for the worst of it, and was lucky enough to come home to all of utilities still on, no damage to the house, nothing. I even had a good amount of food in the pantry. I housed a few friends, and donated to some organizations, but still feels like Im not doing enough. Specifically Ive been invited to volunteer this weekend alongside other people from my industry. However, yesterday I wanted to get my house in order first, but ended up lying in bed, and eventually falling asleep for a few hours, because it all just seemed so overwhelming. Cue guilt for neither volunteering nor getting anything done around the house. Today Im in the same boat. I apologized and told the volunteer crew Id definitely be coming today, but again the house is still a mess, and I need to get it back in shape before I go back to working full time tomorrow. Funny thing is that I could totally do both, but my depressionanxiety tells me I just need to hide in bed all day instead. Frustrating, because four months ago I started taking medication been in therapy for longer and its been incredibly helpful, but it cant seem to take the edge off during this time of crisis....even though Ive hardly been affected personally. Im spiraling because I feel such a duty to help others, but I know I need to help myself first...and seems that I can do neither right now. Any helpadvicesupport would be appreciated!",
    "Afraid of not being depressed Is it normal for me to be afraid of getting better? Im 18 and I have been depressed for around 5 years. It has become normal for me to not like living, and the thought of enjoying life scares me. Im literally afraid of not being depressed somehow. Its like I have to step out of my comfort zone. The thought of not me actually wanting to live feels like I lose my identity, like I have to become a different person. I dont know how to live without depression, and I dont want to live with my depression anymore. I either have to kill myself or choose to live, but how do I tackle the fear of not being depressed?",
    "I'm Not Coping Im having a really hard time coping lately. I went no contact with my borderline mom and in doing so cut contact with my family as well. I am also off of my arthritis medication which has brought back 247 nonstop pain. I can feel my mental health dwindling with each tick of the clock and I just keep going down deeper into the hole. Ive been sick and stuck at home since Valentines Day and it feels like a live rendition of the Yellow Wallpaper as I slowly give up and give in to my depression.",
    "Advice/Help Hi there! So I decided to create a new Reddit account to write this. Im not sure if this is the right subreddit  but thought Id want to just talk about things. I have been dealing with anxiety for around 3 years now, and have been experiencing depressive symptoms for around a month. I dont want it to sound like Im complaining  but I just feel exhausted. Im tired of always trying to be better, to improve and hoping that things will change. I had seen different psychologists over those 3 years, and although one had worked really well for me  the rest felt like I was just talking about my problems without actually coming up with a solution. Honestly, it feels a little bit surreal for me to even be writing a post  because Ive tended to lurk reddit for so long and just read things. I know people say that things will get better, and yes  there is COVIDlockdown. I just become so angry with myself that Im not improving at the rate that I really want to be. And I honestly dont even know where to start to initiate that improvement. I guess I just really want help.",
    "Life’s going downhill and everything that happens is mainly my fault For starters Im 13 years old. Im in the 7th grade and this issue has been going on for what Id say about a year now. I dont know if whats going on even is depression, maybe Im just being edgy. To be frank, I have no idea anymore. The more I stress about it the more I try talking about it with my friends, and sometimes they ignore it, other times they tell me to stop being emo. Also, FYI, this will be really long. The fact of the matter is that things havent been going well. We can start at my grades. You see, my brother age 25 is a collage dropout and my sister age 21 is still doing great and Im happy for her. The thing is that because my brother had dropped out of collage he has a job now and is starting to get back on track and is still living with my parents and struggling, I feel this pressure that I need to do well and be the best I can to not end up like him. Im sure thats normal, but the one problem is my mother. I always try to satisfy her, seeing the smile and satisfaction on her face is my dream, but she never seems to be satisfied. If I brought home Bs that wasnt good enough. If I got an answer wrong on my test even though I still got a good grade it wasnt good enough because I got something wrong. When I brought home my interim, I got 3 Bs and 4 As and when she saw, all she did was ask if I needed help because my grades were dropping. It hurt me. She wants me to become an orthodontist. When I brought home this report thingie on my level 15 on english and writing, I got a level 5. Only 7 of students in my state got that. However there was also one for science and math, I got a level 4 on that, which is what most people in my state got. When she saw, she told me to do better because I math and science are more important for becoming a orthodontist. I feel helpless. My next issue is this incident that happened with my crush.",
    "How to get brave enough to kill yourself PLEASE NOTE I am not in any danger to myself at this time so no need for urgency. TLDR self hate, worthlessness, getting over fear of death. Im just so tired of living. Ive always hated myself and people since a very early age and I cannot trust anyone. I feel absolutely wrong in this world. Everything I do or say or think is wrong. Since day one I was wrong. I cant do anything right like honestly not trying to exaggerate here and cant make any connections with anyone. Im actually unable to feel love or compassion or any sort of human connection. Dont even get me started on sex Im sick of watching everyone else get what I cant have. I dont deserve love or kindness and Im honestly sick of being the brunt of a very boring joke. I feel like the universe is constantly telling me I dont belong here I also feel like Im not THAT important to have the universe specifically pick on me. My role in this world is to be unremarkable and useless. I only see evil in the world, I can see no kindness. As long as there is man men, there can be on peace. Since the dawn of time weve chosen violence, death and hate. Even in the 21st century we still are starting wars, having genocides and famine and humans are becoming less and less human or more human?? I cant hold onto friendships or make any solid connections. I can only make friend with people who need someones shoulder to cry on and once theyre done with me, theyre gone. I also cling onto anyone that stays remotely too long and then feel utterly betrayed by the smallest problem they face me with. I freak out at the smallest things like dropping a spoon or having a giant mess. I used to be able to pretend to be happy and healthy and human but, as usual, I cant do that right so Im slipping. I cant stay at a job for longer than a year without freaking out. I work at a job Ive wanted for so long but see how little work or care is actually put in by my fellow coworkers and its maddening.",
    "This is a cry for help... But, I was heartbroken cause I couldnt believe Jane wasnt loyal and committed to me. One night, she told me that shes scared cause she feels like she is one of those girls who meant nothing to me. I told her she was insane and Im in love with her. Until one day when we were at one of my friends house and we were alone, I started making love to her. we didnt have much time so she got pissed off and told me that I was so selfish and I just wanted her for sex and left. This led to our breakup. The next few days we fought and she started flirting with other guys. I couldnt believe everything was falling apart. She told me that she loved me so much but she thinks that I dont love her so her love for me has faded away. She told me that her personality makes her want to date older guys and Ive been acting like a kid. Break can you believe age is this much important for girls in Iran? Well you cant blame them cause they have a lot of father issues, but I really didnt expect it from Jane. I couldnt believe what I heard. I was totally mature and loyal and honest about our relationship and the person who was acting like a kid was Jane the whole fucking time. But I got accused of acting like a kid. We broke up and she blocked me on everything. Its been 3 months since we broke up and it happened in the worst possible time. I couldnt hangout with my friends to ease the pain cause of quarantine. I was lonely the whole time. After quarantine was finished in Iran, I started hanging out with my friends and stuff but there is still a crushing pain deep down in my chest. And you wanna know something funny? I heard she got back together with that asshole who treated her like shit. Obviously knowing that she is this much immature made me realize I dont love her anymore. But I still miss that feeling. I miss being happy in a relationship. I miss being in love. Ive been seeing a therapist since we broke up and she helped me to ease the pain a lot but, Im still extremely depressed.",
    "My cat went missing and I need advice on how to cope. In my previous post I mentioned my cat went missing and I cant really go look for her due to lockdown regulations in my country being so strict that I cant even walk in the street I live in South Africa . Right now it looks like shes not coming back but i am hoping she will. I have struggled with anxiety and depression for years and I am finding it impossible to cope with losing my other cat. My previous cat went missing last year around the same time but at least back then I could look for her and hand out flyers. This cat was my baby and I raised her. She always comforted me when I was sad and was an overall sweetheart. Its like theres a void in my house where she used to be if that makes sense I am so depressed I cant even get out of bed. Is there anything I can do that will help me cope with this? Because I am just so heartbroken and I can see its taking a toll on the people around me as well.",

The good, the bad, anything.

    "How to get myself moving again Ive been suffering from severe depression for the last 18 months. Culminated in a suicide attempt back in December. After that I managed to get myself back on my feet after a while, started therapy and was working on a course I cared about. Just under a month ago, I visited where I used to live to catch up with some friends etc. I felt ready for it. It was a mistake though and it threw me back into a severe depression. Actually my therapist believes I am suffering from PTSD and going back seems to being back a lot of negativity. After 3 weeks of suicidal thoughts, sleeping 18 hours a day and just feeling awful... Im feeling slightly better again, but still not back in a positive place. Id like to get started again on my course and to begin to build back healthy habits. But I sit in front of my laptop and Im really struggling to get myself to do anything at all. Are there any techniques I can use to begin to build up some motion? I know once things begin to move Ill start to feel better again, and long term hopefully therapy and medication can fix this bind Im in... but short term Im struggling to take that first step. In every direction I look, things seem very difficult.",
    "No one respects me or believes in me I have this close female friend who I like but I know probably doesnt like me in a romantic way. Ive asked before, and she turned me down. But shes probably the person Im closest too and who I trust the most in the world. But I figure she doesnt see a future with me because I dont have a career or because Im still hung up on my ex. And I cant go to Facebook or Snapchat anymore because it either gets misunderstood and I get messaged with concern, or I get completely ignored and feel rejected from it. I dont know. It really does feel like as a guy I can only be loved and sought after if I give some or create something that gets peoples attention. Im not loved or sought after for who I am. Thats why Im alone right now in my life, why I seem to be unsuccessful at dating or meeting people. It sucks because that feels like the way for me to get out of this funk that and seeking God. I just dont want another person to tell me to be happy alone, or to tell me to let go. The thing Ive wanted was for someone unprompted to tell me that I mattered to them, that I make their life better by being me. Ive told myself those things, but it fades away when I have less to show for a life I dont want to be living, because I cant right now make things come true or be the only one believing I have a future that seems impossible.",
    "Why can’t I open up to anyone about the things that unsettle me? I am hoping that someone here can help me with this. I have been sexually assaultedI think that thats the proper term without get into detail by my classmates when I was in sixth grade. I have been so ashamed that I didnt tell anyone about this to this day. And I am still not able to work up enough courage to tell anyone my story. I have been writing with this lady from my countries crisis hotline for about two week and I have told her already some things about myself, but they are all rather superficial. I cant see myself opening up to anyone beyond that very small surface level. When I imagine getting a therapist and talking to them I think that I could tell them maybe a little bit more if they were facing me with their back. Its all just so weird. It probably makes no sense to you, I dont understand it either... Someone I wish that I could talk about everything but there is just a barrier in my head making it hard to even type about stuff.

As the TW suggests sometimes lately I have been so distressed and yet apathetic for myself that Ive scratched myself pretty badly. Its like I just think I might as well destroy myself, because I simply can. I know its bad to hurt me and if people see scars Ill be in even more trouble. So why dont I care? Do I think I deserve this? How do I care? Im never going to get better if I do bad stuff like this when Im feeling low.",
    "I think I’m helpless. I am a 19 year old female who has been struggling with depression since I was about 9 or 10. When I started college this past fall, I thought Id get a new start. It went well for the first couple of weeks, but as time went on, my depression took away my chance of making something out of my life. I missed two months of classes because getting out of bed physically made my limbs feel heavier and like I was going to faint. I got a 1.0 GPA last semester and have since then been placed on academic probation. I am taking one class this semester, online. I had a job for most of the school year, but my last day was a few days ago. I am now isolated from society into my room at my parents home with my fish. I try to see my friends, but theyre busy making something out of their lives. My only friend right now is my boyfriend. Con to that, we live in the same city, but he goes to a college two and a half hours away. I dont get to talk to him much since he works 25 hours a week and is also a full time student. I am going to therapy, and it helps a little. However, I am still stuck in my room most days wondering where I went wrong. I hate to just blab on about how hard my life is, but damn. I am stuck. I want to live to see the good days, but these bad days are swallowing me whole. I want to feel better. I want to be a better person. I feel like Im screaming and no one can hear me. My parents refused to take me to the hospital when they caught me trying to kill myself last fall. They dont want their reputation we live in a tightnit, elitist little village to be ruptured by their troubled daughter. Im not sure what to do anymore. Please, someone. Help me.",

    "The current situation has caused a HUGE setback Hey everyone. I hope you are doing better during this crazy time than I am. A bit of background Im a California girl in my 50s. And, Ive struggled for 20 years to fight off very intense anxiety and depression. I have been unable to work since 2014. Ive got a claim for SSDI, but apparently Im not sick enough. SMH I married my high school sweetheart May of 2018. He was the one that got away. I was never happier. After choosing the wrong guys all my life, I finally choose the right guy! Then in October he fell ill with an unknown lung disease. By the 21st of December I lost my love, my best friend he just couldnt breathe anymore. He put up a valiant fight. I was immediately hospitalized in the psych unit. I was overwhelmed with grief. I wanted to die. I wanted to be with him. I even tried several times to make that happen. And to add fuel too the fire, my dad passed away three months after my husband. Im not ashamed to say I was Daddys Little Girl. And I miss him just as much as my husband. So, for a whole year I struggled and fight my depression and anxiety. In that year, I was hospitalized 10 times, for psych and other ailments I have. But sometime after the 1 year mark when he died, I kinda just came out of the fog. I was feeling so much better, reaching out to his mom and other friends. I was so glad that I was gonna beat this. Fast forward to the present. I am an isolater by nature, so this covid19 situation I know I can get through it. I have one good friend and my motherinlaw for support. I keep my appointments with my psychiatrist, and take my meds as prescribed. I have no income, since I have to go through the entire process with Social Security before I can qualify to receive spousal benefits. Basically, what he was earning.

So Im looking for alternative treatments to typical psych drugs. I 21F have depression dysthymia, cyclical depression, anxiety GAD, panic, OCD with dermatillomania, and PTSD. Im currently on Pristiq and Abilify but they dont work. Some things Ive tried 1. Dozens of prescribed meds Zoloft, Prozac, Xanax got addicted, Cymbalta, Buspar, hydroxyzine, bupropion, Trintellix, Wellbutrin, etc. 2. Therapy talk, exposure, acceptance, etc. 3. Supplements NAC, ltheanine, caffeine, vitamin B, vitamin D 4. Illegal drugs mescaline, LSD, LSA 5. Legal drugs Siberian motherwort, dagga, CBD not in a legal marijuana state, kava kava tried today, helped but worried about liver  interactions with other meds I cant afford ketamine therapy. Id consider microdosing LSD but I dont have access to it currently. Anyone got any other ideas? Im kind of at the end of my rope here.",

    "About ready to ghost my mom? My mother is a 20 year TBI survivor due to domestic abuse. As such, her mental standing isnt nearly what it might have been. She has severe memory loss, and personality... inconsistencies. Ive been trying to do as much as I can for her, but lately Im feeling more and more drained. I bought her a cell phone because shes never home long enough to warrant a landline. Ive also replaced it several times when it breaks because she doesnt know what a soft touch is. However, this is where Im starting to lose hope. She enrolled in school, which Im proud of her for. She turns her phone off per teacher requirements, but never remembers to turn it back on. She texts me most nights, and I can almost recite her texts verbatim. However, as soon as she sends her text, she turns it back off. My five year old even knows what grandma does is hurtful. My wife has told her that shes gonna call grandma, and my daughter asked, Why? Her phones off anyway. I can go a week, easily, without physically hearing her voice. Im about ready to just delete her number from my phone and ignore her texts, maybe shell eventually get the hint. I feel like its a catch 22... if I keep her number itll just be a reminder that she only wants to talk when its convenient for her, but if I delete her and show that Im upset itll piss off the rest of my family. I dont know what to do any more. How do I handle someone who is making absolutely no attempt to meet me halfway? Its like she doesnt care about me or my family any more.",

    "Am I to blame for my boyfriends depression? Me and my boyfriend have a really good relationship most of the time. We want the same things and are usually very in sync, until we have a minor disagreement. To me they are mainly about trivial things like chores, but they always escalate because of how we both act. I get frustrated and either get angry and shout or really upset and cry. He just leaves, actually packs up his bags and leaves home. This happened again yesterday and he left. He came to pack his stuff today and after begging him he eventually opened up to me. He said he feels like a shadow of himself with work, friends, family and that he feels so much better away from me. He said some nasty things yesterday but this was really what he thought, and it really hurt me. Ive been doing some research and think he is depressed, I managed to get him to agree to get help today and said i would give him space for a couple of weeks while hes basically said hes seeing if hes better without me.

    "Those who’ve dealt with it longer than I - how? So Im a 20 y.o. F whos currently on her sophomore year in college. I was diagnosed with severe depression and a panic attack disorder about two years ago. Since then Ive dealt with two changes in medication, a suicide attempt and moving away to my own apartment and away from all my family and friends. Since starting school Ive realized Ive become incredibly isolated. The only time Ill have human touch is when my boyfriend visits me for the weekend, and unless a professor or a group member speaks to me, generally throughout the day I wont have a conversation with anyone. Even my parents dont talk to me everyday. Ive joined a DnD group and have made attempts to push myself out of this crippling isolation but how do you make friends when more than have your days are bad mental health days? My depression has worsened significantly since moving and to help myself I got a 3 month old puppy that Im training to be my service animal. Honestly, that baby is most of the reason I get out of bed as puppies dont care if you have depression  they need to be trained. Ive also made another doctors appointment to see about yet another med adjustment. I also got in contact with a therapist but I honestly dont see how it will help much being as though I can only go to one session a month. I just dont know how Im supposed to live like this? Like is this going to be my life from now on just barely struggling by with less than a hand full of people who would actually give a shit if I failed miserably?

    "Feeling at the end of the line A couple years later I met my first long relationship girlfriend and as you can imagine I fell hard for her and spoiled her like crazy, she helped my reconnect with my father and I told her about my trauma and to my surprise she also was a victim, we both tried to get professional help within our means but only I got serious about it and kept going to my sessions, she said she was fine on her own and knowing how hard this was I let her take her own choice and just tried to be supportive when needed, needless to say it ended bad, near the end when we were about to move in together I tried to start a conversation about how we began getting together and how special she was to me, apparently I was the only one that felt that way because she told me that the only reason she kissed me and begun hanging out with me was because she felt pity for me, we had other issues like a poor sexual life and not enough time on her part for us, so after she told me about how we really had begun our relationship I felt numbed and after a few days in emotional hell I broke up with her, I listed all that was wrong with the relationship and told her that something that begins with pity cant have a future, I wasnt able to tell her that that was what hurt me the must, she never apologized and we went our separate ways, her family loved me and knew I was the good guy and I was the best for her and tried to help but never went passed of a small conversation with me, they were harder on her but in the end they are her family, I found out she also cheated later on and it was what killed the last pieces of love I had for her, I didnt confront her about it and we never spoke ever again, the pity confession destroyed my self confidence we were together for close to 4 years. So after that and having gotten some more help with my trauma I went on the quest to become the best version of me and was doing ok, over a year later I meet my current wife, a person so beautiful that has made me feel what is real love and allowed me to love freely again, but another kind of problems fell onto us, financial problems.",

And at this rate, I dont know how long Ill even last if I can get and KEEP a job. I dont know what to do.

    "What can I do to help my family member My brother needs help. Im not sure where to start. He has been drinking pretty heavily for years. Recently he did get help and was put on meds but when the prescription ran out he didnt get another for weeks, has new meds now but hates taking them due to being drowsy and finding hard to function at work. Ive recently moved in with him. I cook and clean for him, chat to him when he wants to chat. He says he doesnt need help or he cant be helped, that hes independent but does thank me any time I do stuff for him. I want to show him hes loved and tell him this. He thinks Im being emotional and not to worry about him. Ive suggested trying different meds, going with him to talk to someone, taking time off work to trial different meds, he agrees he needs time off though feels bad to his team at work amp his boss. I guess I just need advice on what I can do to help and not be overbearing or annoying to him. Hes gotten a lot worse these past few weeks and I cant help but think Its my fault or Im doing something wrong. I cant say Ive ever been in his position so Im at a loss on what to do.",

I tried to become a better person, I started therapy and meds Lexapro 2 weeks ago. But two days ago she sent me an email telling me she doesnt love me anymore, that shes happy without me as a partner. She also told me to stop sending her messages until I move on, that our relationship is over, but she would like to be friends some day. She sounded so condescending and harsh, she also had depression and anxiety, but she started getting better before leaving me.

What do people even talk about, how do you get started? Even new people at work make friends with each other, but I feel like they all think Im just weird or perhaps a bitch simply because Im so awkward and probably say the wrong thing all the time, or maybe I just dont say anything when I should.

I know I didnt have an awesome childhood, neither of my parents were people I could look up to. No role models. Im just so bad at life.

Right now Im studying in university for some kind of IT and security and I absolutly hate it. For the 5 days I havent understood a single world. So yeah, Im stupidnot judging just by the university, Ive always been like this, just sitting and dont understanding shit, also I got almost no social skills, I dont really like peoplejust kinda avoid them, Im not talented at anything, Im not skilled at anything and I dont like anything. Everything I do I hate, really hate. So yeah, right now Im in some kind of situation, where I dont really know what to do next. University is too hard for me, and I think I will drop out aftwr first exams because Im too stupid too understand this and hate this too much to force myself to study. I asked my friend about all this things and he told me some stuff like yo go find yrself, or yo, just do things. But it sounds stupid for me. Im so fcking tired of trying something, and then after investing time finding out that you suck at it, and also you suck at many many other thing aswell. I realise all those thing like that I need to try, because else I will never know, I need to talk to people e.t.c but I cant force myself to do it. Also I never had a girlfriend, and I dont think I ever will have one, because Im too uninteresting and unattractive to date me or even talk to me. I dont really look after myself because at this point I dont really care. And probably if I fail my exams at my university Ill just commit suicide, because I dont see a point in living anymore, I just need some kind of trigger to help me make that decision.

I was doing great all summer with a healthy diet, exercising, losing weight. Then my summer job ended. Now I spend the majority of my time watching show after show and mindlessly eating while I do it. Whenever im alone in the house and not distracting myself with food, tv, or porn I just end up pacing around, staring out the window melancholically like a antidepressant tv ad. Ive had a therapy consultation at my college where we primarily discussed my potentially having ADHD and my struggles with feeling guilty about my academic underperformance. I mightve gotten to talking about whether Im depressed, but I never actually had a session, they were booked until the end of the year.

Depression manifests as a variety of symptoms such as fatigue, insomnia, loss of energy, anxiety ,negative thinking, emotional numbness, loss of motivation...etc So far I found many ways to manage the symptoms of depression but I didnt find anything that helped with the numbness part where you just dont feel anything or care about anything at all nothing makes you happy, sad, cry, your mood is just flat all the time I wasnt always like this I was a normal person with hobbies, ambitions and goals but I developed this condition this year and it stripped me of everything. I lost all feelings for my gf I lost all drive for my dreams, they mattered nothing.

    "I depress my partner... My partner and I have been together for 11 years now. Were very much alike and most times, thats great. Except for one. We both suffer from depression. Different reasons sprouting from different childhood crap, but the end result is the same both of us lying in bed for a few days under the covers. The problem is, I think my partner is an emotional sponge, because it almost ALWAYS works out that I get depressed first and then he will too, just two days behind. Its gotten to the point that Im getting really intense anxiety over getting depressed myself because I dont want to do that to him. It feels like something Im inflicting on him and then leaving him out to dry cuz Im still screwed up. Im there for him when hes depressed, no question. But anyone who has had depression knows youre not 100 when in the middle of it, and it seems so unfair to me that hes the strong one for me but then doesnt get the same level of help when he goes under. Its like I get someone to lean on but then he only gets someone to wallow with. He says thats all he wants, just some company and reassurance. But its hard to really hear that I was raised by narcissists and its still hard to really accept that I dont have to be on top ofam not to blame for other peoples emotional state. I just want some advice on how to better deal with the anxious thoughts surrounding this so I dont feel like its something Im putting him through, or maybe just some general ideas of how to better be there for him when Im depressed too.

    "Advice on how to deal/make progress So, Im currently in a hole with my depression, and I could use some advice on what to do and ideas on how to approach things, as Ive done a lot already. Its a bit of a story, but I will keep it as brief as possible. If youre reading this and want to help, thanks in advance! So depression has been a thing all my life, but I only got a diagnosis around 10 years ago Im 33. I am also disabled, having a diagnosis of autism and suffering from chronic fatigue. I got therapy, and eventually, medication. The therapy CBTlike didnt really help, but at least talking to someone was nice at times I had a good therapist. The medication did help. I was put on 50mg sertraline. Fast forward a few years, and I start to do worse. I get sick with bowel pain that appears to be persistent. A few other difficult things in my life happen, and my depression starts coming back. The pain eventually becomes so hindering I have to stop work entirely. I get a pretty intense comprehensive therapy program for dealing with unexplained symptoms, and it is overwhelming. I lapse back into deep depression. The decision is made to up my dose to 100mg sertraline, and I climb out of it. The lessons I learn from therapy eventually help, and helps me control the pain and lessen it somewhat, although the fatigue actually intensifies. Fast forward to around now, covid times. Turns out, telling someone with a tendency for severe depression stay inside and have as little contact as possible is a recipe for bad times. I live in a place where I dont have a social network, a result of them moving away and me trying but so far being unable to because disability and dependency on social housing, which is a mess. So events were very important to me, and theyve all been canceled now for about a year and a half. I honestly do pretty well for around 10 months longer than I expected, before things get bad and I seek out my psych again. The decision is made to up my sertraline dose to 150mg, although I note I am seeing a pattern of it stopping working every 3 years.",

Just need some advicesupport, or whatever please, Im not really sure what I need, like I said, Im not in the best state of mind currently. ampx200B Ive skipped school maybe 56 times this year when things were too much, as school is one of my biggest stressors and I dont even see the point sometimes, just to get a mental break. Ive never done much on those days other than lie around, or maybe play some video games if I felt like it. These were the worst days for me, constant suicidal thoughts since my parents and brotherssister wouldnt be home, either at school or work. These are the days that I kept toying with the idea, feeling safe in a weird way, I know that I could kill myself if I needed to. I havent skipped for about a month or so, but all throughout yesterday I was thinking as I get closer and closer to graduation, theres a time limit of sorts on when Im actually going to go through with it, as it gets closer and closer I feel more pressure that I have to do it, because I feel like I need to kill myself before I graduate high school, Im not sure why. Today I woke up at 630, and as soon as I got up I was already battling with the idea of whether or not to go to school, and this thought stayed with me throughout breakfast, throughout my shower. I told my brother, who I normally walk to school with, that my alarm woke me up late and that hed better walk to school ahead of me if he didnt want to be late, so he left. I literally did nothing for the next 30 minutes to an hour, literally felt nothing, just thinking about what I was going to do.",

    "Unable to think clearly Like the title says, Im unable to think clearly. Its like the gears in my brain is covered with gunk and is just not moving smoothly. Ive been getting decent sleep, but Im tired regardless of how much sleep I get. Food is not an issue afaik. No alcohol in quite a while and Ive reduced how much caffeinated soda or any soda I drink because I was addicted to it. Im getting decent exercise too. But I just cant think well. Or concentrate for that matter. Thats the one thing Ive got, you know? My brain. Doing innovative things at work is one of the only things Im proud of and thats letting me down. And Im fucking nervous all the time. Its like theres something clutching me in my chest 247. I started therapy earlier this week. Ill express this in my next session, but if any of you have any suggestions, Im open to it. Thanks, everyone. Have a great day",
    "I lost my job and potentially my career due to a deep depression. Hello, I 27F am using my alternative account because there are people who are trying to hurt me with anything they can find out about me. I was diagnosed with Anxiety, depression, and Bipolar disorder at the age of 11 and have always struggled, but I functioned for the most part. A little over a year ago, I was in the darkest place of my life. My dad had just had a major heart attackstrokeaneurism and was destined to die according to doctors he beat the odds with months of comastherapy. My favorite aunt had committed suicide and left my two high school aged cousins motherless. Most terribly though, my ex had blindsided me and illegally started a child custody battle to take my only child, a 7 year old, away from me who I have raised his whole life. I spent all my personal investmentssavings, 15,000, to hire a top attorney and was left broke and completely shattered. My partner was there to support me as much as he could so my son an i had a roof over our head but i was suffering. Shortly before this all happened, I had completed my 1 year internship at a major Financial Firm amp had gained my Series 7 amp Series 66 FINRA licenses. I was so proud of my accomplishments, salary, and stability after 10 years of customer service and sales jobs that did not provide full stability. I was so happy, the happiest I had been in a long time, and then everything came crashing down at the same time. I had an amazingly supportive boss who helped me every step of the way until I exhausted my PTO, UTO, FMLA, Short Term Personal Leave and he had run out of options to offer me. During all this time, I was nothing but a husk. I wouldnt leave my bed, eat, shower, and I spent hours just sleeping. My partner didnt know what to do and Psychiatrist were unavailable due to a large shortage in my city over 6 month waits and up to 9 months. I refused to go to an inpatient facility because I knew it would hurt my child custody case but at the time, that probably would have been the best option. This went on for over 3 months.",
    "I need help *TW, self harm thoughts* Things have been stressful at home. My husband lost his job in the summer and neither one of us has been able to find a job. We were denied for government assistance, but my husband gets payment from the VA and unemployment. Because of this stress, my husband and I fight all the time. We love each other, its just so hard. I feel like if I told him about all this it would just add to his stress. Ive thought about putting myself on a psychiatric hold but I havent. I just dont know what to do anymore. I have nobody to talk to. I have a suicide diary in my phone. Ive attempted before when I was 16, so almost 10 years ago. I dont want to commit suicide, I just want something bad to happen to just me and I die. I know this is wrong and not a good sign, I know I need to see a therapist and get on more medicine but we have no insurance. I cant help but feel obnoxious, like a burden, unwanted, unloved, like Im just being used, like Im a terrible wife and mother. I even wrote in my suicide note that if Im ever found dead, to cremate me and throw me in the trash. I dont want to die necessarily because of my boys and my husband, I love them more than anything. I just cant help these thoughts and I feel terrible about it. And my husband has no idea, and neither do my boys. I just want to feel like Im enough, I guess. I dont even know if this makes sense. Thank you for reading.",
    "What should I try next? I have severe depression and anxiety. I am currently in a particularly bad episode. It is truly hellish and I can do very little. Between episodes I can be fairly high functioning, but I am finding that I am dilapidating more and more each year. Work and relationships are becoming increasingly impossible even during the good phases. I have tried psychotherapy ongoing still, CBT, DBT, citalopram, venlafaxine still in withdrawal, psilocybin therapy produced traumatising hell trips, diazepam, lorazepam, propranolol, zopiclone, exercise 5x per week, sleep, SAD lamps, meditation, good nutrition, prayer, selfharm, changing jobs, going back to education, selfhelp books, sauna, icebaths, living alone, living with friends, living with parents, float tanks, supplements and some other stuff. I have an ok job and live alone in an ok studio. Friends and family are generally supportive, although I have a poor, disconnected, awkward relationship with parents. No matter what, the good phases never feel that good and the horrifying, suicidal phases always keep returning. I think a lot of metacognition contributes a lot fear of what others are thinking about me especially partner and work colleagues, overthinking everything, regret and frustration about all these diseases are doing to me. If anyone has any ideas on what helps or maybe works for them, Id be interestedgrateful. I havent gone into a full description of my symptoms as dont want this to drag on too long, but am happy to answer any specific questions. Peace.",

    "At risk of losing the only thing I have left... Please help :( Sorry it's a long one I became a target for abuse from his family after we split up. ampx200B Fast forward to today My best friend and I have been a couple for just over a year. Things have been amazing until he moved here.. We both got a job in the same place, and I became massively stressed and depressed. The stress of everything changing hit me hard and I admit I stopped showing him any affection. I hate myself for it, we argued ALL the time. We lost our jobs due to some REAL shady stuff going on at work tax evasion, illegal activity etc and he told me he was moving back but not leaving me. ampx200B This is where I am now. Ive been back to my normal self the last few days, feeling more love for him than I ever have, wanting to show him... But I have just under 2 months to vacate our house. With little to no money in the bank and a daughter to look after. Its her birthday and wed planned a huge party ... 8 days before were due to leave. ampx200B If he leaves and Im on my own again, it WILL kill me. I cant lose this connection with him. I cant be on my own again. I cant stand the thought of not having him beside me every day, of spending the next gosh knows however many years only seeing him a few times a year, or only over Skype... ampx200B But if I move to Norway with him...

Im torn... and Im a mess. ampx200B Do I hurt my daughter in the short term... or do I just let myself die and be freed from this eternal struggle for good? Im fed up of fighting.

I really feel like I should do something to help but I cant seem too since she wont engage in conversation with me.

    "Should I kill myself? I am the most uninteresting person and I feel like I am the only one who puts effort into any of my relationships. But when we broke up, they were there for me. Though I hated myself for opening up to them, showing the weak side of myself, showing my insecurity, and once again depending on others for emotional stability is so unhealthy and unattractive. I cried infront of them, I told them about how I suffered with suicidal thoughts, I told them about my past and what I went through and they listened to me. I am grateful for that but I never should of told them a thing. 2020 happened and I began isolating myself, I attempted suicide once at the start. I tried reaching out to Angela, I didnt want to tell any of them about my issues any more but I wanted to distract myself and have someone to chat to. No response, the lack of effort I put in my friends finally came to haunt me. Once I got over my ex in march 2020, no one wanted to talk to me anymore. We werent able to see eachother at school and I didnt build that relationship where we can just text. We werent able to hangout so the friendships sort of rotted. I thought I was hopeless, friendless, and losing more prospects for the future. I dont have connections to be successful. I have nothing. So I though why not end it. I took a bunch of pills but I just ended up blacking out and puking a bunch. I remember the feeling of blacking out but I could still hear the voice of people freaking out as I was fading. I lost vision and feeling but I could still hear. I thought I was dead. But no I wasnt, I started therapy regularly. I was so hopeless and didnt know how to make friends but I kept pushing through. I tried reaching out a few times and sometimes they said hi back. I ended up hanging out with Angela once restrictions lifted a bit in the summer. But after that we struggled to talk again. My other 2 friends ended up dating and stopped talking to most people becsuse of that.",

I just... dont feel optimistic about my prospects anymore. I dont even care about the debt, I cant see myself ever buying a house and I cant even bring myself to imagine having a so and kids. All I want to do is go to bed and not move from under the covers... I dont know when this even happened.

    "I think I need help.(Long)(references self harm) Im not one to usually ask for help, im a high schooler now and for most of my life Ive been a suffer in silence person. However, a couple years ago, towards the end of 7th grade, I sort of began to withdraw myself from friends and family, and I basically started writing a journal in which I very heavily contemplated self harmsuicide. My parents found this and set me up with a counselor, who thinks I have majorclinical depression. She recommended I go to the doctor for very mild antidepressants, because she thought those could help. My doctor, though, didnt prescribe them. It feels like no one takes it seriously when I do talk about this? I did begin smoking weed in about 8th grade to help cope, but have began smoking a lot less once I did meet counseling. I should note that it did feel better over the summer between 7th and 8th grade, but hit full swing in 8th. Im in 9th now still feelin it, but my friends just sort of brush it off when I mention the possibility of self harmsadness. Im not really sure what to do with myself to be honest because no one seems to care, school counselors just told me to join clubs and no one really tries to help. People say I hope it gets better, dude! But it always seems fake. Could I get some advice please? ?",

Lastly, Ive always been very thin, as a male I still weighed around 120lbs ish. Now Im around 130, which I know is still nothing, and I dont think Im fat or anything like that, but Id never in my life gained weight, and suddenly I was 10 lbs heavier in a matter of a few months.

Today at dinner my mom finally lashed out over my lack of hygiene, its then that I realized I havent showered in months, nearly a year of sometimes washing my hair or just standing under the water every once in a while. I showered and it dawned on me that I, probably have depression. The mere realization made me cry more than Ive cried in years. I read all about seek help and tell your parents about it but Im kind of ashamed to admit it. Theyve given everything to provide for me and my sister, and Ive got all the ingredients for what Id assume is a normal and functioning life. It feels like I have no right to be feeling like this when theres people who have it much worse than me. Im posting it here because I need anonymous support. Im not yet ready to admit it out loud,but I think Im depressed. P. S If this is long, boring, or just hard to read please forgive me, Im not even sure if Im thinking straight and I just wrote down everything as fresh off my head as I could.",
    "Depressed International Student; need help I start working on something and feel it is totally pointless. I start watching youtube or the office to feel a bit better and suddenly it is 6 pm. I think that its already evening, maybe I should go out, get some fresh air. I go out, pickup a friend and smoke a cigarette or two my friend doesnt smoke. While coming back, I feel the day is almost over and I am basically useless, nothing will change if I get high. I go and buy some marijuana edible legal, eat it and go back home. I act like I am working while staying high, so my parents wont know. Many times, I just lie that I have a meeting and shut off my door, lie down and masturbate like twice or thrice in a day. As I get high, I also overeat and buy a lot of junk food and chocolates. Then, I spent the rest of the night till 23 am doing all this and watching office or Youtube. I feel totally exhausted and go to sleep. Then, I wake up next day exhausted at 10 and the cycle goes on. I also feel pretty dumb as I have almost no progress on my thesis. My professor thinks that I am smart but I am not. I just slack and slack and come up with some excuse for not doing the work. I just make some dumb and vague presentations an hour before the meeting. From last two weeks, I havent even done that. I just make some excuse and try to portray myself as the victim. I have one more semester left for my thesis and I think I should just quit. But I cant because then how will I pay for my loan. I am also not getting any internships, how the fuck am I supposed to get a job. I thought maybe Ill start a PhD degree as I am not really getting anything else and Ill at least get some stipend regularly if I get the scholarship. My chances of getting the scholarship are highly dependent on my honours thesis and I seem to be doing a very bad job till now. I have to submit a draft of a literature review on Monday rn its Saturday night which will be of around 15 pages and I havent even started yet.",
    "Dopamine dependent depression Hi everyone, I suffer from depression dependent on low dopamine levels. I have already tried the bupripion at 450mg but it hasnt worked except for a very short period. I have lived with this problem for years and if I dont find a solution I will evaluate euthanasia. the ssri do nothing but exacerbate my symptoms. I lost my job, I sleep all day because of poor physical and mental energy. I have chronic fatigue, cognitive difficulties , memory problem , difficulty concentrating. I have lost libido. I dont have any other type of pathology or deficiency, I dont have hormonal, thyroid, autoimmune, inflammatory problems. I have already tried reboxetine, moclobemide, tranylcypromine, citalopram, escitalopram, venlafaxine, amisulpride, tianeptine, modafinil, sulbutiamine, bupropion, vortioxetine, sertraline, piracetam, aniracetam. modafinil I had to stop it because it caused me heart problems. what the heck should i use to increase dopamine? I have absolutely no intention of using cocaine or amphetamine i dont want to destroy my brain more . help me damn it",
    "Should I get myself checked in to a psychiatric ward so they can force me to start my antidepressant? The more scared I get the worse my anxiety gets. The worse my anxiety gets the more I get scared, and it gets even harder to start my medicine. Lately I havent been able to think about anything else other than my bowel issues, I cant even watch a youtube video. Im not suicidal I have suicidal thoughts yes but I havent made any plans, and I have things I want to do, you know? I dropped out of college, and I want to go back. Im not even exaggerating when I say this I see myself going back to school literally every night in my dreams. I have gender dysphoria, and I want to at least know how it feels like to be comfortable in your own body. And these things keep me going. But I also know that I have to take my medicine, and I just dont know how I can do that. I thought of a couple things that I can try. First, I can get myself checked in to a psychiatric ward. Make them force me to take my medicine. There are several upsides and downsides with that. If I get an anxiety attack they can intervene. I will be forced to take the medicine, so it has a higher probability of success. But on the other hand, the psychiatric wards in my country have some problems. Ive read a lot about human rights violations, abuse, mistreatment, violence etc. And Im sure you can understand, I dont need this stuff on top of my problems. Also since Im not a danger to myself or to others they might not even accept me. Also my parents will probably be very angry with me, because I dont look very nervous or stressed from outside. Second, find a way to start taking them on my own. I can ask to start from a lower dose. My psych wanted me to start at 150mg. Effexor XR is available with dosages as low as 37.5mg. I can ask for anti anxiety medication. I have anti nausea medication, and I can take that while starting.",
    "Is it possible to date if I'm depressed? Ive been diagnosed in the end of 2018, but I honestly cant remember a time in my life where I havent been sad although it gets better at times. So I recently started dating my best friend and its been all good. Hes really understanding, supportive, has been there for me in my darkest times and things happened so naturally for us that it just felt right. But sometimes, I cant feel things as intensely as him and that makes me feel really bad. Like, I know I love him but there are days where I just cant find the motivation to do anything and it feels like my feelings get kinda blocked, so when he starts being affectionate towards me or something, Im just there like... yeah. We have talked about this a few times, but sometimes Im afraid Ill never feel things again and itll get impossible for us to handle and I really dont wanna be a burden for him. What do I do???? ?",
    "Finding the right psychologist I was seeing one who was great for the first 3 years and then started really pushing CBT and mindfulness onto me, despite me saying multiple times I hate both of those approaches and they dont work for me. I havent seen anyone since December and I think I need to. Im going downhill again. How do I bring it up that Im not doing CBT, mindfulness and homework sheets. My GP offered to write a letter to my old psychologist explaining all that, but my anxiety is too high to go back and be questioned about it. I hate all of this. So much.",
    "Could you read me? I consent to him so anal sex with me. When the violence was over and started the sex it was awful. It was the most unsatisfying experience Ive ever had. I couldnt believed what I just did. I just ruined the only healthy male relationship that I had for a disgusting experience. I still didnt remembered what happened with my brother, but I tried to repress this memory as well. I wasnt successful. ampx200B Me, at 16, didnt saw any good thing in life anymore, and the memory of the sex that I had with my cousin was still in my mind. In therapy, I accepted that experience but it just seemed that something was wrong. Of course, it was around my whole life so it was very obvious Im gay. Right, Im gay. Mom Im gay. Dad, Im gay. World, IM GAY. Now Im gonna be happy. Except that I wasnt. So I decided Im just gonna be happy when I kiss a man. I kissed. Three. And I hated. Once I kissed a girl, but she humiliated me in front of the whole class and said that was the worse kiss ever. The other girl I was interested rejected me totally. So I just said you what, Im gay. I dont fucking care. I surrounded myself with gay people, feeling that I would feel part of something for the first time. I didnt. I wasnt interested in any man, except the ones that treated me badly and bullied me. Those one were straight. ampx200B I lived for two years as a gay man, that has never felt so unhappy in my life. Empty. The memory of what happened to me and my brother started to rise inside my head. But neglected it and just said its normal, boys do that. It was until the last year. when I was making coffee. I accidentally let it fall in my brothers body and, of course, he started screaming with me. At that moment, I just cried like never before. Since I was 10 I didnt cried.",
    "Ex GF was my life, now what's the point? I posted my story on another sub for some support. Feel free to read itits long. I am just feeling very depressed today. Depressed being an understatement. She was my world. We were going to get married and have a life together. Had our kids name picked out. She told me she couldnt imagine her life without me. Now shes posting pictures with the guy she cheated on me and left me for saying how amazing he is. Hes a loser, no job, no education, cant support her. I would have given her the world.

    "Depression after my scoliosis surgery Hello everyone, Ive had a surgery on 10th of February, since my scoliosis reached about 60. I was happy I was getting the surgery at first, seeing it as an investment in the future. Without it, I would have experienced extreme pain in later stages of my life. However, after i woke up from the surgery Ive been hit with nightmarish pain, unable to sleep for almost two days. Since then, Ive been worried if I have made the right decision. Hearing nurses say that people are recovering after just three days got me really sad, as i can barely move around in my bed without major pain. Im feeling really desperate, as if there is no escaping from the pain, as I feel plenty of it even under hospital medications. I had a friend that underwent the very same surgery, i looked up to her as she was able to live easily with it, as if she never was on a surgery. Unfortunately, I fucked up our friendship because I was a dick. I greatly regret it since now i see what she had to go through and how strong she was. Now I have no one to reach out too about this. If someone has any experience with a scoliosis surgery or can help, please do Thank you",

    "What should I be doing to get out of this..I am a solo warrior and I am sure I can beat it. I am slipping into a very dangerous world again where I am kind of staying alone and having recurrent episodes of going to my dreaded balcony. I am coping by taking a shot of diazepam and whisky. Its gone to the point that now I can barely sleep in a week easily for more than 4 hours a night and I am constantly fighting people all around. If I dont have someone around I get delusional that I am at fault and this constant selfloathing and a sense of not having done enough is driving me crazy to the point that I think I am worthless. I am also professionally undergoing a transition to a new role and in between, I fought with a lot of my close buds and a couple of my relatives and this is now showing on my face and I can barely smile now. This is a sad state of affairs and I am now seeking professional counselling online with people who have undergone this. I think I fucked up quite bad this time and I really need someone to talk to. Friends who I thought would understand have kind of given up on my constant emotional outbursts and I have now shut myself in. I had a really rough start to this year and things have been very bad at home and I have been all solo on this and I have got myself into situations where I have been super drunk and tried to OD on any tablet I could find. Strangely in my office environment, I come across as pretty normal but sadly . I dont know this is so fuckin messed up that now I cant even reach out to anyone at home and here in this foreign country. What is my best action plan? Any ideasno I dont want to go to doc as this is just 16 days to pass before I go back to my home country and I am kind of reserved to again open up. Meditation doesnt help. I am also having random episodes of night terrors and recently I have started drifting into a weird halo.. I have even called one of my friends to come over and he doesnt have any idea whats happening for 4 days just to have someone around to ensure I dont fuck up anything.",
    "Should I kill myself? I am the most uninteresting person and I feel like I am the only one who puts effort into any of my relationships. I actually am in a relationship though, we started dating in april. Its a ldr though, and her timezone is 14 hours ahead. It was pure infatuation at the start, we both felt so confident about the relationship. She had plans to move to the same city as me, we had so much in common. We were both sort of shy and laid back. Though as I got more comfortable my extroverted side came out. I think I smoothered her too much though, I always complimented her and tried to tell her itll be okay and I am eilling to wait for borders to lift to meet her. She liked it so I kept doing it, but I think the repetitiveness, lack of physical touch, and my neediness eventually became unattractive. It became the norm. I was always there for her when she needed to talk, and we kept talking about how we are going to meet as soon as borders go up. It was hard to keep interesting and we didnt know what else to do. Then in the last month, things started getting hard for me at work and in my family, I opened up about insecurities about my mom health as she was diagnosed with cancer, and how I feel I have to work on my confidence. I think this must have really been a turn off. She has become more and more distant this past month. She still says shes into me but she doesnt talk about the future as much and is not nearly as affectionate as before. She has said she doesnt know how much longer she can do ldr, but shes willing to keep trying a little longer for me. But it feels like she isnt putting any effort and idk, the relationship doesnt feel secure and loving anymore. I talked to her about it and she said she really likes me, but she feels so distant. Idk what I can do to help this or if theres anything. I really like her, like we never fought, and we really matched. I loved gsming with her, or playing piano for her.",
    "Is helping / giving money to a depressed friend, no matter the amount, helpful at all? My friend says shes stuck paying off loans for college tuition as well as rentgroceries and such. Im not entirely sure what to do or say when she brings it up, which sucks for her. I know she is close with her mom and such and she hasnt said how it really affected her but Im tempted to give her some gift card for her closest food joint or would cash be okay, but I fear it would be seen as pity? I care about my friend very much and I dont know how often she tells or asks people for things but she hasnt asked me for help, just told me of her struggles. Would it be ok to offer such a thing?

    "Ungluing myself from my bed Im someone who spends around 16 hours a days on my bed. I sleep there, sometimes eat there, sometimes study there, most things I do are done on the bed. Whats important is it needs to be seen as a place of sleep, and it limits what I do. I want to be asleep and awake at sensible times. I unhealthily use my phone in my bed for things I probably find boring, like a zombie, too the point where I still use it when I get tired. I want to make sitting down attractive, or standing attractive, or walking attractive, or I want to make living on my bed feel unattractive. I do have ideas on how, but Id like to hear other peoples ideas and thoughts. In my room is my desk and chair, my bed, and my floor. I also have sofas in my shared kitchen, with a TV, and 3 flatmates, though Im hesitant to interact with them. And, I obviously have the outside world. The things Ive tried is buying a cushion for my chair, and using one of those hand resistance things thats just a tool for fiddling that cant really be conveniently used in bed while on my phone. I was thinking of getting some PC games that Id be able to run smoothly on my lowperforming laptop, or investing in a Nintendo Switch, as I know that Im spending most of my freetime doing things I dont find enjoyable and I like playing Smash Ultimate.

    "Letting my boyfriend commit suicide. Please help. Throwaway because he knows my main. My boyfriend wants more than anything to commit suicide. Ive never met someone so sure of anything before. It comes off that way at least. Its not a cry for help, its not for attention, and its not a bluff. Im 100 positive. I try to offer support, solutions, and my love but it makes no difference. I know I have to respect his wishes because ultimately were both prochoice, and I dont want him in pain anymore. I cant handle this reality though. Im in so much pain, and I dont have any support. I love him so much. He says that if I love him, Ill let him go... Please help me...please. Ive had 247 derealization for 4 years now. I also have BPD. I cannot process the my emotions when I think about him dying or when we are talking about it Im the one who asks to talk about it especially if he says something like I despise life or I just want to be done while hes frustrated  and he reluctantly does just a little bit. I go into a very confused state really, I feel a level of confusion most all of the time where my feelings are so overwhelming that I feel like I need to claw my brain out or just hang myself right there. I try not to show this in front of him, but I have had some horrible panic attacks after our conversations. I know this just stresses him out more, and I feel awful about it. I have a SEVERE death phobia. Its always on my mind, and it makes it extremely hard to function daytoday. I have constant intrusive thoughts about bad afterlife scenarios.

    "I've been feeling this way for some tine Im alway feeling like this. It doesnt even matter the age we are anymore. When we are feeling low its just that. Ive been dealing with depressionanxiety since I was 1213. It comes with just a long story that I was never able to overcome it. I tried to seek help and when she tried to suggest medication since I was already angry I just never went back. I just got to a point where I just say Im ok when asked HOW ARE YOU? Its just easier to say Im ok, than explaining how I feel. night time is the worst for me since Im alone in my room. Ive tried to text people that I was once able to do, but that turned out wrong for me so I guess I dont have that option anymore. Ive done things in the past where I am trying to avoid but as selfish as that may sound to others I found my comfort in that. I dont want to do that anymore. Finally admitted to myself that I cannot do this anymore by myself. This whole year has been a night mare for me but I still tried and I feel like kept falling deeper and deeper. Like being in a coma but with my eyes open. Like being in a crowded room and yet Im still feeling alone, boxed in, no way out. Ive become so afraid of being alone, that I am alone. Lost valuable friends, a great partner and I cannot get any of it back. I held back on telling people how I feel with the fear of losing anyone else.

Dont know why or where this all came from but its been even harder to get myself together. Maybe I deserve to be alone. I deserve to not have you as my friend.",

Things were complicated with current relationships but we knew it was going to be tough and I was willing to give her the world and totally shake mine up for it. At some point something changed. Extreme feelings of happiness to guilt, settling, lack of confidence in the situation and shutting it out. Now I am left feeling not good enough. I knew in the back of my mind I wasnt going to be but was always told otherwise. It felt like the most amazing dream. It was shattered. I dont know why but now I am left feeling a shell of what was being built up. I feel used and betrayed. It has been extremely hard to open up about the situation. I am very private and so is she. I just feel completely devastated and being now totally cut off from even a friendship I feel like someone died and its all my fault. I opened my heart and mind and they are left in tatters.

    "I'm alone. Im lost. Im afraid. Im worthless. I have no one in my life anymore, bar one friend who lives on the opposite side of the world. I lost my boyfriend yesterday. He broke up with me because my depression was bringing him down. I understand, I guess, but the last thing I could ever have wanted or needed was my boyfriend to leave me, he was my rock, and he cheered me up even on my worst days. I have no family. They never wanted much to do with me, especially when I started developing mental health issues 8 years ago. They slowly but surely made their way out of my life and upset me in the most awful ways. I have no friends. I moved into university and left my friends at home, and I really struggled to make new friends here. I have one, my flatmate, but thats it, no one else wants anything to do with me. Im even considering moving back home to a mother who really dislikes me and made my life a living hell, I cant stay here at uni. I have no one left. I have no reason to live anymore. Ive fought for so long, and surprisingly, I think I can say Im currently at the lowest part of my life, and I have gone through and done a tonne of shit. I dont know what to do anymore.",
    "puberty? attention? depression? hello i am a teen who is going through puberty right now which is why i dont know if Im even depressed or what, if i am, then am i just seeking attention? everytime i think to myself that i might have depression, it just hits me that this is just puberty, im just seeking attention and whatnot, i feel really unhappy, i started wanting to eat less, wary of my weight i am very selfconscious and I cant sleep without using my phone to sleep, i feel like im such a failure to my parents who are trying to raise me with their best, i always tried my best to be a good child to them, not doing what they didnt want, but i felt like i suddenly changed, i didnt want to be a good kid anymore, following all the rules and having to hide whats not good within me, i just wanted to be who i am without trying to hide it from them like its such a crime, but I cant because im too afraid, i want to be honest with them and relieve this feeling off my chest but I cant, i always think theyll probably think that im just wanting attention, I dont want to be ashamed, i dont like the feeling of embarrassment, i just want to be alone, away from everything but i want to talk at the same time, its just that i always rethink it, when i think of talking with someone, my mind just rethinks everything and i eventually end up not talking with someone, so i wanted to talk here, with more responsible people than me I could also be probably just too self conscious, I dont know, im doubting myself with everything i think which could be the reason, making me not come up with an answer, Ive also been feeling empty for a very long time, i could laugh and be happy at times but it doesnt feel right, like theres something missing, i dont have any traumas that i can remember to be a source, im an introvert who dislikes social interaction and is comfortable isolated, i have thanatophobia which I dont remember having a trauma of either but i suddenly get panic attacks as if im being choked and my brain just goes blank, which i havent told my parents about either but i had a panic attack before in front of them which probably just seemed like i was just feeling unwell or something to them i think, i only remember it vaguely which is why i dont really remember what happened but I do remember them being passive about it ?, considering everything was completely normal and i dont remember them asking me why i acted like that, and right now as im typing, i feel like im making my parents look shitty even if theyre not and i know they dont deserve it and im just rambling stupidly like this but i felt like i just had to open up everything i hadnt told them since i developed bottling up my feelings instead of talking im probably better gone, but i dont want to leave my parents am i depressed or just over reacting?",

Im stuck at home, mostly in my bed cause I got injured. I cant feel happy anymore it seems. My antidepressants stopped doing anything and its just crippling sadness and pain and Ive started contemplating suicide and self harming again. Im not sure what to do anymore.

    "“I Don’t Care What You Think… This Is Between Me And God Now.” I have always looked up to my older cousin, Jim. He was truly one of the three men I admire most credit Don McLeans American Pie. And then, as if my current struggles with depression havent been bad enough, this week he tore me apart over a situation that he was completely ignorant about. He took one persons totally distorted version of events a diplomatic way of saying that he believed someone elses delusional lies and wouldnt even consider my side of the story. I tried so hard to get him to understand what I was doing and why. But he just wouldnt listen and continued to so very unfairly condemn me. Jim hurt me so badly. And he broke my heart. I was at a loss for what to do next. Then I thought about what my Dad would say in a similar situation. He wasnt a very big man physically, but he was one tough little SOB. And though he passed three years ago, I still find comfort and inspiration from his words of wisdom. So I told Jim that Ive given this situation a great deal of thought and prayer. Im doing what I believe is right. And if he doesnt like it, with all due respect, I dont care. This is between me and God now. Jim had no answer. And his abusive attacks stopped. Thanks Dad. I love you, man. And I miss you",

    "My Government won't support my parents any longer for having me Disclaimers Never posted on reddit before, but I dont know who else to talk to. The grammar will be off because I am quite upset as I type this, my apologies. Quick backstory Ive suffered from depression ever since I was around 16, now Im soontobe 25. I tried seeing a therapist back when I was 18 and started university. She was truly awful and I thought I had no right to see a therapist. Fast forward to january 2019, I decided to try another therapist because I am truly incapable of living in this state. I still havent finished university. Im trying but failing. Im incapable of doing most tasks, let alone focus on studying. Although I have a job I dont get paid much. I depend on my parents who try to support me, but soon wont have the governments support because Im too old to count as a child. I just found out and I feel aweful. I never wanted to be a burden to my parents. Theyre not made of money, and although my mom said she wont kick me out, I know shes growing impatient. Shes having a difficult time understanding me anyways and this will only make it so much harder. I struggle very hard not to let the thought of ending it all so theyll be better of take over. Because I know my mom wont be better of knowing Ive commited suicide. I dont want to die. I just cant live. Does anyone on this reddit know how to deal with this? I should talk to my therapist about this, I know. But my next session wont be for another 2 weeks.",

    "A cry for help I live with abusive parents. Im 18, but unable to move out because the Covid situation is really bad in my country. Honestly all my hopes of staying alive were latched on to the fact that Id be able to move out by the end of 2020. But things have been so bad, quarantine has given my parents the right to basically keep me under lock and key under the farce of protecting me. Theyve broken the locks to the door of my room, and often my father is physically abusive. Both my parents are emotionally abusive. Every time my father is done beating me up, for months nobody in my family talks to me. Ive suffered from a complete mental breakdown, for a period of time I believed I was dead. I called a child helpline but I chickened out when they said theyd come over to my house to help me out. I talked to my school counsellor and she made me apologise to my parents for disrespecting them enough to call a helpline against them. I genuinely cannot do this anymore. I havent slept at night for weeks on end. Every time I try to sleep, I wake up suddenly and am unable to sleep again. I wrote down a suicide note yesterday. I made a reddit account today because Ive the tiniest bit of hope left. Ive studied so hard all my life just so Id take a Student Loan and move out for a good college, but all of that has fallen through. All my life, one hope sustained me, but now thats gone, Im basically living as a prisoner. I wish even a single person would believe me. It might save my life. Please.

    "What does it take to get better? I guess this is just me bitching about life. I understand you have to put in the work for it to get better. But nobody says what that work entails. Sometimes I wish I had a step by step process of what to do to stop feeling this way. This way feeling like Im not good enough. Logically I know I have a lot going for me and for the first time in my life I feel somewhat content and excited for the future. But my self worth still depends on LOVE. I hate that. I really want to feel happiness inside myself. And I do have things i love about myself. Im a good writer, ambitious, resourceful, conventionally attractive I guess but I enjoy my soul more than my looks. Still, I cant help but think I am worthless and pathetic and that if I dont marry before the age of 25 no man will want me. I also spent a lot of time in theredpill which maybe contributes to this way of thinking. I have traditional values and hate that this generation is so into the hookup culture that perpetuates feeling used up as a way of empowerment. If it makes you happy then more power to you I wish I could have meaningless sex and feel some form of enjoyment. But when all men have ever wanted me for is my body it makes me question if theres any good ones left. Logically i know there must be, by how do I stop attracting the bad ones and more importantly love myself instead?",
    "Exercising and sadness Hi im new here, last year i tried to end my life around this date and the support equip at the hospital told me to exercise regularly to help with the sadness, since i wasnt diagnosed depression or nothing really, just very sad. This is important becuse no one told me that before. And since then i tried to be more active, got a bike thanks to a job with my aunt and started walking for playing pokemon go again etc. But whenever i stop those activities i feel very low and sad, even if i do it just because im busy, but i have to admit sometimes i feel very lazy and tired to do them. Is there a connection between exercise and feeling happier? Can i find a way to be more excited about doing them alonewith friends? If this post needs another flair i can edit it",
    "I’m tired of pushing forward. When my wife came home she seemed concerned but didnt really know how to react. She sort of pushed me away and told me to sleep it off. In the morning I wasnt any better and I didnt have the energy to get out of bed. My wife called my mother to come help and she did a decent job of making me feel better but I felt embarrassed about it. After she left I was disappointed that my wife wouldnt hug and just sit with me and instead just push for me to be back to normal. After this incident I definitely havent been as open about my thoughts because I know she doesnt really care or rather doesnt know what to do. I have noticed that recently when we argue I will have moments where I want to react in self harm. This comes usually around the time when my wife and I go into a the quiet part of our argument when everything has already been said but we havent come to a resolution yet. In both in a state of calm anger. In this time I always want to bang my head against to wall or take a kitchen knife to my arm. In the past I would tell my wife about these thoughts but it came across as me trying to manipulate her by threatening self harm so I know not to bring it up anymore. At this point I feel like Im in a downward spiral. I want to go back to when I put care into myself. When I gave my all every day. Now I feel like an empty shell pretending to live a happy life. By now both my mom and sister know its a facade but I cant admit to it. I was able to power through it and make my wife and son my reason to live, not just an excuse , but a real reason to push forward but now I feel like Ive lost steam. What can I do to help myself?

    "Advice on personal hygiene/self care Hi everyone! This is my first post on reddit so please forgive me if I dont do this right p Ive struggled with severe depression for about 12 years or so now, and lately it seems to be getting worse. Its gotten to a point where I dont have motivation to do the most basic of things  such as showering daily, brushing my hair, even brushing my teeth... its incredibly embarrassing, but I just cant find it in myself to care. I used to put a lot of effort into my appearance, and I took pride in how I presented myself. Now though, I feel as if its pointless. I feel like the way I present myself currently is an accurate portrayal of how I feel inside. Does anyone have any advice on how to change this, or how to find motivation, or anything at all? Id greatly appreciate any ideas on how I could improve on this. I feel ashamed when I show up to work in the same outfit, or with my hair in a tangled bun because I couldnt be bothered to brush it. Not ashamed enough to change though, I guess. Thank you in advance for any responses, and thank you for taking the time to read this",
    "21 male, in post-relationship, feeling awful. Hello friends, Ive been thinking recently I need to talk about whats going on. I feel like my family members have heard enough of it and they dont really give me the answers or ease that I need. I loved a girl, and she loved me. She had always been dealing with mental health issues. She acted in ways she expected Id want to facilitate the relationship. In more blunt words, she had sex with me because she knew I wanted it even though it wasnt enjoyable for her. When the issue became clear, and the distance between us bolstered, I became restless. It seemed to me she had stopped loving me. I begged her to get help for the issues, but they were so deeply connected to her life that she was hurt that I would suggest the she could overcome them. We eventually broke up. I dont think either of us stopped loving the other. She hates me now, thinks Im some kind of asshole liferuiner. All I ever wanted was for her to be happy. It was trauma and sadness preventing her from being happy, and no matter how hard I tried, I could not help her. That was months ago now. I started to distance myself from it all. But I still have dreams of holding her and telling her I miss her. Yesterday, it came back with a vengeance. I cried and pained, looked at her social media, seeing directed passiveaggressive posts. It was really painful. I shouldnt have done it. So I need support. Should I just be pushing through this and moving on? Some part of me wants to fix it and love her again, but I know that wouldnt be good probably. And I know that if I was back with her, I wouldnt feel the love that I am searching for. It just hurts. I dont know how to feel. I just wish I could forget. Any support and advice would be amazing. Just to know that somebody out there recognizes Im not the bad guy, I wanted her to be happy. But my own needs became my care, and I stopped supporting a person I love because of sex.",

But I just have no idea what to do with these feelings or thoughts and quite frankly I dont want to be alive all that much. Im young, 17 and my life so far hasnt been as hard as some peoples but its not been the best and this last 2 years especially have been shit. Constant battle with what Im thinking could be adhd, ocd, anxiety and depression although Im not diagnosed so im taking most of these titles with a grain of salt until I do It makes me wonder if all of my adult hood is going to be shit too, I cant quite imagine myself as the happy version of me I used to be, especially going forward. I see nothing beginning to help me. Ive tried substances and techniques and they dont help. Other than weekly therapy and being doped up on some meds I dont see any other options.

There literally are not enough hours in a week for that to work, and thats not even accounting for the money I dont have that it would cost me. It doesnt make any sense.

This is the first time I write about my inner feelings, especially at these times outer war with Hamas in Gaza, and inner war with farright IsraeliArabs and Farright Jews. Im a happy person. Got a good job, great and supportive partner. I love living, curious on everything life has to offer. from baking, coffee, to movies and games, to travel and cultures around the world. Im keeping myself healthy with vitamins and doing Tim Ferriss 4 Hour Body diet and exercises. Not watching too much public television and getting some news oncetwice a day. Every day Im working from 9 to 6, ending with some different relaxation daily. For the last week, everything around me is changing. It has started with the famous issues in Jerusalem, and later started to go south. Sirens went off every evening, and woke us up every night between 1am and 3am, and also 7pm and 9pm. With every siren, we have 130min to get to a safe area. In that safe area, Im meeting every neighbor that lives around me, some elderly, some couples, and young families, which the mothers are crying out loud from the pressure. Once 130min have passed, we wait for the missiles to get hit by our irondome, or unfortunately fall. Yesterday one missile hit 5 kilometers from me. While this missiles and hits in Gaza is going on  inside the country, in cities where Arabs and Jews living together  theres literally an anarchy. If you look like a jew, orthodox mostly  youll get hit, kicked, and now will be shot. If you look like an arab, youll get hit, kicked, and probably be shot. There was not enough police to keep the area cool. Small groups in their hundreds, are traveling to these cities to protect their people. Jews, Arabs, it doesnt matter. synagogues burnt down, people being pull over and being hit by rocks. You need to identify in front of gangs if you are an arab or a jew. Either  youll be in grave danger. It needs ti be called a civil war non the less.",

    "16 year old struggling with depression and drugs Hey guys, Im 16 years old and I have had alcohol a few times, and it used to be somewhat of a problem for me. When I was 15, I only had alcohol about once a month, but I always fantasized about it, and when I had it, I tried to have a lot. I was really really depressed back then, and I have tons of selfharm scars and a few suicide attempts. And now, Ive gotten extremely depressed again. My exbest friend really victimized herself and said terrible things to me, stuff like that our whole friendship was based on lies and that Ive hurt her in ways that she couldnt imagine. This is due to lies that her abusive boyfriend had been feeding her, and he is a really bad person and talks trash about her so much and spills her secrets and doesnt have morals. I snapped when she was saying some really hurtful stuff to me and I told her everything her boyfriend did, which I think led to her saying those even more mean things to me. She ended up basically blocking me on everything. I went to a party yesterday and she was there and I felt so disconnected and lonely, and I vaped for the first time in a while, and there was a box cutter and I went to the bathroom to cut myself and I just felt so much better. Ive also been fantasizing about alcohol so that I could stop feeling. i have tons of goals for college and life, and I dont want to sound stuck up but I have pretty good chances at a top 10 college if I keep what I have going. But this has really clouded me, that someone who knew so much about me just rejected me like that and treated me like that and I just want to stop feeling. Does anybody have any advice? P. S. I promise that I wont be pming anyone to stop me from harming myself or anything like that. I would really appreciate real, actionable steps that can help me just forget about this situation and go back to working hard. For example, Ive heard that meditation could be really beneficial, and has anyone here tried it?",
    "I haven’t been happy in so long I look up how to get out of bed all the time. I see sit up as the first step but when I wake up in the mornings I dont want to feel better. I just want to go back to sleep. I sleep all day. I dont have a job and I know my boyfriend is being affected. I feel like a parasite on everyones life. No one benefits from being my friend or being with me. Im literally just a burden. Some of my best friends have even blocked me on social media and honestly Im not even mad. I understand. I take my anti depressants, Ive been to inpatient hospitals. I literally have no motivation to keep going. I dont want to die but I dont want to wake up anymore. I just want to lay in bed. I have a son. Even though I have no job, he goes to a babysitter. I only watch him twice a week. I love him and I miss him when hes gone but I can barely even take care of him when hes home. I know hes going to grow up to resent me. I wish I was the same person that gave birth to him but I am completely different. Hes such a good kid. Hes so happy I wish I could be a good mom for him. I wish I could be who my family needs me to be. I hate myself. I am terrible for my family. Most of the time I think that staying around is going to be worse for my family than if I just left. I dont know what to do. I want to be happy but Ive tried so many times to heal and the attempts have never gained any happiness.",

    "I don't know why I feel this way I pulled out my notepad and no words come out of me. I tried putting myself in front of my piano, but I cant bring myself to even play a full piece. The one that Ive tried is mediocre at best. I cant pick up a book. I cant bring myself to enjoy the foods I eat. I dont even know why I feel this way. There is no reason for me to feel this way. I have a roof over my head, a loving family, and supportive friends, yet why do I feel this way? There are people that say they love and care for me, but why cant I bring myself to pull up the phone to say Hi? I know theyd reply back, but I dont know why I cant do it. There is a voice in my head that says they hate you. They never cared for you. They only tolerate you because they see you as a sad being. I know its not true, but why does my mind work against me? And now, Im lying on my bed. I dont even want to do anything. I just want to lie down and try to sleep. I cant even do sleeping right. Sometimes, I sleep too much. Sometimes, none at all. And all I could do to shut my thoughts to play is some mindless video or song. But I never really enjoy it. The saddest thing for me is... I thought I already survived it. Ive been out of my medications for two years now, and yet, here it comes again. I dont like feeling this way. What does it feel like to not have a noisy brain that feeds me with depressive thoughts? Its like every waking moment of my life, it has something to say. And I hate it. I just want to feel genuine happiness again.",
    "I’m lonely and depressed So I was off on a youth volunteer program, located across the country. We would have been traveling to a second place, which didnt happen. I was in a house with 10 youth from around Canada, who started off as strangers. We were living together for 2 12 months before we were sent home, which was halfway through the programme. I met some of my best friends. We have plans in over a year to do a road trip across the country. But I wont see them until then, as we live so far apart from each other. I loved the time we all had together. There were ups and downs, but I got a lot from the experience. Im generally quite shy, so it was amazing to be surrounded by people, socializing 247. I definitely came out of my shell. We would stay up late, and all sleep in the same room. We would wake up, and have breakfast together. Anytime I felt like going out for a walk, I always had friends around to join me. We smoked weed many nights together, watched movies, and made food late at night. It was what I always felt like I was missing, not having any siblings who I had this relationship with. Anytime I was feeling a bit off, my friends were there to talk to me about it. Also, I was independent. I could do what I wanted and be who I wanted to be. I wasnt being told by my parents how to behave, or being judged by a group of friends from home who I act a certain way around. I came into the programme as myself, and only myself. I didnt have to act a certain way to fit in with a group of friends, or act a certain way at home to please my parents. Dont get me wrong, I love my parents. But Im at the time of my life 17M, btw where I want that freedom. I want to explore who I can be. We were supposed to travel other places, and fly to a different part of the country to spend the second half of the trip. Then we got quarantined. Then we were sent home.",
    "I want to get help but I'm scared of having a diagnosis on my record. So Ive finally hit the point where I think I might need to get help professionally, in the form of seeing a psychiatrist or therapist or whatever. My issue is that Im paranoid of having any sort of mental health diagnosis on my medical record. What are the pros and cons of this? The first thing I can think of is the fact that I own a decent amount of guns Im not suicidal, theres no reason it would be unsafe for me to own them and Im worried they may take them please leave personal politics out of that issue. Other than that its mainly just being scared of whatever, if anything, Im diagnosed with following me around on my record. Any one offer any insight? Im torn between wanting to get better and just leaving well enough alone.",
    "I don't know how to get a job that suits me I have a degree from a long time ago and Id like to use it. But every job description is fucking intimidating. It lists all these requirements and job descriptions and I dont know if I can do all that. I understand that the job would train you a bit and not just leave you out to dry. But when I read the job description the image in my head is of a hard diligent worker that shows up at 7am sharp and works through the entire day until 3pm with not a second wasted. Laser focused for the entire day. Or that I just wouldnt be able to pick up the job and perform well enough. Im scared as fuck.

    "I have a problem with getting mental help. My parents are a bit off. If their friend or a family member needs help, they will put their entire life on hold. But if their kids need help, its rarely done. Ive tried for months to get them to make a few doctors appointments. Specifically my psychiatrist. But no matter how many times I ask, it never gets done. In fact, about six months ago, I went to the dentist to get some cavities filled. I had cavities on the top and bottom sets, so, they said that we would have to come to two separate appointments to properly get them filled. Well, we went for the top set, and Ive asked my parents to schedule the second appointment ever since. However, my main concern is going to a psychiatrist. Mainly because for about two and a half years now, Ive had problems with the way my brain functions, and my grasp on reality. I just havent felt right. But in that time, I never considered going to a psychiatrist because i had been to one before, and they did prescribe me medication, so I thought that if there was something wrong, they would have found it years prior. But i spoke with some friends about it and they told me it would be smart to go back. That was a few months ago and I havent been able to convince my parents that I should go back. Its not a financial issue, my insurance covers everything And its not a time issue, neither of my parents are working. My parents are the There aint nothing you cant fix yourself type, and dont understand much about mental help. Its getting so bad that my mother wont hardly talk to anyone because shes either too lazy, to too buried in some kind of device to do anything. Then, when I ask my aunt or grandparents for help, my parents get pissed and complain about how I make them look bad. Dont get it wrong though, they are great in most other regards, but when it comes to me actually needing help, they really dont do much. When it comes to real responsibilities, they are just all around lazy. If anything cant be solved within a minute or two, they wont hardly even look in its direction.",

My heads talking, dreaming and analyzing all the time, my memory and focus are down and just dont know what to do anymore. Some days all I can do is lay in bed and be anxious, other days Im full of energy and over enthusiasm with bad some nights rest as a result. Ive took my walks in nature, tried meditation for a long time, went to the spa and went to the gym. The gym helped me getting motivated, but later on gave me sleep, focus and fatigue problems. My heads full of memorys, hints and its all just like one big spiderweb. Meditation helped me with the sleep and focus problems, but I couldnt get to the core and discover what I really want. Im an epileptic and have PTSD and already have memory issues due to the epilepsy, so when Im at the psych I forget a lot of stuff andor forget to react to what the psych just said so I can complete the story. This has been going on for more than 2 years now and its wrecking my life apart. Im in physical pain, talk gibberish to others, Im hallucinating, Im more insecure than ever, talking to myself, have pushed all my friends and fun things aside thinking about death and suicide a lot, and already have solid plans for it and Im am afraid that my body is just breaking itself down somehow so there is no other way out than suicide.

    "My depression is getting bad again I have struggled with depression and anxiety for the majority of my life, Im 30 now. About 3 or 4 years ago I decided to get professional help and have since been on a variety of medications and pill combinations. Last year in July I tried to overdose on pills and was taken to the hospital. My meds were changed and have been increased since then. I see a therapist but I dont feel like its helping. In August I left a very toxic relationship and also lost my job. I am now married but I still havent found employment. I have applied to so many jobs and gone to so many interviews but they never go anywhere. I already feel like a failure because I lost my job and it makes me feel even worse not being able to find employment. My depression has gotten almost to the same place I was in back in July.

Hell ask whats wrong, If theres something specific Ill tell him, but its been so many things its just everything. And he doesnt know how to respond to that. It just makes me feel incredibly lonely. I havent been able to get out of bed yet 1.30pm here and he just happily stayed on his computer and now hes gone out. I just want to feel better, go about my day but I cant.

A month ago I finally opened up to my parents, things have brightened up, I seeked professional help last week, and might have some counseling with my fam soon. Ive reconnected with people Ive missed, and Im really trying my hardest to stop feeling depressed. Ive even started reading up on meditation and such. My doc and I are still thinking about the meds though. But my bestfriend...is suicidal and depressed, Ill call them John for now. He regularly has the urge to selfharm, skip meals, or do reckless things. And regularly talks about wanting to die and how he wants to do it. Ive given him a lot of advice and Ive done my best to remind him that Im always here. But....its starting to feel like he never takes any advice I give and that hes given up on himself already. He already seeked help long before I ever did but he hates his meds cuz he thinks it just forces him to be happy. Hes an online friend so I cant approach him face to face. Ive known him for so long and I know thats hes a good person and that he doesnt deserve this. He wants a better life where hes free from his family...so I recommended some small job offerings to keep him stable but he doesnt want to commit to it. I recommended he find some hobbies...but he doesnt want to. I told him to try making new friends, he says he already has me... I tried to explain why that wouldnt be healthy and he seemed to try to say that other people will just hurt him...but Im not perfect... I cant provide for all of his emotional needs... I barely have control of my own. I cant help but feel the need to play strong just so he has someone to lean on. I want to finally start thinking about myself and relax...but everytime I do I feel like Im leaving him behind.",

I am sure I am about to name off items that people deal with daily or have gone through so please forgive me for redundancy. We have a 3 year old daughter and weve been together for 7 to 8 years 9 married 5 years. Ive never in my life felt anything as soul crushing as this. I cant sleep and even if I do I cant escape through my dreams because its all I dream about. Im 35 years old and I have gone through heartbreaks throughout my years but nothing like this. I dont know what to do... I dont want to hit the bottles cause I know that isnt healthy. The thought of even dating down the road when im ready makes me sick. I honestly want to die but dont have the balls to off myself. Work is a struggle, eating is a struggle, working out is a struggle...this might sound odd but right now I would love to trade places with a tree or just an object that has no feelings.... I dont really have friends, me and family dont communicate, I dont really have anyone thus why I am on here making a post. I though I knew pain but I didnt. Im really struggling, this is the hardest thing in my life at the moment and i feel like my world has come crashing down. Hell I probably cry 36 times a day, short spurts to long cries.

    "Every night just before drifting off to sleep, I'm overwhelmed with feelings of self hate and guilt. Im a seasoned pro in dealing with depression but this is getting out of hand. It used to happen every once in a while, but now its consistent every night. As I lay here with my eyes closed and I begin to dream, suddenly I realize Im a horrible employee and Im on the verge of losing my job. Or Im a horrible father and my son deserves better. Or Im a horrible husband who should have let someone better marry my wife and make her happy. Or I suddenly realize my finances are messed up for someone my age. Or I feel like Im the worst kind of friend. The tremendous feeling of guilt is absolutely overwhelming and I wake up and have to often times sit up, my heart pounding like crazy. The house is a mess, Ive been working on the same task too long at work and theyre going to find out Im a fraud, I have a ton of yard work I need to do and the neighbors think Im a total slob, my son doesnt feel loved and needs better things in life. The list expands exponentially if I let it, even as I type it out its flowing in like a river of crippling worry, my face is completely bloodshot like Im embarrassed, and I cant catch my breath. All I want to do is go on facebook and tell everyone how sorry I am for being so embarrassing. Or go sit at my desk and work more so I have more to report on in the standup. Or go lay with my 4 year old son and tell him how proud of him I am and how great his Lego creation tonight was. Or clean and organize the whole house so my wife wakes up and feels good about being married to me. I get this frantic feeling like it all needs to happen, but its too late, the day is over, and I messed up again. I did not feel this way an hour ago when I laid down in my bed. It spikes in me just before drifting off to sleep, like I was watching my life in a movie but then I suddenly realize its real and I am overcome with fear, dread, embarrassment, and guilt, like Im driving a train off a bridge or something.",

    "I'm tired of my lack of motivation Hi, first post here, so Idk if the flair is right and if I will be able to put in words my feelings. Anyways, Ill give it a try, so sorry for the long post. Since the beggining of the quarantine I came to live with my boyfriend bc I know if I didnt see him often I would lose my mind and terrible things might happen. My college is trying to transform our courses in online courses, and is mainly succeeding. In the beggining I sort out everything I should do, to not leave everything to the last minute, so in the first weeks I worked like crazy and managed to anticipate the majority of my tasks. This leads me to last week. Last week I confirmed through my professors and schedules that I was ahead of almost everything. I read most of the texts, wrote most essays, made almost everything that I could do. I had almost no day to just relax or do only minor chores. So when I took my bullet journal to schedule last week and this current one, I saw that if I did one task per day I would be free to read my book and be concerned with other things, since college stuff would be done. So I distributed one task for each day untill the end of this week. But I CANT DO THEM! It is driving me crazy because it is only one simple task I must do that day, but I cant find ANY motivation to do them and now theyre accumulating! Im getting mad at myself because its just one stupid task! And I cant do it! And this lack of motivation is affecting other things. I cant wake up early to do my exercises anymore, I cant be happy doing lunch I loved to cook, but now its just an obligation, even my games and my books dont make me happy anymore! Im in a constant state of apathy and I hate this! And now Im concerned that because of this my boyfriend will think that Im just not happy around him bc of him, and thats not the problem at all.

Over the next year it stayed the same, random bouts of sadness and lack of motivation for a day or two at the time. Fast forward to now and Ive started being sad nearly daily. I can sometimes go a week and rarely close to a month without experiencing severely as I have, but like I said thats it sometimes. I have suicidal thoughts so often theyve stopped bothering me. I quite often cry at night and have recently started drinking when this happens. I sometimes think I want to die but I know there are people who care. I have a loving family and great friends. I just cant get what I want out of life and I dont want to live a long unfulfilled life. Dont get me wrong, Id much rather be happy and live for as long as possible, but part of me wants to give up. Im not asking for professional diagnosis, but would you say this is regular sadness or am I verging on depression? Thanks, anon",
    "Needing Time to Heal But BF doesn’t get it....am I in the wrong? So after that, and our weird visit, it felt like he was just making me feel pressure and stress. I felt like I couldnt handle his needs, his constant need to tell me over and over how he didnt understand and how he felt bad for not fixing me. I then decided that I needed to take time apart from him to figure out how to get back on track for me, to try and get better and heal. I realized that trying to be in a relationship with him at the moment someone who just isnt in my everyday life to understand firsthand my situation and then doesnt hearappreciate what Im saying, then freaks out that he cant fix me, etc, just is not conducive to me getting better. I told him all of this, told him I love him but I need to focus my attention right now on me and my health, this is what I need to do to heal. I also told him I cant give our relationship the attention it needs right now. We took a few weeks not communicating as much. When Id check in and say hi, he didnt ask me how I was feelingtreatmentanything about my life at all. He literally responded to a simple Hi, hows your day going by responding with a giant text about how he was not managing it so well, how he was struggling etc, etc. I ultimately now feel angry bc of his behavior. He then asked to have a phone call to discuss his feelingshow bad he feels without me in his life and I told him I cant do that bc theres nothing more I can do, he has to accept the facts as they are, there is no point to getting into another emotional discussion where all he says is how bad he feels. I dont think hes a jerk I think hes just ignorant and literally lacks the ability to understand. But at this point I feel like this is a problem I cannot get past if Im to have any future with him. Ive become so angry too lately bc I feel like even though hes unable to deal with this, instead of trying to educate himself, learn more and understand, hes just being selfish. Does anybody think Im being insensitive, or unfair?",

    "What happens when you text a suicide Hotline? Suicidal thoughts are a thing I deal with all the time, especially when I end up feeling low because I have no motivation for anything. My therapists recommend using a Hotline or whatever when it gets really really bad, but I just dont see the point? Im not going to kill myself, its too much effort. And its just thoughts, so it feels kind of silly to text a crises line. So Im curious what actually happens when you use one?",
    "End of my rope Im so overwhelmed and cant take anymore. This pandemic has created hardships I never anticipated. My husband was layed off over a month ago and still havent received one penny of unemployment. During this chaos, we also found a small infestation of bed bugs so we had to pay a fortune to get rid of them or else be evicted. I dont know what to do anymore and Im feeling hopeless. The one thing that helped my depression immensely was working out at the gym which has now closed permanently. Im completely out of coping skills and the bills still keep piling up.",
    "Do I have depression or am I overthinking? Ive been thinking about if I have some type of depression for a while but put off asking people about it because i dont want to seam like the person who feels sad and all of a sudden thinks theyre depressed. However I think its about time I ask. Every couple of days Ill have moments that can last 30 minutes to an hour or longer where Im not happy, not necessarily sad... just unhappy? even if the main feeling unhappy isnt happening if my friends ask me to go out with them after school I think about going along and then think that I wont have fun and start to dread the idea. This even happens with my girlfriend who I love but if she asks me if i want to come over the next day I will never say a definite answer, instead Ill say maybe or possibly just because I dont know how Ill feel like the next day. I also feel that nothing will bring me joy like video games, i will quickly get bored of them in these moments and try to think of something to do but everything I think of doing doesnt seem as if it would make me any less bored. In the mornings Ill think of the day ahead and absolutely dead it sop much that the night before I prep myself by saying why the next day is going to be good, this sometimes helps a bit but i usually run out of energy. I feel like i have a fair amount of symptoms of a less severe depression but from everything Ive read it seems that an episode lasts around at least a week. Im sorry if this is me just overreacting andor that this is rude about me even thinking i might have depression and that i know nothing what others go through... but I dont know and thats why Im asking. ampx200B also sorry if this is horrible written, its currently 1229am and dont want to read over it and correct it...",
    "At risk of losing the only thing I have left... Please help :( Sorry it's a long one I lost my job. I am being evicted. I have a 5 year old living with me and an 11 year old who doesnt. And my boyfriend is now saying he wants to move back home to Norway... I have no idea what to do, Im a complete mess and feel like my life is at a cross roads. One leads to potentially hurting my daughters, one leads to a literal dead end for me... which will hurt them more. ampx200B Bit of a background Im 31, been abused my entire life, by parents, by siblings, by random strangers and ex partners. Ive been in abusive relationships, mentally and emotionally abused, sexually abused at least 5 or 6 times... Ive been raped. I lost custody of my eldest daughter because her father kidnapped her after I tried seeking help for her anger issues. He refused to bring her home after a visit and the Social Services let him get away with it. My youngest daughter was 8 months old when her father had a heart attack aged 28 on our sofa while I put her to bed. He died instantly. I moved cities and my mother disowned me, so did my brother and my grandparents. I have nobody. ampx200B I ended up in a string of very abusive relationships, got engaged to a man who left me no choice... All the while, I was talking about all of this with my best friend. He was so supportive, so wonderful... I was going to move to the US again, coerced and manipulated into it but I had to meet my best friend first, as it was our one and only chance of meeting in person. So I flew over to Norway to be with him and hang out for 3 days. Nothing happened. Nothing at all... but it was obvious we both wanted it to. He gave me the strength to leave my abusive fiance Who by this point had sent death threats and abusive messages to said best friend and all my other friends, threatened to kill himself and his 3 year old daughter if I didnt move over there. I became a target for abuse from his family after we split up.",
    "Weed and depression I started smoking marijuana at the age of 15 at first it seemed like the best thing in the world, but as time went on, my anxiety started to dominate in my life, causing me today to have depression. Nowadays I cant stop smoking marijuana because my friends are always smoking and it is inevitable not to smoke, every time I smoke I feel like its a bad trip I get stuck in my thoughts, judging myself, creating impossible situations to happen and I cant get out. last week i was having suicidal thoughts worst of all i dont want to kill myself but i cant stand the suffering anymore and every time i smoke i feel those same thoughts, im afraid ill never be able to smoke marijuana again since I miss the trips that I had in the beginning. Any thoughts on what I should do?",

    "Girlfriend self harmed HELP!! Me and my girlfriend before we started dating, talked for a little over a month. After that period I went MIA because I wasnt in the best mental state to be talking to people and didnt want to hurt us. I was MIA for a month and I returned and I apologized for not taking for so long and it ending making things worse. That night my girlfriend and I started a FaceTime. And she was in a bathroom. She said chase look  very gleeful and had blood coming down her wrist. I was in shock. I talked about later with her and she said she did self harming because I was gone for so long that when she saw me she had the urge to cut herself. Her cutting herself has been a thing for a little bit now but Ive been recently depressed because I made her do that. I just want to puke thinking of what me being gone did to her. I worry that if I ever left, shed cut and maybe kill herself. I worry that I might need to take a week break from reality And Im stressing about it somewhat becoming into a depressed state 247.

I have read some post of other people here so I think I want to share my thoughts so that I can get help and your options on how can I be better. First off I live in Hong Kong. I have been studying for a while. I am now having a never important exam that I need to have soon. I have been studying for 247 but never get any results. I dont like studying. But out of studying. I have no hobbies and friends. I am not good at sport and art or even music. I can just study. I need to improve myself. But I cant. I get that being top 5 in my grade is nice. However I can never feel happy. I hate my teachers. They always force us to do the work in their ways. I wanted to die. I cant find the meaning of life. I cant find joy. I wanted to die. Every thing I have done is trash. I cannot find anything that will make me happy. I tried talking to my parents. However no one cares. They just said oh. And that is all. I really needed help but I cannot find anyone that cares. All my classmate are depressed and wanted to suicide. I need help. I will update soon. Thanks I got to study bye Reddit.",

    "9 days sober and losing my mind I have given up all illicit substances, not for any inspirational reason, but because I am miserable at my job and any potential new job is going to have a drug test. Ive interviewed at several places that say I would be a perfect fit but keep falling through on their end. I have been extra low these past few days due to my own depression, miserable job, chemical swing from sobriety, and family stuff, all happening at the same time. I am trying so hard but every day I want to get high off my ass. My brains rationale is that because Im doing so poorly I deserve to get fucked up. I am trying to break down this idea bc it doesnt benefit me. I am doing my best but my best is just so so so shitty compared to any average person. I want to get better. Getting a new job will help a lot but obviously not solve all of my problems. I just need a reason to keep going. And I cant think of one. Im so sad and anxious and I just want to get high. Any support or suggestions welcome. I feel like Im falling apart.",
    "Teenager with no hope. Im a senior in high school right now, and as far as I can tell, I have a bleak future, and an even bleaker present. Im too lazy to get grades better than Cs, and my social life is worse than an 80 year old retiree with a dead spouse and estranged children. I feel as if my default state is depressed, with small bouts of happiness, then back into the trenches for me. I keep thinking Ive found happiness in the love of someone else, only for it to be stomped out and kicked until I taste the blood. I can make people laugh and they seem as if they like me, but when the school day ends and everyone goes home, no one calls, no one texts, and I doubt anyone thinks of me. Its gotten so bad, I dont even like to listen to music anymore, something I used to look forward to a little while ago, now it just seems like unnecessary noise. Every time someone asks what college Im going to and I reply with X Community College, I see the disappointment in their eyes. It seems as if everyone else has these nice lives, and the perfect SO. Dont get me wrong, Ive had girlfriends, but they never lasted long and ultimately didnt mean much to either person. I know they say having an SO just causes more strife and pain, but I just want to see what a proper relationship is like and experience the life everyone else talks about. I know this story has been told before by countless people before me, and will be told by countless people after me. I just want to escape all of this. Im not suicidal yet, but I fear what comes next. Wow, I sound like a pretentious asshole reading this back. I just want to know if anyone else has experienced this, and what you did. Or atleast, something I could do to help myself. I will now check my phone every ten seconds hoping for a reply. What a life.",
    "My boyfriend is depressed, I want to help the right way Hi, so Im not sure if Im right here, but my boyfriend is having a severe depression since he is maybe 14. He is getting help since one year and takes serious dose of medication. Weve known each other since eight month. He is lovely, he is just the right guy for me and in my eyes he is perfect. He actually is always tired, in this state most of you probably know, but I think he is getting a little better. Only he has those phases where you just feel nothing and at the same time kind of despair and dont have any selfworth and I cant find the right words really. I hope you know what I mean. Well I dont know what to do. I always offer him to talk to me and say what he currently is feeling, only if he wants to of course, but he just says that since it is the same thing every time he just needs to get through it. I dont know if that is good for his mental state this believe, because I think he thinks he is troubling me by talking about this, but it is not. I have told him that I will listen even if it is the same thing every time and that he does NOT waste my time! Still I feel really helpless if he is in this state of mind and Im not even sure if I should say anything. And if you guys can tell me if there is anything you would like someone to say, do for you when you are in this state of mind, could you tell me? Maybe that will help me to say the right words, or show him my support the right way or that I should just leave him pass through it.. I of course realise that everyone in their depression is different and that there is not the right way, still maybe it helps.",
    "My self care plan, and I'd appreciate some further advice. Hello everyone, Im a 26 year old woman and I suffer from depression. Im in therapy and on antidepressants. I attempted suicide in April 2018 but, since then, Ive made a lot of progress and Im quite happy with myself. But loneliness is still a major trigger for my depression. Tomorrow Ill leave for another city because I have to participate in a public competition for a workplace Im in Italy so, in order to work for the Government, you have to participate to public selections. Problem I dont know anyone in this city so Ill be alone for seven days. Yes, Ill meet other people who apply for the same selection, but at the end of the day Ill return to my hotel room and Ill be alone. And Im very scared. This is my self care plan, that I organized with my therapist  focusing on the public selection  bringing my favourite books  Netflix for the nights  going to fine restaurants and enjoying good food  visiting the city in my spare time  calling my SO andor friends if I really feel overwhelmed Do you have any other advice?

I grew up pretty poor, always housed but it was a messy house and we were not great in ways of food or new clothes or entertainment. Thats where hhighschool musical comes in.

Everything something like video gaming nights with the boys memes or this instance of people trying not to sing a song I dont know, I feel like I missed out on so much that everyone else got to experience because they had more money. Or, parents that were better at organizing their money.

    "Today I reached my rock bottom I flunked the bar twice and what is more painful is that ALL my friends passed. I am happy for them but there is a part in me which thinks I am inadequate for not being able to pass it. Everyone I know, even those who do not do well in law school made it. No comforting words can console me. Every time I take a nap I really I would die. I am even having this evil thought I get corona virus or something. My sister shouted fake news when she thought I passed. I saw their excitement. My parents ran towards me. But when I said I actually failed again they just turned their back and left. No comfort whatsoever. So now I am all alone. Images of my ex when we were breaking up during my bar review was recurring and his words which go like I have nothing to be proud of. I just proved him right. My friends are all cheering up on me but everything is just cliche. And what do I expect? They cannot mourn with me bec they are all celebrating. I am currently employed in a law firm that I love but if I have to take the bar again, I need to resign to pave way for my review. I also dont want to stay because the work would get me reminded that I am not a lawyer. It is heartbreaking to leave a firm I finally love. Then bar in our country is moved to 2021 due to corona virus. I am going to derail my life for 2 years. I am more than delayed. I feel so left out. I see no purpose in life.

    "I am nothing anymore So I have been depressed all of my life as long as I can remember. I didnt really know what its like to not have that sinking, dreadful feeling in my heart. That is until I met my current boyfriend. He makes me feel alive and happy again. He pulled me out of the darkness I was so deep in. But I can feel myself starting to slip again, and Im trying so hard to not let it drag me down. I used to self harm, and I promised him Id try as hard as I could to not do it again. For like 3 weeks before the present one, I was completely absolutely numb. I didnt laugh, didnt cry, didnt feel anything at all. It was the worst feeling in my life, It felt like I just died and had no soul or heartbeat, but worse. It was terrifying, and I never want to go through it again. But after about three weeks of feeling that way, I selfharmed, partially to prove I could still feel something. And for some reason, I didnt feel the sadness I usually do when I relapse. I just felt alive. And I slipped out of that terrible numb feeling. I feel alive now, and still numb, but not as bad as before. But the problem is, Ive slipped into a different type of numbness. Its like I dont care about anything anymore. I have 3 grades below a 50, and I really dont have the energy or motivation to care, even though I want to. I honestly wouldnt care If i just got hit by a truck or like had a heart attack, but its not like im gonna go out of my way to make it happen.

Man I am just completely sad like I really am sad man I dont do shit I like anymore I want to find something to numb the pain and I want to hurt my self with something man just dont know what tho. All this verbal abuse shit that I still goes on in my life made me think about love completely different then anyone to be honest I will probably not even ask anyone out to be honest just might not even going to try. Anyone that trys to be nice to me I tend to say thank you but in reality I doubt myself I dont think anyone likes me even my own parents I just dont trust much feelings anymore just does not even matter to me I see it as a joke to be honest.

I know I should keep moving on, she didnt even have the decency to breakup with me in person after 4 years together, but it feels impossible with all the feelings that have come back. What should I do?",
    "ah depression hi, im a 17 yr old and an aspiring musician. been having a hard time lately. very hard time. had friends a few months ago but im just a weird person and its hard for me to maintain my relationships, im also so socially anxious i cant really just text my old friends and say hey i miss you or anything, and i cant really make new ones. every time i open my daw digital audio workstation music i just dread it until i give up. i have a couple vices like smoking weed every day and vaping nicotine, and i just feel so dirty doing it. im in an alternative school program and work full time just to go home and do nothing. sometimes i make it out of my way to go to work just so i can have something to stimulate me, to pass the time. i dont know the answer of how to get out of this. i feel like i was given the opportunity to make or break, i didnt realize, and i broke. can someone please help me out of this shit",
    "Spiraling out of control I can confidently say this is the hardest my depression has hit me in the 10 years Ive been struggling. I find myself so angry, lashing out at people who love me and just destroying everyone in my path. I just wish I could have a second chance at this. I am super hard on myself and cannot seem to control the negative self talk. I beat myself up over everything, especially not being able to control my emotions. Ive seen so many mental health professionals that I just get tired of telling my story over and over again. Committing myself to therapy or standing psych appointments seems more exhausting than suffering alone. I dont know what advice Im exactly looking for, so please forgive me if this is all over the place. Im just desperate. Im thinking ending my life, but Im definitely too much of a coward to carry it out. Any input or kind words are welcomed. Thank you",
    "Someone gave me this \"advice\"? Basically I just wanted to ask if this was reasonable advice. This person knows Im extremely suicidal and depressed and have a bunch of mental problems. They also know that Ive been the only one to advocate for myself for years for treatment. I am receiving treatment, and my therapist even says Ive been trying very hard. This persons advice to me was just, Just try harder. You can always try harder. And they refused to understand that sometimes you just cant try any harder, you reach your limit, or even that you might need the help of someone else to help get you through. They said that needing anyone elses help is toxic and unhealthy and thats using someone as crutch, you will never get better, etc. Just completely disregarding everything I am feeling and going through. Am I wrong to feel upset by this? I feel like its a bs answer to shrug off any responsibility as an important person in my life.",
    "To everyone who actually took time to read this, thank you for caring for me, a random stranger who probably doesn't deserve getting much help anyways. I got depression around the age of 11, but I just never bothered to get myself help until I was close to really cracking down from all the stress and anger Id hold in from all my encounters with my sister and her husband. We dont get along, and they always gang up on me, saying how my best friend did this better than me, I was always so bad at this or that, or how I was so fake and I always lied to them. They say other things too. My mom started this nightly ritual for me, and it really helps. Shed take Vaseline, which would help heal wounds, and shed spread it all over my arm where Id hurt myself. Then after that she takes this long seethrough sash, and shed tie and secure it on my arm so I dont pick at my wounds and scabs at night, because I do that a lot just so I could feel the pain. But every time in the morning and afternoon, Id always reopen and add more cuts and pinches onto my arms. This really stresses out my mom because I never stop, even if she really begs me to. I just get mad at her and say that it helps me. Today, I had gotten into a pretty bad argument with my sister and brotherinlaw. The previous night, I snuck my iPad into my room no electronics in my room, and I stayed up till 4 am playing and talking with friends, who were pulling an allnighter. It was fun, until my brother in law read my messages without me know and he found out. He got really pissed, and they enforced my already strict parental controls on my iPad, and now I can only strictly use it for a few hours at a time. They also deleted a few of my apps they didnt like me using because they didnt use it and found it a waste of time the apps were things like TikTok and some games. While I was using my iPad, my brother in law got all in my face and pointed out how I already used my iPad for 4 hours already, so he told my sister to block my iPad so I could stop using it.",
    "Has anyone ever felt like their brain has shut off? Thats the best I could describe how Ive been feeling for almost 2 months. Im just overwhelmed with everything thats going on in my life and the world to the point where its hard to keep up. Ive been hearing nothing but negativity thats been happening in this world and it caused an overload to my brain. Its been difficult focusing and Ive been feeling more apathetic. Nothing brings me pleasure anymore. One of the things that helped me cope with my depression has made me lose interest in it. Its bothering me a lot because it happened so abruptly. Has anyone overcame this? If so how?",
    "I don't know how to help my depressed friend. She basically doesnt care. ampx200B Shes like ive just accepted that everythings bad and its gonna say that way and im like  no things can get better, nothings set in stone. but no ones gonna change it for you. You need to do it yourself. and shes like i dont care enough about it to change it. ampx200B Thats basically it. No matter how shit things are she doesnt care enough to try and improve them. idk how to help.",
    "Thinking about suicide watch Ive recently been feeling suicidal. I take antidepressants and meds for my anxiety but they havent been working the best recently. My dad, brother and sister will be out of town for the next week so it will just be my mom and I home. I want to go to the hospital or er this week and tell them that Ive been thinking about suicide. I dont want to worry the rest of my family so I thought this would be a good time to go. I want to know if this is a good idea and what happens if I go and tell doctors and nurses this",
    "Is it ok to not want to tell your parents why you're depressed? Im depressed and my family knows this. Ive been diagnosed and all that stuff. Next week, I wanted to stay with a friend because the closest I get to feeling ok is when I am with them. Itd be nice to have a break from everything. But they refuse to let me go until I talk to them. But I have nothing to talk about. I have many, many reasons as to why Im depressed and at the same time none at all. I dont want to talk to them about it. Im getting a therapist soon and Ive talked to my doctor a little already, but they cant seem to respect the fact I dont want to talk to them about it. Please help me. What can I say to them to convince them? Is this normal? Do I really have to talk to them about it, even though Im already getting help?",
    "Going from deep depression from sudden energy?? Hi everyone, Please tell me if anyone has had experience with this? So I have not been to work since last Tuesday. I have been a in a severe state of depression for days and days now. Ive literally just stayed in bed and taken the kids to school late ugh. I hadnt done really anything else. Ive barely been sleeping.. like an hour here and a couple hours there. So thats means its been about 7 full days. It was almost at the point where I was thinking about checking myself in somewhere to get help. But I woke up today .. and I just... cleaned... and cleaned.. and cleaned.. like the entire house. I just kept going like I had an I infinite amount of energy. Dishes, laundry, mop, swept, vacuumed, ect. I just kept going and going and going all day long. Like wtf is wrong me?! Im so confused!!! I feel like I should be glad Im up and about but instead Im just sitting here like what the fuck is wrong with me??? Who goes from being severely depressed to getting up and cleaning the entire house? !",
    "I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to keep going I posted yesterday, but things keep getting worse. So my spouse and I were given a 30 day move out notice because our depression mess was too much for them. Its not even thats bad, and weve been actively trying to get better, but they wouldnt work with us at all. My spouse called her mom today to wish her a happy birthday and her mom ended up asking a bunch of questions about our plan and what were doing, and my fiancée broached the subject of her possibly taking our cats. Her mom proceeded to freak out at her and say that she was being disrespectful and then yelled at my spouse for being manipulative when she started to cry. She then said that if we really cant find anything that we can move in with her, but obviously thats not something that any of us want. My spouse is currently sobbing in the bathroom, barely able to move, and I just feel so utterly fucking helpless and afraid. She told me that she wants to kill herself so fucking bad but that she cant because that would be unfair to me. I worry every fucking day that this will be the day that her will to live outweighs that guilt she feels for leaving me. I have for a long time. I used to come home when I worked an earlier shift from her and check the closet to make sure I didnt find her hanging there, and that was even when things were going relatively okay. I dont know how were supposed to do this. How do we get an apartment if were being kicked out in the middle of our lease? No one will want us with this on our record. Im terrified of if we have to go to her moms. I would suggest that just she move back in because I think part of her moms issue is with me and I find a couch to crash on until we can figure it out, but I worry that her mental state would get worse being at her moms without me, dealing with her mothers emotional abuse every day. Im terrified. I feel like Im spiraling out of control. My spouses mental health is so much worse than mine so Im the one who always has to be strong and supportive, but Im losing it.",
    "I have lost all my friends and am stuck in a nightmare. I spent the last 45 minutes carefully putting together my story and tried to tell exactly what happened in the past year, but then the Reddit app decided to commit suicide before me and I am too furious to write all of this shit again, so Ill just get straight to the point I have lost all my friends. I get especially sad because even my best friend we have kissed several times... just doesnt care anymore. My mother doesnt support me at all. She even keeps insulting me and makes things a lot worse. I seriously dont want to live here anymore. Or even living in general, but thats not really the point of this sub. And my father? I dont even know his name. Absolutely no contact whatsoever. I have nobody. I get insanely sad when I see other people having a good time, because Im stuck in this nightmare of not having any social contact whatsoever. But hey, at least I mastered social distancing before this Corona thing happened and I have no problem isolating myself... cause thats exactly what I did for the past nine months or so. I dont even need an external trigger like seeing other people having fun and I just get tears out of nowhere and I constantly think about what has happened to me. I sometimes dont even go to school because I would see people which mean a lot to me but treat me like a peace of garbage. I am terrible at school. Before Reddit crashes again, Ill just leave this here and yeah suffering is fun.",
    "Please help, my girlfriend is depressed, I have no idea what to do. M, Both 14 years old. Ive felt Depression. I remember there was a time where I hated going to sleep because when I was left alone in the dark with my thoughts, all I ever heard them say is how fucking horrible life is and how much I wanted to kk myself, and I would fall asleep every night knowing I would wake up the next day with no motivation or reason to get out of bed. Every day was dull and empty, every second was a living hell. I had no appetite, lost alot of weight, lost the will to live, god I hated everything. Eventually things got better, but to be honest its kinda been happening again. Lifes been pretty good for me, materialistically, I have good friends, my relationships with family are good, I have an amazing girlfriend, its not as bad as it used to be, but I still feel like empty shit at times. But this isnt about me. My girlfriend lives a really hard life, which pains me so much because shes an amazing person and only deserves the best. Tonight was going well, we were in a call, we talked, did some homework, talked more, and then she left the call. Over text she said she wasnt ok and if it was a good time to talk about it, I said of course she can always talk to me. She starts talking about how shes been feeling down lately, how she barely ate today, how she feels empty, and how she cant seem to feel happy at a and oh my god it pains me so much. I tell her Ive been somewhat feeling the same and that Im here for her and I love her.",
    "I ( 26 female ) have decided to take care of my severely depressed younger brother (20m ) by letting him move in with me last week and need some tips. Hey all ! I am new to the group and a Canadian I would like some advice. This is a VERY long post so bare with me. I took on basically taking care of my severely depressed younger brother. I am 26 and my brother is 20. I have been moved out for 4 years, my brother has been under child protective services from the overly toxic environment at home. For some background mom is an addict  alcoholic  and dad definitely has mental illness and severe emotional disregulation and is severely controlling and overall unhealthy and manipulative  violent outbursts , tantrums, controlling .they are both functional for the most part but very terrible to be around and our entire family became severely dysfunctional as a result and has suffered a lot. In the past I have had reactive depression but am better now here is what I experienced  Basically I can get depressed when sad events happen like breakup death or I would experience severe anxiety when I lived with my parents  to say the least  . I got depressed and severely melancholic  experience debiliating guilt ans selfhatred  and could not function well for months years after certain events happened so I relate to my brother and understand him very well. However, the difference between my brother and I is that I sought help and still speak to someone every 2 weeks.. My brother was always forced into help by CPS for example. He also is a highschool dropout 2x because of the home environment and I know that the social stigma that comes with this has really weighed down on his selfesteem. He is very smart  beat a Canadian chess champion at chess  but he never takes compliments and feels like his depression has altered his ability to retain information  poor memory, brain fog  . He is VERY hard on himself and I almost feel like he would rather stay depressed as a way to selfpunish himself for dropping out of highschool  he even told me he feels like he does not deserve anything good because he is in his own words a  loser .. and feels like he is tired of being alive. Not exactly suicidal in that he does not intent to kill himself but he is fed up of living so could very well do something dangerous if this continues .",
    "My girlfriend is depressed an I can't help her Im not sure if I should post here, maybe there is a subreddit for people like me... I cant find a way to help my girlfriend, she shows all the signs, self loathing above all. She sees me as perfect and capable of anything obviously far from true and she seems frustrated with the gap between my perfection and her perceived inability to live... In these past months Im trying to help her become more confident in driving, but as soon as we get in a busy road or in the downtown traffic she panics, I take the wheel and I know we will spend the evening with her telling me to find another girlfriend because she is useless... I dont care if she drives or not but I insist for her to try and push herself to get her a victory but so far it just caused panic and problems, should I stop pushing her? I want to give her a sense of progress but I really dont know how, she sees a psychologist but it doesnt seem to help... Worst of all Im starting to resent her, I cant understand the struggle she is going through but hearing her self loathing every night is starting to make me angry and frustrated, Im pushing away these feelings but I know they are consuming my love for her...",
    "26. Depressed, socially anxious, lost and suicidal. One of the only positive things that has happened recently is I began talking to a girl i met on a dating site. We talk for at least 3 hours over the phone everyday. This is the most social activity ive had in a long time even though she does 70 percent of the talking. She likes talking about herself. Hearing her talk about her life only makes me more depressed because she has done so much and made the most out of her life. I honestly have no clue what she sees in me. I shared these feelings with her and to my surprise she is still talking to me, although she doesnt really understand how it feels to have depression and pretty much told me my life is not that bad. So here I am, a 26 year old socially inept man child who has no idea what he wants to do with his life. This dry eye problem is also stressing me out and i really want to get it taken care of so i can move on and do something productive with my life. I really think the military would be a good thing for,mw but I dont want to enlist until my eyes feel better but i also feel like time is running out because i cant join once I get past a certain age. I dwell on the past everyday and i wish I could go back in time. When I think about the past I get depressed and when I think about the future i get anxious. I get so anxious even thinking about being around New people because they will judge me and think i am too quiet. I also am afraid if someone asks about my past and my highschoolcollege life what do I tell them? I dont want to tell people I was a pothead who did nothing in Highschool. I also feel like im playing catch up in learning social skills when everyone else my age just has those skills naturally. I dont know what to do from here.",
    "I got kicked out of my house six months ago, and the only thing keeping me alive is fear, work, and my boyfriend. For context Im 20, F, and very new to Reddit I got kicked out of my house in late September, about a week after I graduated cosmetology school, due to an argument I got into with my step dad that resulted in him screaming, threatening, and punching the wall behind me. After two weeks of couch surfing, I bought a plane ticket to California from Texas with the last of my money, and moved into my best friends families home. Its been six months now and I constantly feel like I should just give up. I got a retail job at a company I had previously worked for within about two weeks of me moving, and other than that I havent done much else. I dont have a car, I havent looked into going back to school or pursuing any kind of education, Ive had a couple of falling outs now with the friends who encouraged me to move here best friend who Im living with included, and my relationship with my family has never been more toxic. The only thing that is holding me together is this job, my boyfriend whos been doing his best through out all of this, and being too cowardly to commit to killing myself. And I hate that Im posting all of this because it feels like such a pity party, but I dont know what to do anymore. I dont know where to go to get help, but I do want to.",
    "This is a cry for help... I spent the next 8 months completely depressed. I can describe my mood like instead of blood, some sort of black ink was being pumped into my vessels. I spent nights crying and punching the wall. I moved to another town for college. Dated 3 more girls but I couldnt love them and I still wanted that specific girl. I dropped out of college and moved back to my hometown to my family to start studying for the big test again and get accepted in a university. How did that happen? 8 months after my breakup, While I was spending my days and nights depressed as fuck, I saw something on Instagram. A girl from my hometown whom I had a crush on for a year followed me on Instagram. I saw her post and stories to know her better, and she was EXACTLY my type. Her taste in music, her beliefs atheist and her style and her face. She was kinda the one. As Persian names are not familiar to you, I refer to her as Jane. And, I refer to myself Jack. I started talking to her on Instagram, and we hit it off. I reached one of my girlfriends who knew her. And asked her if Jane is single. She said she got back together with one of her ex boyfriends, and that guy is a fucking douche. He had convinced Jane that their breakup was her fault and she needed to grew up. Jane is also 19, and the guy was 20. That guy was driving Jane crazy. He disrespected her in every possible way and didnt care. I saw that as a great opportunity that when they breakup again, I can date her and treat her the way she deserved to be treated. So I waited. But the next day, that friend told me that Jane asked her did Jack say anything about me to you? She said no, but told her that a long time ago she heard from one of her friends that Jack is into Jane. She told me that the moment she told that to Jane, Jane got very happy and excited, and told her that she has a crush on me too. I couldnt believe what I heard. I wanted her but she was into me too?",
    "Almost 20 years of social anxiety, how do I go on? So Im trying to get over social anxiety for almost 20 years now, 18 of them spent running around from one therapist to another and nothing helped. Im going to another psychiatrist in a few days, and while I was the one to set the appointment I still feel theres no point. I tried CBT, pills, and was once arrested and voluntarily hospitalized for making a dangerous post. Is there anything specific I should say to the therapist? At this point they just send me to a different psychologist every time but I somehow manage to be too hard for them to get through to. I. E. one psychologist, every meeting, asked what are you thinking about as I was staring at the carpet waiting for them to speak, my answer was always simply nothing, as it really was nothing, I just shut off thought if theres no conversation, and it went like this until I got hospitalized where the psychologists in the hospital told me to stop making appointments with her. At any rate, 18 years of therapy, my social anxiety can probably be compared to selective mutism with how severe it is, what do I do? Overall, I quit my job with no desire to find a new one, lost interest in most of my hobbies, lost interest in improving myself because it didnt make me feel better at the end lost weight, listened to 40 books, tried out MMA, tried singing lessons, went to the gym, worked at a hotel to try and get my social anxiety solved, reconnected with old friends and then lost the connection with them after burning out. I know of 0 people that went to therapy and claimed it helped them. Every single one that I asked said its just a scam and at this point I can only agree, the success rate is just too low to justify wasting time on it, especially since I already wasted 18 years.",

    "Being a teenager sucks Hi, To preface this Im going to sum up myself. Im a lonely geek teenager thats an only child with no pets, like stereotype computer geek. I just got back into physical classes again after 2 years doing online ones which I preferred I just moved and am having a tough time making friends and a tough time with my parents Were in a small apartment while ours gets renovated so Im sleeping on the couch and then going to school with no privacy really. My parents always try to turn the tables on me and then make things my fault or make me do things then insult me for things Im forced to do. I got some clothes a while ago I said I didnt like and I said I didnt like the fit , so I didnt wear them, now its my fault that I asked for them or other times they just say that I have to wear stuff because they say so. It feels like every night theres a screaming match between me and my dad or my parents , my mother is always seemingly depressed or has an attitude , I dont have friends and dont know how to make any. I just really dont know what to do. Teenagers nowadays dont care about Linux or old music , all they wanna listen to is shitty rap and use fucking tiktok. When we went to my doctor I had to take an exam where I have high signs of depression and my parents were told I should see a psychologist , that never happened of course They have alcohol with breakfast, lunch, and dinner which doesnt help either and it always feels like the standards are against me and that everything I do gets judged. They treat me like they own me and like I cant speak. Because no matter what I think my mom is always more important all she does it cook and smash I swear to god I really dont know what to do. Ive tried offing myself in the past and my mom laughed at me and screamed dont be ridiculous. I tried to come out as LGBT to them and was made fun of and still am and I have to lie that Im not. It makes me so angry seeing other people in classes and knowing they have pets and siblings and loving parents , and I dont. We just want the best for you Telling me to off myself and that everything I do isnt goof enough doesnt fucking solve that.",

Trying not to self harm or worse, and today I realized that whatever medication does to me, Ill be alive to deal with it, and that might not be the case if I dont start taking it.

    "zero motivation. I cant do anything no matter what i try. Literally, cant motivate myself to work, cant play video games, barely even have the energy to make this post and its only bc i know some other people care about me. But life isnt fun. It hasnt been fun for a very long time. I dont know what the purpose of trying is because it never leads anywhere. people keep asking me how i know things wont be good but if i dont have a reason to do something in the first place why do i do it? Doing things i dont want to do requires so much energy, never feels rewarding, and is just so painful. Sometimes it helps other people and that makes me happy. But Im trying to live for myself and i literally cant because I guess every other human can just robotically perform physical actions without motivation. Small goals dont feel rewarding and holding myself accountable never helps because I dont know why i should care what even i think. I know thats silly but thats literally how empty i am. I cant speak or type or even stand up. I spend hours every day like this. Theres literally no reason to do anything. Antidepressants dont help. Would like some ideas",
    "I just don't care badly enough unless I'm in a crisis. Nothing is really interesting or exciting. How do I care enough ? I cant get myself to work on my resume. I cant get myself to apply to jobs. I cant get myself to look for a new doctor. I cant get myself to read a book. Im not even interested in planning a trip. Its all just whatever to me. I only do things if I HAVE to or if Im inspired by a strong emotion. Like if Im angry, Ill do something. But that wont last long. I used to be ambitious. I used to care a lot more. I used to have some sense of passion. Now  I see just how powerless Ive always been and how overall meaningless it is to care so god damn much. I understand I need to be providing others with something of value to get value in return. I understand that the more value I can give, the more value I get. Its just that whatever value I can get in return just doesnt really appeal to me. None of it is incredibly interesting or exciting. And even what I would classify as the most exciting  its not like I can accomplish it. I cant attract the type of life companion that I want because I wouldnt even date myself. I dont have the type of money as Bezos does to see Earth from space and its extremely unlikely I ever will be able to attain it, let alone attaining it ethically without harming others and by paying my fair share of taxes.

The panic doesnt allow me to gather any thoughts and remain present in the conversation. My mind just thinks get out at all times.

I can feel emotions. When Im with friends and family or watch a funny video I laugh and smile, but it just feels empty? Lifeless? Like on a scale of 110 10 being the happiest I know I should be feeling a 10 and in general the situation is a 10 but for some reason I cant seem to get past a 5 at most. Its like my brain is saying this is funny you should laugh and feel happy but I just dont feel that? At least not fully. Its like my 5 is other peoples 10s, both are fully happy just one is less than the other. When other people are laughing so much theyre in tears and cant catch their breath Im only chuckling, even though I know the situation is funny. I cant even remember a time where I laughed so much I was in tears. When I laugh it almost feels like a chore or an automatic response that I could just as easily not do. This is hard to explain but when I laugh and smile its like im not physically feeling it. What I imagine true happiness to feel like is a warmness, something you can physically feel in your body, but when I smilelaugh the outside physically changes but inside I dont feel anything. It almost feels as if Im acting but Im not because I do know the situation is funny. Its like theres a disconnect somewhere. Its hard to explain. And this is just one emotion, I feel this with everything. The only emotions I seem to be able to feel the strongest are annoyanceanger and sadness, but even thats toned down, not saturated, lifeless.",
    "I'm starting to feel a lot of pressure to have sex from my friends and it's really gotten into my head I 16m have depression and cant really manage a relationship or strong romantic attractions anymore. Like any other 16 year old guy I want to have sex, but I dont want to just do a hook up or a one time thing with someone who doesnt mean anything to me. I really only want to have sex with someone Im really emotionally attached too, and I also want my first time to be with someone else who hasnt done it yet. I kinda just assumed that sex would come in its own time until I broke up with my girlfriend about a month ago, where now Im being told that I should avoid relationships for the sake of my mental health. She was also the one who demeaned me for not having had sex before and sorta the reason I need it to be someone elses first time too. She basically made fun of me for not having had sex before, and I never really cared about losing my vcard, but now Im thinking about how belittled I feel knowing that I havent had sex whereas many of my friends have and now I notice all of them sorta expect me to have it as well, and even though I want it to be special and real they still see me differently for not having had it some contextmy friends are also fucking nerds and it is beyond me how any of them have had sex yet. I guess Im looking for advice or consolidation, but I just dont really know what to do",

    "I got into rpg commu to escape reality but It made my depression got worse. Im 22 years old who currently struggling with film thesis in my senior year. My thesiss topic is hard and its stressing me out. And I found this community where you draw a character and roleplaying with others character in some sort of setting like MMORPG. So I decided to use it to escape from some stress from my works. But it turned worsen. I have no friends there and its like everyone is knowing each other. I know the fact that I didnt active much because of my works and Im kind of confident in my drawing and painting skill Im parttime freelance artist. But nobody played with me or make their character talk to mine. I got anxious so I tried to please everyone by praising their characters in introduction posts or asking for our interactions of our own chars. Some didnt reply my message. In the last 5 days, I got sleepy entire day, lost an appetite, I only ate a small meal or snack once in a day and insomnia. I felt left out. So I brought my account to follow their public account with feeling that If I befriend with them maybe theyll be interact with me ? Some of them turned out fine. But theres one who seemed to hate me because stupid me had bad choice of words when complimented their char. At first, they didnt know Im the owner of that char, they seemed happy enough but once they knew the truth, they seemed off and didnt talk to me since. I know its stupid to give a damn about mimicking world where those members came from wherever in the world. But its so stressing when you feel like talking to a brick and everyone treats you like an air. Please say something, I really need support",
    "Im scared i will never have friends again I have had major depression and anxiety my entire life, but i stopped seeing a counselor years ago. In 2016 i had friends that i would hang out with that were also my coworkers. We drifted apart and its my fault. After getting a different job i had a lot of coworkers and some would ask to hangout with me, but i always refused. Something changed in me where i began to completely self isolate and push away anyone who tried to come close to me. Im an introvert, so i keep trying to convince myself that i dont want friends. But the truth is im scared of never having friends again. I realized that truly the only close friends i have in my life are my boyfriend that i live with, my mom, and my boss. Im grateful for them, but i feel self conscious because i dont have any other friends my age. I deleted all my social media because seeing my old friends hangout together hurts, as well as seeing posts of people with their friend groups. I waste too much time comparing myself to others. But now i feel 10 times more lonely without social media. How do i get out of this? I am too scared to reach out to old friends. Is it normal to have no friends? Have you gone through something similar? I would love to make online friends but i dont know how. I feel so alone, especially now that corona virus has taken away my job and i have no reason to go outside. I quit college recently too so its really hard for me to meet new people.",
    "I’m just tired and want to feel nothing Ive never done a reddit post or anything before but essentially Ive been depressed for over 10 years 20 now and Im just really tired. For a brief summary Ive always struggled with family dad I dont get along with is an arse, mom who is mentally unstable herself but is in denial and is far to kind to the point that it hurts everyone the type to constantly be ripped off but to do the exact same thing again and again, exstep dad who made false promises and has gone off the edge of the earth, exstep mom whose a 14yr bitchy girl stuck inside a womens body, older sister who is very over opinionated and its her way or the high way and a little sister who is young enough that shes missed most the trauma but I dont get to see often because she lives with my dad I dont want to get into it because its a long story that has lasted all my life. Ive always really struggled with friends. I find it really hard to make them and when I did I would often get hurt so now theres just a wall. And Ive just really struggled with myself. All the usual low self esteem, anxiety, paranoia, depression. Im keeping it brief since I feel like I can write a book. Im a really lonely person and have been for a long time and I know its because Ive just never had a proper normal relationship with anyone. My family dont talk about emotions and all that and with all the trauma Ive always been very closed off with them ready to bolt as soon as I can. And since Ive always struggled with friends Ive just never had anyone around I have friends now but were just not good friends Im unsure how to explain it. Ive also never had a boyfriend so its always felt like just me. Im very used to people abandoning me so Im closed off. My depression has also just killed the things I love as it often does and I really struggled to enjoy anything or find motivation for it. I went to uni this year and dropped out after a month and still havent got a job. Ive been applying but havent made any cuts and for the one I made the cut for I couldnt do cause my anxiety was so bad.",

And everything we talked about leading up to her return was all a joke. But now Im left with nothing but night terrors. Every night I go to sleep, after drinking and smoking a large amount to try and numb my senses before I doze off. And last night was the first night the night terrors returned. I could hear vividly my ex getting railed by some imaginary ghost figure of my dreams. My heart bleeds and Im at a point mentally where I can feel myself slowly changing as a result of seeing these terrors over and over again. I dont know what to do. I cant make it stop. I have 1 friend that Ive told and I cant tell my family. I wish all of this came out differently. I wish I was a stronger man and was able to stick it out with her during that time. I wish I couldve married this girl of my dreams and built a life together.

    "I'm literally living in a mess Im not sure if this is exactly the right sub for this but Im pretty sure I cant be the only person in this position and I cant handle too much judgement about it because I an already beating myself up so much for being disgusting. This pandemic has hit me hard. I live by myself, I lost my job and my relationship. I am a mess. My family all live very far away. I am falling to pieces and every night when I pass out crying I pray I wont ever wake up. The main trouble is my apartment. Its a one bed tiny place to live but its mine and Ive always loved it. The work I had used to take me away a lot and this has always been my sanctuary. However with everything thats happened and the dip in my mental health it is now disgusting. I havent cleaned in months. I havent done laundry. I havent showered or put sheets on my bed. I literally have no clean utensils or dishes or pans. There is baked on food from months ago and actual mold in my cups. I have taken to hiding under my covers because I am so disgusted with myself. I have a therapist who tells me to take baby steps and one job at a time. But I have done nothing. I am on medication but my motivation doesnt seem to be improving. I am at my wits end trying to know what to do, I have been down before but I have never got as bad as this. I guess Im asking for anyone else that knows how this feels, HOW do I get out of it?

    "My mom said I'm faking depression Hey everyone, Ive never posted here but I hope youre all well. I really need some advice if you have any. I go to one of the top universities in North America and am currently in my 5th year. These past 2 years have had me feeling really low and Ive been thinking about seeing a therapist because I may have depression. I feel very demotivated and tired even though my work load is insane and I cant afford to slack. Often times I feel very worthless, a burden, and a waste of space. I also binge eat which makes those feelings worse. The eating has gotten a LOT better but it still had its moments. Anyway, Ive been wanting to sew a therapist but I need insurance which had been kind of holding me back. My dads insurance covers the whole family I live at home, for cultural reasons but he and my mom would be able to see who uses it. After a year, the feelings got worse and I made the decision, after much deliberation, to tell my mom that I would like to see a therapist and that I would like to use the insurance. She said okay and j started looking but most were fully booked or not taking new patients. Today, we were discussing my sisters divorce. Her ex had depression and was one of the reasons they got a divorce. My mom says that anyone who has depression shouldnt get married, and that it applies to me. She said that she thinks Im faking it for attention because its not visible to her. She said if I do think I have it, I should forget about finding love or getting married. I interpreted her words to mean that people it depression are unworthy of love and that I would ruin someones life like my sisters ex ruined hers. I dont know, the feelings are kind of intense right now and I dont want to cry but theres a lump in my throat and I just want to sleep but I have a huge midterm tomorrow and I have to see her later and my sister is of no help Sorry for the rant",

But there will always a day she will tell that she feels alone, that she hates herself that she cant even look herself in the mirror and says that shes a burden to everyone. It really hurts me everytime I hear those words from her. I always try my best to comfort her, even though Im not with her physically I will talk to her over the phone without hanging out the phone and watch her until she fell asleep because thats the only thing that I can do. Worst feeling is I dont know what to do or what to say to cheer her up whenever she feels that extreme sadness. Also even in regular days, she cant accept compliments. I love her so much that I want to be with her in always. I want to be her shoulder whenever she feel sad. I am not that knowledgeable about how to handle things like this so Im seeking some tips or anything that can help me help her in her battles. Thank you.",
    "I'm 16 and I'm a mess When I discovered that one of my favorite games was hugely hated on the internet, it made me feel miserable, like my taste was inferior, like I was so dumb to like that thing. I spent, no, waisted so much time defending that game online, and it left me with a terrible sour taste in my mouth when playing it afterwards, like the voices of the people criticizing me were echoing in my head, telling me how stupid I was, how wrong I was to like that game. I eventually didnt even finish it. I couldnt play it anymore. And it keeps going. It still happens, I still get that hot feeling in my head when someone hates on something I love and Im passionate about, I feel dumb and I wonder, I wonder if everyone is like me on that regard? Or is there something wrong with me? Is there something wrong with all of us? Im not even clearly sure about the mental illnesses that I have. I feel like I made so many mistakes, so many unachieved things, so many failures in my life,that may not seem much, and Id agree, but mean so much to me, I feel like I have so many flaws, and those thoughts, sometimes, theyre so loud, theyre like screams. And my throat is so sore that I cant scream louder than them, so I just want to be deaf. Sometimes I just want to end it all. I regret so much things I did, so much things I didnt, so much things I said, so much things I couldve said.. my mind feels poisoned, to the point where it can physically hurt. Im slowly heading to become a social failure, with no lover, no friends and no job. My grades are dropping, I dont do any work, sometimes Im so tired at school that all of my body hurts from it litteraly, its a horrible feeling. Its a bit more complex than that too, I cant describe it but I hate it very much. everyone keeps mocking me, sometimes for stuff I dont even understand.

I get so impatient with him and sometimes I find myself blaming him and I know, that is a terrible thing to do to a depressed person and that i should be patient and understanding.

The worst part is, that he has been away for two weeks to look after his parents house while they were on vacation and I have felt so good! So so good! So free.

    "Depression Treatment Options MDD for the past 2 years. Bipolar, depression, and anxiety all run in my family very prevelently, but none have received any kind of treatment except lithium for a bipolar grandparent. Im currently considered treatment resistant. Onto my 5th antidepressant now. Done SSRIs, SNRIs, Wellbutrin, and Buspar dont know why my doc thought that one was a good idea, I dont have anxious symptoms. Im beginning to think oral medications are not the route for me unless perhaps a tetracyclic or MAOI works out. Id be interested in trying lithium because I know it has helped a family member and I have also been mis?diagnosed as bipolar, so maybe it could work? Im going to bring that up to my new psychiatrist tomorrow. TMS and ECT sound like great options except the price tag. My insurance would only cover half, so Id still be paying upwards of 10k for treatment. Not something I can afford. So I need to look for something else that I could possibly try thats cheaper. And yes, Ive done psychotherapy and group therapy, and it doesnt help in the slightest. Ive looked into alternate medicine like acupuncture, although i doubt its efficacy my theory is that it works solely due to the placebo effect. and that hasnt even worked for things i thought would work for me. Perhaps clinical trials could be an option, but thats not necessarily treatment for me. Ive been suggested to try an outpatient program or check into a psych ward but Ive heard bad things about them. Plus, Im not sure how my treatment would be any better than just going to a psychiatrist on my own. Please let me know your experiences or suggestions! I am willing to try anything to get better, and Ive been researching my options, but have heard very little experience past the basic medication side of things.",

Around 2013 i began taking lexapro and took it until Feb 2019 but it didnt really help. My oldest brother ended up overdosing form heroin 4 years after I graduated high school. I had a moment where i said to myself enough is enough, stop smoking, get your shit together and do something with your life but that was short lived. A year after that we moved to Florida. This move didnt really fuck me up as much as the first one but it did affect me a little as I do not like change in general. My drinking increased since I moved down here and I smoked just as much. Fast forward to November 2019. I turned 26 and holy shit it hit me like a ton of bricks. I had a huge quarter life crisis and realized that the past decade of my life flew by so fast and I spent it doing absolutely nothing. I stopped smoking and stopped drinking after doing both habitually for at least a decade. I told myself I could not live like that anymore and if I didnt make a change sooner of later I would look back a decade from now and have the same regrets. I began considering joining the service but honestly had no clue what I wanted to do for a career and I still dont. I just felt like doing anything has to be better than doing nothing and it might help me out of my socially anxious depressed bubble that I am in. Unfortunately around mid November I began suffering from severe dry eye which i am still dealing with as i type this. It has cost me an insane amount of money in doctors visits and i still havent gotten better. I had lasik 4 years ago and it might be the cause dont get lasik. This only has made me more depressed and suicidal. I also went to a cheap therapist for about a month during this time. I also went to a psychiatrist and took Zoloft for about a month and a half without any improvement and stopped because of fear that it would make my dry eye worse. One of the only positive things that has happened recently is I began talking to a girl i met on a dating site.",

Shes my friend, so of course I do my best to be there for her and listen to her problems but at the same time, its becoming a toxic situation because Ive been feeling pretty down myself, and its been taking a toll on my emotion wellbeing. I honestly dont mean to sound selfish at all, I really want to help her but I feel like its too much for me to handle. Its a tough situation because I feel like Im not fit to be her emotional support as Im going through things myself and I havent been feeling great for a while but I dont think I can tell her that, I know shes going through a lot. Sometimes I have a meltdown because I feel so much pressure and stress, i dont know how to reply to her, I dont know how to handle it. Feels like we dont talk about anything else other than her problems, and I really want to help but its so hard. I know she relies on me for support a lot. Its been a few years since this has been happening. Shes always coming to me, and Im pretty sure only me and I feel like a sponge just absorbing all her sadness.

Im tired of life. Im mad at myself because I dont trust anyone enough to talk about my problems. I wish I had the balls to end it but I dont.

    "I wrote my letters To start it am safe, I am not planning on ending my life for now. I wrote my letters today. I wanted to see what I would say to my loved ones. They were surprisingly easy to write. 5 total. My exwife, 2 friends and my parents. The ones to my parents were the hardest. I know they are what had kept me alive as long as I have been. I dont want them to have to bury me. That is not a burden I want them to have. But having these letters written does give me some relief in knowing that if I cant hold back the pain anymore that they will know that I did my best and that they were wonderful parents. And that it was not because of them I am gone. That it was because of them I lived as long as I did. That my pain became too much but not because if them. It was my internal demons. So they will know that I held out as long as I could. so I have to keep going for now. So they will never see that letter. But knowing it is there if I cant keep it away in the future is a relief.",

At the beginning of the day, I have these big projects I want to undertake, but they feel too big, so I just end up procrastinating, doing only the bare minimum on all of them at the end of the day and thus getting pissed at myself, cause everything could have been finished already. Then I tell myself oh tomorrow, youll do better youll study twenty pages, youll write a chapter of your novel, youll make a proper meal. Yet I never do that, its just the same cycle.

I dont get out of bed until hours after I wake up and I have trouble finding a routine during the day. I live with my bf23 and he is very supportive but he works a lot. On the days that he is home, we do all kinds of things together and I will even wake up early to clean or make breakfast. But when Im alone, all that goes out the window and I dont even have the motivation to feed myself, brush my teeth, or much of anything.

I am very fortunate in this sense. However, I am worried about the effects of things like social distancing and isolation on mental health. That is not to say that I disagree with these measures whatsoever, but like so many other people, being isolated is damaging to my wellbeing. My question is as a college student living in a dorm without a roommate, how can I cope and what are some things I can do in my newfound time from my room?

    "I got cheated on by my now ex-boyfriend of six years and I feel worthless I didnt know because he never opened up to me even when I asked. He then proceeded to ask if I wanted to join him on trip which just took place this Monday through Wednesday. In that moment I got angry. How could you tell me to go on this trip when you just told me you didnt love me? It wasnt logical. We argued and towards the end he said he was done. I asked him to clarify and he needed some space from me. Fine. I let him be until he contact me on Sunday the 10th wanting to meet up the following day. We didnt end up meeting up on Monday and did a follow up instead on Tuesday. We talked. I was worried for him. I told him that people were concerned for his safety and he just laughed it off with the laugh of a maniac. He said that why did people care. He was so distant. Before I left I asked again where we stood. And he told me to give some time. I asked for how long and he told me he would let me know. Fast forward to this Monday. He told me to have any false hope of getting together. We went on our trip and I noticed he was texting a lot while trying to angle himself to hide his phone. It was something I noticed right away. We moved on through the day. We got to our destination. While laying down on my bed he came laid down next to me. It was odd because he didnt want to be close to me previously. We went about our day. Came back to our Airbnb and as I was laying down again he came into my room again and fell asleep next to me. After our naps we went out to explore the town. Had a couple drinks went back to our Airbnb and ended up sleeping together. The day of the concert having woken up from a hangover we just stayed in had some breakfast and watched the hearing. We eventually got ready for the event we were in town for. We ended up getting to the venue early enough where the line was already forming.",
    "Gf won't get help because she doesn't want to change TLDR gf wont get help. She doesnt want to be on medstherapy because it means she isnt herself, so its kinda like she just wants to be depressed with the idea that eventually she will kill herself What can I do? Im drowning here",

Im this close to ending it all and my therapist will just refuse to let me see the psychiatrist no matter how many times I ask. If I do attempt it will be successful, so its not like Ill have multiple attempts ie. they may give me meds after one. What do I say to get them to think more about giving me them? Theyre so reluctant. I see people complain 247 about how they dish out meds on a platter. But its the opposite for me and there is absolutely no reason.

After having read so many stuff online about all these things trying to understand them and unscrew myself, i still feel like im standing at a dead end. Im in the peak years of my life, i should be working on myself. I should be living the life, making friends, having good days and nights. Thats the reason i moved to another country in the end, to make a better life for myself, not drown in self pitty and sorrow. But the lack of motivation and fear of repeating mistakes from the past is paralyzing and thinking leaves me with barely enough energy to get out of bed and drag myself to work. How does this happen, it was never this severe. Thinking about seeking professional help makes me even more anxious because of the language barriere. I cant concentrate at work or even try to be friendly with my coworkers and i know how it looks, i made almost zero friends in a year since im here and i dont like myself as a person or my actions. I am acting completely irrational and i feel like theres no one to talk to. How do you break this toxic circle?",

As things increase in stress, Im getting closer to a huge episode and its freaking me out. I dont know what to do with myself.

I have 3 kids I grew up in a toxic family mom and dad divorced, seen my dad get locked up a lot my mom never being around because she worked so much. I always wanted my kids to have a better life than me, you know the American dream mom and dad that stayed together. I didnt want them becoming a statistic, I guess the toxic thing never went away. My husband and I have known each other since 1999, his dad died in March of 99 and my dad April of 98 we did a lot of stupid shit drugs and staying drunk and all kinds of dumb stuff. We broke up right after he turned 21 because he didnt want me in his life, I caught him cheating. Well a drunken booty call in October I ended up pregnant, I was happy and we  tried  to work it out, he left me high and dry for most of my pregnancy and the first 2 years of our sons life. Toxic family told him I was sleeping with everything that had a penis so our son wasnt his, his mom paid for a paternity test came back he is 99.9999999 the father  duh I knew that. Stupid me went back again to him, we moved in together he lied to me every chance we are very toxic for each other. We got married in 2006 had a kid 2007, from 2007 till 20112012 something like that he cheated again and made me feel like it was my fault, he lied to me about everything! But he promised hed be better and he was always sooo very sorry. Fast Forward a couple years his best friends dad died when I was going to leave him and take the kids, he begged me to stay I stayed.

    "Depression and anxiety in cross cultural relationships? Year round I contend with anxiety and depression, successfully medicated for around 10 years now. Each winter I battle SAD in the form of depression and anxiety, and all the fun ways in which those can manifest themselves. Work interactions and personal relationships in particular suffer my closest friends either seem not to notice or just cut me a load of slack, for which Im grateful! This past summer I began dating someone who lives in another part of the US and grew up in the Philippines. As December rolled into January I explained how this time of year often affects me and I expect even more so by working strictly from home. I also reminded her that I take prescription meds. Her response is that Americans are weak and we should just get our and walk plus spend time with others, as no one in her home country ever has to take medication. That kind of sounds like bullshit in general, and also felt very insensitive for her to have said. Is it typical for other cultures to regard Americans in such a way regarding mental illness?",
    "Meds helped for a short period of time, but now I have no energy again, and can't do things. Any advice? Long story short I was diagnosed a few months ago, but was in denial because I wasnt actually sad about life, suicidal, etc. I started taking SSRIs LexaproEscitalopram and got a taste of what things could be like. For once, I had all the energy I needed. I didnt spend forever in bed or on the couch deliberating when I wanted to do something, took five minutes to just pull myself up. I no longer felt like I was fighting the weight of my entire body to do simple tasks. After 2 weeks I decided to drink, and thats when it went downhill. For 9 days, I was without energy, spent hours on the couch watching TV each day, not getting up to do much besides work. I doubled my dose, then for a few days it got better. Energy was back, I was doing things, etc. But then it went back to normal. To be clear, Im still not depressed in the classical sense of having negativity about life. I have hope for the future, overall Im pretty happy with where I am. However, I miss having the energy I had. I miss being able to actually work towards my goals and not feel exhausted by basic chores. My mind would go on autopilot, and I didnt have to constantly make decisions to preserve energy. Any suggestions on what I should do next? Ive been on Lexapro for 4 weeks, with a small gap last week where I didnt take it for 2 days straight. Im not sure whether I should seek other meds, keep on my current ones, or even look for other factors when it comes to regaining my energy. Im goign to book a doctors appointment and discuss options, but I wanted to know if anyone else had similar issues, and what theyve done.",
    "How do I gain confidence when almost every person I've talked to has put me down for my appearance? I feel so fucking hopeless, even though Ive been working out, trying to gain some healthy weight and muscle, naturally a quiet but nice person who genuinely cares what people think and how they feel. Been adding protein and healthier food options, and attempting to add more daily calories to my diet as to help me look less skinny and more healthier and fit. But at the same time its honestly for nothing, Im worthless and people make sure to remind me of that. I dont know how I was placed on this earth for basically every single person Ive spoken to, to make me feel like a worthless piece of shit. Im only 19 and I feel so fucking ugly, Ive been told by the nicest prettiest girls that I, Look like an old man. on multiple different occasions. Do you realize how fucking painful that is? Imagine if I told that same girl, You look like a 50 year old lady. I fucking guarantee you shed have been heartbroken from hearing that. How the fuck am I the only person in the world who thinks about how my words can possibly hurt someones feelings? Am I the only person who thinks before they speak?

My OWN friends make fun of my appearance straight in my face. Its impossible to have self confidence when youve literally been proven to be fucking hideous, people dont tease me to share a good laugh. They do it because Im genuinely ugly and nobody cares about how depressed I am and how I have literally not a single person to talk to. I cant get suicide out of my head I dont wanna live with other humans if theyre just gonna make me feel shunned and worthless. I really dont know what to do.

    "Should I kill myself? I am the most uninteresting person and I feel like I am the only one who puts effort into any of my relationships. I slowly got more and more awkward and struggled more and more to reach out. Once highschool started, I did make a small group, but it was honestly super toxic so I had to break free. I couldnt deal with the constant threats and judgement. I left hating myself though and feeling out of place and like a loser. This went on for a while where I had one friend. Untill the end of grade 11, I got to this point where I thought maybe I should just end it, and that was just what I thought every moment. I was so close to doing it but these couple girls in my class started reaching out to me and pulling me along. I didnt tell them anything of course but they would just joke around with me and one of them was super flirty though I didnt read it at the time. I started to get to this happy high in my life, then I met a girl on a bus who sorta signaled for me to talk to her. We ended up dating for almost 2 years. Now one of the girls I met in class, Ill call her Angela, is a friend to this day. Throughout grade 12 we spent everyday together, we would always be togrther at lunch, or between classes. I met a lot of friends through her though, some of them I didnt vibe the best with. A lot of them were suspicious that we were dating, and her guy friends got jealous of me. So they started telling her I wasnt trustable and its sort of weird that we are so close even though I have girlfriend. But, I just vibed better with girls I found. She would rant to me, I would joke around with her, it was a fun friendship. We didnt text at all though so once we werent able to spend so much time together it got complicated. Ill get back to Angela later. My ex, the girl I dated from april grade 11, to december 2019, the end of my first semester of university. Ill call her Kayla.",

My youngest just clings to me and is a very whiny child she hasnt socialised much because of the pandemic. I am finding the pandemic hard to deal with. Im alone. I have no friends to rely on. I dont leave the house. I have health issues, mental illness and Im exhausted. I also have anxiety with going outside now which wasnt as bad before. My mum tries to help out, but shes also a full time carer for my stepdad with cancer. My other family are far away. To add, because I see my mum during the week, I dont like going out places incase I catch anything and pass it onto my stepdad because of his immune system being low. I dont want to take the risk. My husband tries his best but seeing me upset like this is hurting him. He cant and I dont expect him to keep up with a full time job, all the household tasks, as well as helping with the children just because I cant manage. I feel like Im struggling and theres nothing to help. I have done countless rounds of therapy, and all sorts of medication to no avail only one was vaguely helpful and it just made me feel nothing rather than feeling sad.

Ive already talked a lot with him about it all, and hes really good at trying to make me feel better and listening to me. But I just feel so guilty, so I keep a lot of it in.

    "My mother and I had an unsettling conversation in the midst of my depression, and I don't know how to feel... My mother quickly took me out of that daycare and felt so bad for leaving me there. Ive always remembered preschool, but Ive never known what actually happened in that building. After that event, the teens were arrested, and since today, that building had been shut down for 11 years. The next one, the first one I recall, was when I was in elementary school. I was in kindergarten, and the teachers were very strict, and they had the worst principal I had ever seen. He had beaten, tortured, and yelled at many kids, including me. I was once beaten, dragged to the office, and tied to a chair for the rest of the day in my kindergarten year. My mother was pissed off as the school when she saw my bruise marks. When I heard this happened to me, I remembered and regained my perspective on that moment, and two others I now recall. Another time I remember that was mentioned to me was in that same school in about first or second grade. This one kid would bully me over and over, and he would beat on me if he ever caught up to me, and the teachers just let him. One day, I thought I had put up with this crap far too much and was beating that kids ass. It took four teachers to pull me off him. They told my mother to immediately come to the school for my actions, and she took me out for ice cream for standing up for myself, and we were pissed off about how the teachers just let bad things happen to kids at that elementary school. The last memory I remember was in that same year in that same elementary school. One time, I feel off the top of the slide in the playground and busted my head open on the pavement. I was bleeding everywhere, and I now remember how bad it felt. The teachers were just again, standing there. Not even helping, not even calling for emergency services. Just watching. They didnt even call my mother.",
    "How do you find motivation to keep up with cleaning? I recently have come to a point where I cant stand the way Ive been living and I feel as though my apartment being a mess is one of the main reasons for that. Ive been working 5060 hour work weeks for the past two months because it keeps me busy and keep my mind off things. However, I feel from this schedule of working and sleeping, working and sleeping Ive gotten so far behind on taking care of myself and my apartment that just the thought of all the stuff I need to do is overwhelming. Leading me to barely want to get out of bed on my day off because I know how much I need to work on because nothing got done during the week. So Ive decided to cut my hours down to 45 a week, although Ill have less money I feel like it will allow me more time to take care of my outside of work stuff so that I wont be so exhausted all the time. I was wondering what trickssystem you all use to keep up with cleaning and household stuff. Does a daily chore chart work for you? Or writing a list for the week and completing so many tasks each day?",

The internet is my only escape but its littered with so many toxic people, I dont even wanna turn on my computer anymore. It feels awful when your only safe place isnt safe anymore.

    "my “celeb obsession “ has triggered my depression&amp; I know it’s pathetic but I need some support. I feel like a loser writing this but I need help. I am 28 F which makes it more embarrassing. Ive never had celebrity crushes until I was first diagnosed with clinical depression and I went into a rabbit hole. Ive always had this old soul thing, where Ive always had nostalgia for past decades, not only the aesthetic but thinking my life would be better in a different decade  especially seeing the world with Covid  I also deleted my social media 1 year ago Bc how bad it affect my mental state and only came on Reddit to get support. I got out of it, but a little background is I am a survivor of childhoodamp adult sexual abuse amp never had a real relationship due to it. I was doing well mentally until I had to see my abuser which is one of my family members by accident by walking into a family event and not knowing they would be there. Fast forward to now I am 28F. I went to a concert. It was a 80s rock band. Being a rock and roll super fan I love as excited to see this band. They were amazing live amp Ive always had a crush on the young version of the guitarist. Ive read his books and watched his interviews in the past. after the concert I found a way to stalk his Instagram amp watch all his old interviews amp old performances. Triggering my obsession. Ive spent days watching it but realized its ruining me and the young version of him doesnt even exist. Hes old and ugly now. I just became obsessed with the thought that if I was alive in the 80s I could of dated Him and be apart of the exciting life of rock n roll. I realized Im just seeking excitement and validation and nostalgia. I also feel I will never be in a relationship due to my past abuse. Knows this sounds pathetic but Im here seeking support",
    "I have an extremely hard time waking up in the morning. Any advice? Hello everyone. For years now Ive had a really hard time waking up in the morning, and Im only able to get up at a reasonable time if its an absolute necessity. Even then I usually sleep in too long and am late for things. It generally doesnt matter how much sleep I get, I still feel tired. I can be super motivated to get up early as Im going to bed, but Ill still feel like a zombie when I try to wake up and wont even bother. Ive started exercising more and feel a bit better in general, but still havent found a way to fix this particular issue. I dont know why something so simple is this difficult. Any advice aside from Just get up! would be appreciated. Thanks!",
    "I feel depressed but feel like even more of a loser for feeling depressed. I have a stable job now, albeit not something i wanted to do nor do i enjoy. Everything good ive ever had in life including that job, and basically all other jobs ive had is pretty much because of my dad and my last name. All of my friends who started off with so much less and dealt with more pressing issues in life went on to do so much more. I feel pretty much hopeless in finding something that i really want to do or because im not like them. Im definitely not the smart one or the good looking one or the outgoingfunny one. Im the only one whose never really had a girlfriend. Im pretty much just the rich one who at the time was a pity friend of a few guys i knew my entire life and grew up with but a lot of the people I came across in both high school and college never really liked me, not because i was an ass im relatively quiet, but because i never fit into a lot of those circles because of this or that yet because my childhood friends were friends with those guys, i was kind of just a fringe guy to them and still am now that im home. Sometimes i think i put myself in the wrong groups of people in life because i didnt have the social skills to find my own. This whole idea of me not being good at anything worthwhile has really carried into my early adult life. Its to a point now where im afraid of failure more than anything. Im afraid of a lot. Ive been feeling depressed off and on since about July on this go around. I get discouraged probably way too easily. I also feel like a disappointment. Im afraid of telling people that im depressed or that i have struggled with depression in the past. It would disappoint my parents because theyve given me so much. It makes me feel pathetic that im depressed because of everything i was born into. Sometimes i would fight the notion that what i was feeling was actually depression given my situation, but that was always redirected to me just being soft or a pussy in my mind that made me feel even worse. Sympathy always makes me feel guilty, really no matter what its about.",
    "Need help So I usually dont do this and Im not sure if anyone will respond but I just feel like I need to say something, for the last 2 years I have been at rock bottom, I dont have anyone to reply on at the end of the day its just me. Everyone I talk to I just cant connect with and I just feel like they dont like me or care about me or anything I have to do with. I dont do anything to make people hate me I just put it in my head and it begins to spread into the relationship with people. My co workers who say they are my friends say they care about me but when they see that Im in a depressed mood they dont do anything. I just feel like they are only in my life because of work. I have been thinking in my head every day that the world would be a better place if I werent in it people would just be happier to not have to deal with me. I even go to the point where I will make up reasons or find reasons to prove my point, even if Im taking to a wrong way. I do this in every situation and just keep telling myself people dont care about me and ride the proof to make it true. It makes me feel like The world would be better off with out me.",
    "Loneliness, sinking down, and... I am extremely depressed now. This depression sinks me to the bottom today. I am so desperate. If someone in the DFW area reads my post, please DM me. While I was scrolling down my contacts, I found that no one I can contact and ask to meet with me tonight. Those who I have trusted and befriended... I could not call them. I thought that they would laugh or scoff at me. When I was a teenager, I had the protection, socalled parents. However, I feel that I am alone in this world. One night, I called one of my sisters and poured out my emotion. Since I trusted her so much, I told her everything. However, she ignored me and said, Hey, bro, I am so busy with my life. And do not complain about your life. Also, my life is so tough! So could you not throw away your emotion to me? I am not your trash bin! Often, I relied on the counseling service. But, I found that Counseling does not help but exacerbate my depression. The problem of professional counseling is... the counselors have their own frame. And also, at this point, I do not have enough money to receive more counseling services. So, I dont ask for any money but emotional support at this point. I feel that my emotion is collapsing and sinking to the bottom of the abyss.",

This school year tenth grade my academics are horrendous. I have failed math in 23 terms 51 first term, dropped into 40s for 2nd term and my science grade was in the mid 60s for term 1 and i think i failed term 2.

My dad who has been apart of my whole life but not really at the same time because hes a drunk ashle is in critical condition and is dying. I dont know if its because of the emotional trauma and physical abuse he has caused me throughout the years, but i also feel numb to him dying. i feel like i wont even give a shit when hes gone and i know that sounds absolutely awful but i seriously dont feel anything I honestly have no idea how to deal with this right now, because my mom doesnt really believe im depressed and wont take me to a therapist. I know 10th grade is the most important year for math and science academics where i live and i honestly feel like its too late to fix anything. now i cant help but think im going to flunk out of high school and end up working at a gas station for the rest of my life someone please give me some sort of direction or guidance on what i could possibly do because i feel really lost and confused right now, and im terrified about my future with my poor academics right now edit sorry if theres a bunch of grammatical errors, its late at night and i didnt feel like proof reading this before i posted it.",

He has very bad social anxiety. He doesnt have strong from his family who are all pretty dismissive about this. He basically only has me and Im not a professional by any means. When he gets depressed he starts shutting people out, I try not to push him to hard because Im afraid he could possibly spiral. Hes having a particularly bad few weeks recently and the last time things got really bad he shut everyone out for two years. Hes put his life on hold for years because hes afraid and sad all the time.

    "I can’t help myself, and there is nowhere to get help. Things keep getting worse. I am not suicidal, I have always contemplated suicide but I know that I wouldnt go through with it. Lately I noticed that I have been thinking about it more often though. I am saying this because I dont even know if things are actually getting worse. I cant even allow myself to feel bad because I dont really know if Im supposed to feel bad. Im trying to justify why I think that things are getting worse by saying that I think about suicide more often. I dont really know what Im feeling. Im feeling something but I dont know what it is or whether or not Im supposed to feel it. But I guess I can say that Im feeling pretty hopeless. I did Becks Depression Inventory and it seems like I have moderate depression. Which is not a new thing for me, Ive had depression for the last 67 years. Im 23 btw. I used a lot of medications, I also went to therapy for about 78 months. I cant go to therapy anymore because I dont have the money for it. I cant ask for money from my parents because they need to support my sister who is going to go to uni. There are no free therapists around either. I also dont know if I should go to therapy. Am I being selfish? Am I indulging in my thoughts and feelings too much? Other people have problems too, and I would be lying if I said that I have it worse than most people. I also failed at school. In 6 years I was only able to finish the first years classes. I am... lazy. Irresponsible. In the past and maybe even right now, I have acted without thinking about others. My parents worked hard to make sure I can get education. I am ashamed of myself for not doing what I needed to do. I am also ashamed of lying to them about my school. They still dont know that I failed. I dont know if I can say that I tried to fix whats wrong with me.",

    "I feel like shit after I stopped taking pills I love in abusive family and Im traumatized because of it. I cant focus in school, cant ready, every contact with humans makes me anxious and drains me out of energy despite that I used to be social butterfly when younger. I was on Zoloft for 6 months and it didnt really help me until I started taking 75mg doses. Then I stopped taking it because of my parents pressure. Taking meds for mental problems isnt normal form them. Eventually I had enough of their trash talk and gave it up. I regret it since then my symptoms are getting worse and worse.

    "Does anyone else punch themselves as a way of self harm? Every once in awhile Ill punch myself in the face when a very intense bout of depression sets in. Usually its when someone starts talking in depth about sex and relationships, and the magic surrounding it. Its therapeutic and part of myself thinks I should be punished. I guess I cant really express my emotions either because people will find it too dramatic and silly, as I have been told before. No one takes my emotions seriously. Im too afraid to cut my wrists and the endorphin rush from the punches feels so good afterwards, but it hurts and my face swells up. I make sure not to hit my jaw. I feel like its the only way I can calm down. Everything feels so smooth after Im done. Ill only do this every so often though, its not consistent but I think I might start doing it again.

    "26. Depressed, socially anxious, lost and suicidal. A big part of my brain focuses on high school and that fact that I pretty much did nothing during it besides smoke weed and drink. I had freinds but I feel like they werent genuine freinds, just other people who enjoyed partying like i did. Most of the summers I spent alone sitting at home. It was like that in middle school too. I remember joking to a kid on the bus in middle school, telling him I go home and stare at my wall for hours then i go to school. I never had a girlfriend in high school  just a few hook ups. I regret not joining the track team multiple people said i shouldve, I was really fast. I wish I had an intimate relationship in highschool. I was always pretty smart but I really just stopped caring about my grades at the start of freshman year. I had a lot of angst and spite against my parents and I attribute that to why I stopped giving a shit. Pretty much all i thought and cared about in high school was smoking weed. I shouldve been focused more on joining a club and my grades. Although marijuana was a huge escape that I initially loved I feel like it was one of the worst choices I made because it only made me more introverted. It also made okay with the fact that i was doing nothing with my life and not thinking about my future. I had one job as a bus boy which i quit after about 2 months. I graduated high school as a below average student wirh absolutely no clue what I wanted to do in college. I went to a community college for a month before dropping out. While there I felt extremely out of my element, only talked to fellow freinds from high school who also went there, and made zero new friends because of my social anxiety. After dropping out my life as an extreme recluse began. I worked but it was with my dad doing roofing and home improvement type work. I only hung out with one friend from high school and going to his house and getting drunk with his family at their house parties was the extent of my social life during this time. I spent most of the money I made with my dad on weed.",

This time I was out for 2 days. Ive just completely dived back in. I cant see any light when Im like this. I cant eat I cant sleep I cant get out of bed I only think about killing myself. I live alone and its very common for me to not reply to my friends and family, I dont think people would notice for days. I tried anti depressants for the first time, which was a big step for me. SSRI. I became more suicidal but they also knocked me out for about a week. I came off them and felt great for two days bc I had energy.

    "I have frightening intrusive thoughts I 21F have frequent intrusive thoughts and im trying to figure out what the hell is going on. I also posted this in anxiety but this may be a more relevant spot to discuss until i see my therapist in a couple of days. I mentioned it to my therapist and weve only met 3 times so its not really something weve been able to talk about all that much yet, since i have much more pressing issues relating to my depression and needing to discuss my past. My intrusive thoughts are violent. When i get in my head as we all do, i go through memories or my pretendscenarios that i also have playing in my head. If its something im anxious about or i dont like it, or just dont know what to do, i immediately have a graphic imagethought of me killing or seriously injuring myself. These images are usually of me stabbing myself in the heart with a dagger, banging my head against a walltable to find that a knife was there cut to me stuck hanging on the wall by my head, me hurling myself off a bridge, my fingernails being ripped off, me in a boat or plane propeller, turning my car immediately on the freeway... This kind of stuff. Some times Ill randomly have one of me being raped. Specific thoughts i have that trigger this shit is a conversation i want to have about something serious, but i get angry and cant handle it so i slam my head against a knife a memory of a cringey conversation from the past why did i say that?! slams head against knife memory of a bad boyfriend did a bad thing and i handled the situation terribly etc I dont know if im alone in this, I just want to know, and then if you were able to stop them, then how did you do it?

There are days where I feel completely fine, and then Ill have a mental breakdowndepressive episode and usually after one I tend to have more for a week or two. I wont talk for hours, I keep replaying what caused me to feel that way, and then thats it I just bottle it up. I hold onto grudges from my dark past and Its really hard to stop.

I have a really hard time translating my thoughtsfeelings in generaI, literally about anything into words. I just give up on being social sometimes because if I try all I do is stutter. It makes me feel like no one takes me seriously and sees me as intelligent. Because of this Im scared to help, say my opinion, or engage in insightful conversations. I dont feel useful. Though why I do I feel all of this if my life from an outer perspective is more than fine, and privileged. I have a supporting SO, and friends. But, I cant seem to trust them, too.

    "Is this normal? Hi, I dont know if this is the right place for me to ask this but I need answers from those who are in similar situations as I know depression can be tough. I am recently friends with this guy and he was a super nice friend. Along the way, he opened up about being depressed and all. For the past 3 weeks, he suddenly started to cut off our convos short and never made any plans anymore. Each text would end less than 5 mins with him telling me to rest, study or something. But then he came back like everything was fine. We also have a common enemy which he tends to talk about. But as soon as I talk about that person, sometimes he is supportive, but sometimes Ill be hearing remarks like oh, him again? or life happens. I dont think I initiate the talk about the enemy much but I do talk about him time to time when he, himself brings up the topic but then again, sometimes Ill face the same remarks. Am I doing something wrong here? I genuinely felt hurt by his behaviour and I want to know if this is something I should approach him about or it is because of his depression. I would really appreciate if anyone could confirm this for me. Thank you.",

I then apologies and told her that my facial expression always gives a bad impression, but then she nodded and said no, its not because of that. I know its unprofessional but I started to cry after that because I couldnt hold it in anymore. Two Units for which I applied for, suggested that I should apply there. Ive gotten feedback that my facial expression is scary, that I should work on my structure and organisation and that I shouldnt do things that Im not allowed to do yet I tend to try and do as many things as i can so that the other nurses like me but Ive also gotten feedback that when I talk to patients, I give a soothing impression with my voice and with how patient I am. Ive been told that I look smart described that Im the Brain, and I always replied that in reality Im not smart at all and that I struggle with remembering things. I know I have a lot of negative things going on with me but empathyless? I think that people are machines ? where did all that come from ? why do I give such a bad impression? I feel so terrible, I already know Im the worst human ever but I do try my best to make people feel comfortable and welcomed. I never judge them on purpose so where did all that come from ? should I see a therapist just so someone can tell me.the truth about myself ? what should I do ?",
    "Started antidepressant, feels weird I started antidepressant for the first time two days ago. The first day I got a bit of euphoria. But by the second day I couldnt get out of bed, didnt shower or anything. Took my second does, started feeling weird like nausea, headache and altogether an unsettling feeling. Couldnt sleep at night but then I spent the whole day in bed. After my mom bugged me a lot I got up and brushed my teeth by late evening. I feel like crying, I havent eaten anything. I dont want to shower, I just want to stay in bed. I thought antidepressants were supposed to make you feel good. I feel awful, completely awful. My antidepressant is a combination of clonazepam and escitalopram. What should I do?",
    "Exercise depression I dont know if this is the right place to post this but here goes, Everytime I try to start a new workout or diet I start getting really depressed and thinking back to Basic Military training and feeling like total shit. was kicked out of the airforce after an injury while running my talus was removed and failure to stay in shape Right now Im going to college and taking a required Fit to be well class that requires Diet and Exercise logs to be submitted to the instructor, Ive been faking it as much as I can but she will probably notice as I have her for a lecture and lab in anatomy and physiology if I dont get any better physically. Im just worried that other doors are going to get closed if I cant get past this any advice for dealing with the depression caused by the past trauma? please help. Reading the book is even worse it talks about spirituality which being atheist I have none of and emotions are all out of whack. Anyways for anyone that took the time to read Thank you. I wish you the best... also terrible anxiety with councelors in person I just say whatever I need to to get out as fast as I can",
    "I’m 23, highly anxious, depressed, raised by a narcissist/alcoholic, and need a job. I have no clue what to do with myself. Until Covid I worked in retailrestaurants my whole life as I am extremely personable, albeit an introvert. Now with covid, I very much so do not trust Americans wholeheartedly, Im getting the vaccine but everything is opening up at 100 no restrictions near me, which just makes no sense to me. Poor behavior amongst people these days, retail workers are the frontline of managing Covid and policies these days, for little pay. Now I dont even want these jobs as Ive not been social for over a year now. I did not go to college as I have learning disabilities. I also have awful fine motor skills, likely due to growing up anxious a lot due to alcohol in the house. Father has NEVER been abusive physically or frankly intentionally abusive, theyve never processed any emotions so theyre a mess. Still live with them and constantly triggered by it. I also am sorta addicted to weed, as I believe I have PTSD at this point so I truly feel its a need not a want at this point which is frustrating. I could go on and on lol, so, help? Im truly getting to the point it feels things just aint gonna work out for me, whole life has been out of my control. I was adopted, controlled by helicopter and anxious parents, now my anxiety runs my life, nothing is in my control or works out for me it seems. Anyways, thanks in advance for your responses, have a good day all!",
    "I'm probably just faking it? Lately I feel like Im faking my own mental issues. I read this post about a girl who is abused by her mother and homeless. My own best friend is abused by her parents. My mom grew up in a terrible environment and is traumatized. I was bullied for a few years at kindergarten and school and I get yelled at by mom. A lot of people told me that those are not reasons to be depressed, that Im just exaggerating and Im an attention seeker. I feel like theyre right?? There are a lot of people who are going through worse stuff and theyre not able to get help. Someone else definitely needs that hour of therapy more than me. My mind is very mean to me lately. Theres this kind of voice who is telling me that Im just a lazy piece of shit who is faking their own illness for attention. This makes me feel even more shitty. I cant take it anymore. Im not diagnosed because my mom doesnt allow me to get therapy and I rarely go to the doctor only if absolutely necessary. I dont know, is it normal to feel like youre faking your own mental issues? sorry if there are any mistakes, english is not my first language and my mind is all over the place, hopefully you understood what I wrote",
    "I think my boyfriend left me due to his depression and I need some help to understand and deal with this situation. Im so confused and dont know what to think or how to help him. So... Im not sure how to phrase my question or even what exactly Im looking for... I guess I just want to hear some other thoughts on this. Does anyone of you ever left a partner due to your depression? Is it possible that his depression is so predominant that there is no space to develop intense emotions for another person?",
    "I can’t handle myself Hello, this is a throwaway account. I am female, 21 and was diagnosed with severe depression and a bipolar personality disorder. Ive been feeling depressed for 7 years now and last year I finally found myself strong enough to see a doctor and since then Ive been trying to get therapy but its basically impossible since I dont have private insurance. I am on plenty of waiting lists but Ive not yet gotten one call back. I am scared that at some point it will be too late because Im gone. I want therapy so badly. I need it. I am not able to live a normal life at all, everything weights me down no matter how small the issue is. It affects my daily life way too much. When I start panicking, starting to cry, scream, hurt myself, I want to have myself locked up, so someone can look over me, give me medication, etc. I really want that but the thought of it scares me insanely much. Right now, the only thing bringing me joy is spending time with my boyfriend online. Weve been together for a year now and it couldnt be more perfect, except my disorder ruining a lot of things. I play games with him online, we have so much fun. I dont want to lose that. Additionally I am studying and Id be done next year and graduate. However without some kind of help I know I wont be able to do it. I already had to repeat a whole year because of my issues. I dont know what to do. I really want to be somewhere where I am being watched so I can get help anytime I need it. But I have so much to lose. My partner, my dog, my computer, what if they even take my phone? I started writing this to calm down from another panic attack over something super small and it helped me calm down but I rarely have something to make me calm again so all I usually do is scream and cry and hurt myself for two hours till my body is too tired to even stay awake so I basically just pass out... I need advice, support, anything I just need to talk about this",
    "Spiraled into depression what do I do :( Im still in high school and Ive missed a ton of school days because of my depression. My family knows about this but there isnt much they can do to help. Im trying meds theyre not working and my family wont allow me to go to a therapist. Ive also talked to my school counselor but she has not met with me in weeks so I cant talk to her!! Im so stuck Im so scared and I dont know what to do anymore. I cant take it I feel like no one understands me and I dont know how to bring myself back up on my feet again, Im just so exhausted I feel like giving up.",
    "How do others find energy to continue. I just feel so hopeless and numb been contemplating suicide more or less daily the last 5 years atleast. Pushing 30 hate my job, really hard finding a new one and once I do my employer sabotages my references and since there is an abundance of applicants like 200 for every job in my area they simply choose another one. Skilled craftsman in a field no longer required started my own company in highschool which went great for a few years until it didnt. Took my current shitty job to pay the bills, tried going back to college and working at the same time to avoid student loan but during my second year the depression really hit me and I dropped out and the last two years have been a constant struggle to come back mentally. I dont really enjoy anything anymore the only thing that keeps my mind occupied on more positive thoughts is spending a couple hours every day at the gym but even that is starting to diminish in effect. Pretty much isolated myself socially since I just feel worse trying to hang out with my friends. How do others find the energy to continue trying to improve their life with constant failure and rejections? I feel like Im stuck on the same page as if I were still 20.",
    "Could anyone here help me with writing an email? I have been putting off my thesis for months after I told my promotor I have depression in March. I promised her to get back at it in September but I couldnt bring myself to work on it until today. I shouldve sent her emails explaining my situation but I keep delaying because everything related to my thesis triggers anxiety and turmoil inside me. Yesterday my promotor sent me an email which I dread to open. It took me a mountainous amount of energy, some tears, and screams to open it, and I found out that she was asking how I am doing and reminded me that my thesis is a part of a bigger project and that basically, I need to start working on it and update her. I feel guilty to the bones now. I know, this probably sounds very childish and desperate but could anyone here help me draft my email? I have the draft already but I dont know if the content is appropriate enough. My mind is so stupid right now that I dont know how to write professionally and how much I should share. If I can, I just wanna let her know that Im so anxious about working on this thesis.",
    "I can't keep going I have almost no friends, Im failing in all my school subjects, and Ive fallen so deep in love with someone I cant have that I dont think my life is worth living. Ive thought of killing myself many times before, but Ive never gone through with it because of the impact it would have on my family and the people I care for. My best friend is a girl who Ive fallen in love with so hard that I would literally give anything just to see her happy. But she doesnt feel the same way towards me and I dont want to leave her as Im the person she turns to whenever she has a depressive episode. If I ended my life she would be left with nobody and Im scared for what would happen to her, but I know she wont ever need me the way I need her and that thought itself is one of the reasons why I feel so down. I dont think Im ever going to love anyone to the extent I love her so whats the point of living if Im never going to be able to feel emotion to that same level. Im sorry if this im just another stupid kid rambling about their problems but I just want to go to sleep and never wake up to face another day of loneliness",
    "I'm seriously considering suicide again. I wont label my social issues, as I havent got a clinical diagnosis like anyhting else on this list, but I think it fits more into the antisocial category than asocial or social anxiety, because of my negative and possibly misanthropist views. I have 2 past suicide attempts, once by asphyxiation, and the other by insulin overdose. Now, Im just wasting away, induging myself and slowly poisoning myself. My only friends 3 or 4, whom Ive always valued highly, are distancing away from me slowly, after nearly 6 years of friendship to be honest, I dont blame them, because Im fucking weird to hang around. But it does hurt quite a bit. I have a cousin 3 months younger than me, who has a much better and more successful life than me. His father my moms younger brother by 1 year is the current president 33rd of the KoreanAmerican Association of Chicago and a Northfield Township trustee. My cousin has a better social life, better health he is ripped as one would describe, and taller than me, while I am barely keeping my muscle mass together. Im 56kg, 170cm, has better looks than me, is a better student no problems in school and is just allaround a better person than me. People follow him around, and as much as it hurts my pride to admit this, I am envious that girls just follow him around. My family isnt very supportive neither. My aunt and uncle cares for me I hope but treats me as if I were some lazyass scum, because their son is objectively better than me, even though I am doing my fucking best, trying not to die from a DKA every day. I lost 56 pounds in 2 weeks, all muscle mass, because I dont have much body fat. I excercise semiregularly 45 mins a day, 34 hours a wekk, maybe, I study, I do what everyone else does, and I even put more time into it all possible because I assist school once a month now, all assignemnts are submitted through a school intranet. My grandparents the ones alive clearly cares more for my cousins than me, and they dont necessarily hide that.",
    "Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result Basically, I feel like Im doing all the things that someone with depression is supposed to do. I exercise, eat relatively healthily, maintain several close relationships with friends and family, take medication and vitamins, go to therapy, try to keep busy but not burn out... And Im still stuck. Theres no situational issues or any residual trauma that makes me feel this way. Ive just always been depressed, which runs in my family. It makes me think of the quote, The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. I feel like Im just working WAY too hard to stay afloat, doing the same things every day and expecting that eventually Ill feel better. I dont want to give up. Im NOT going to give up. I just feel crazy, I feel like all of my energy is going towards keeping myself alive, and I dont have any room to just BREATHE. Ive had to leave work early or call in sick a few times in the last few weeks because I couldnt stop crying about nothing. Im so stressed by just doing my basic daily routine that I have kind of a meltdown every night when I get home from work. My days off are equally difficult. I try to do the things that I know bring me joy, even when I dont feel it. Im just starting to feel a little bit insane expecting things to get better without some sort of change, and I feel that Im running out of options for things to change or improve.",
    "I'm freaking out over the fact I'll never find someone and its making my depression worse ampx200B ampx200B Ive had depression since I was a kid and now Im 26, So about me Im 26, Im back in college after being too depressed to function and failing a bunch of classes failed one this semester as well Im a sober and recovering alcoholic havent had a drink since the last day of November and I had ASD, ADHD for which Im on medication, and I have depression. At this point the latter of which is pretty much killing me by inches and honestly I think its going to kill me before Im 30, Ive attempted suicide twice in the past but I failed and then two other times i was stopped in the planning stages. But Im really really really trying to be better, Im back in college with a changed major to Compsci and biotech dual major and plan on trying to be a computer programmer, Im learning to drive and getting my license, Im looking for a new therapist, Im over 4 months sober, Im eating better and exercising, Ive signed up to volunteer at a food pantry, i ever gave blood and plan to again to help others and to help me get over a fear of needle. Im really trying to be and get better, but its not working, Im still depressed, Its still killing me slowly, hell the only reason Im alive rn is I dont want to hurt my sister, And now Im freaking out that I know Ill never find love, Im 26, Bisexual, A virgin and my only real relationship ended on my 21st birthday when she broke up with me at a party and I was born on Valentines day, Im a recovering alcoholic, I live with my mom and brother, and I just feel like Im too screwed up for anyone to ever love me, part of me literally is telling me that if Im still alone and or a virign at 28 then its a sign that I should just kill myself, same if I still live with my mom at that age. I dont want to go through life alone, I want to fall in love and get married, I just honestly believe it will never happen. I dont blame other people, I dont blame women, Im happy for people who are in a happy healthy relationships, I just dont want to be alone my whole life and Im scared and depressed and I just dont know anymore.",
    "I feel like I'm failing in life in itself and it's serious. I very always had a lazy streak but have worked years. I got laid off around a year ago. I guess Im depressed because I cant get back on track. Im very shy I dont like being around people even though I have been but now I liked it even less and Im not even looking for a job Im just living off what I saved for years. And I dont go out much actually Ive been like a hermit for almost a year so I was wondering if anybody actually was like this as well?",
    "Is my \"popular\" intensive trauma program abusive/unfit/re-traumatizing for me? This was the ONLY personalized meeting I have had in this program  everything else was groups or front desk people doing questionnaires. 4 I have had no meeting with anyone during or before the program regarding what I need or how this program is customized to me. 5 almost every individual in the program is on medication and there seems to be general push towards strong sedating medication. Most members could not even sit up during groups due to the level of sedation. 6 I have corrected the clinicians and staff over 4 times in a single day with the name they use for me and they continue to use incorrect names for me. I dont feel respected. 7 The staff seems to treat every action of every client as a sickness. For example, a woman felt emotional anger when someone was rude towards her in public  the staff fixated on the validity or invalidity of that anger instead of the safety needs in that situation. 8 The staff and the program itself feels very paternalizing. Example  a clinician did an activity asking everyone to name vacation spots that start with F before jumping into talking about emotional dysregulation and severe distress. The clinician an intern in training had a color wheel with activities at the level of a 4th grader for an adult group. 9 The program is apparently owned by a forprofit company and has dangerously negative reviews on google by clients and on LinkedInGlassdoor by staff. ampx200B How do I navigate my care when Im feeling unsupported by the current treatment?",
    "Does anyone have any advice for someone living a very unfulfilling life at 26yo? Im 26yo. Ive wasted a lot of my life, idc thats in the past, Im looking to move forward and I want to start living a fulfilled life. Id say Im overall very unmotivated but when Im having a good time with people and find likeminded people who I can build connections with, I feel good and thats something that motivates me. However I get easily hurt by people and everybody I meet seems to hurt me. I feel like I should be motivated by career success but I dont care. I just dont see how it matters if I grind hard amp succeed financially to live a comfortable life vs just get by on the bare minimum with little effort. Im not sure what to do. What should my goals be. Id say naturally I want to find someonepeople to love but I always get hurt and the illusion of love shatters. Id like to have some people to spend time around but putting myself out there makes me feel like Im some unwanted human being. I feel like I should want to create this life where Im working towards a happy career amp finding and discovering hobbies but I just dont see the point. Idk if its depression, my mindset, fear, ect... The only thing I know is that Id like to make small changes to find fulfillment and contentment in my life so that I can move on with this chapter of my life. Anyone have advice?",
