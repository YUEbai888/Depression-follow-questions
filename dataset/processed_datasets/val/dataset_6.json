    "Should I see a doctor? Im showing some symptoms of depression like loss of appetite, insomnia, lack of motivation, etc. however I dont actually feel sad or suicidal in anyway. I feel like most of the symptoms are physical and not emotionally. Is this serious enough to consider going to a doctor? Im not even sure why Im getting these symptoms and idk if its even depression or not but my family is kinda concerned Sorry if I broke any subreddit rules, I just discovered this sub a few minutes ago I would appreciate any insightadvice",
    "How do I stop the fear of getting too attached to people? Hi everyone, A bit brave for posting this on my main, but here it goes. My attachment to people is a big issue. It has definitely led to heart ache, sadness, and disappointment. So  I got this great job a couple of months ago, every day was a challenge and something new. My colleagues are great people  I genuinely love speaking to them, and just overall having a good time. But  I have an issue of getting too attached to people and not interpreting signals correctly. This eventually leads to the other party to not dealing with me anymore I dont really blame them to be honest and just... cutting me off. This has eventually developed into me not opening up  or being personable with people as I am simply too scared of this attachment growing. Sometimes they message me out of work We all have each other on social media, big mistake on my end! and I just leave on seen or reply blandly, or sometimes in the middle of a conversation I just never reply, simply because I feel like this will go down the same road as before, just being too attached. Every day I struggle keeping myself composed I take photos just to get my head off things, this is the only thing that gets me going through the weekend. Should I tell this to my colleagues? Should I keep it a secret? I really dont know. At the end Im just not happy with how I am. I get suicidal ideations every single night and just remembering the relationshipsfriendships that I have fucked up literally gives me anxiety and it has definitely caused some sort of trauma. I dont go through with suicide because I just think of my parents on how sad they will be. But  once my parents pass away I am planning to fully commit as I really dont want to live this crippling anxiety with every single relationshipfriendship.",
    "I need help communicating with my depressed wife. How do I communicate with someone that will reject the behavior they just asked for?

    "Tonight was rough Idk if i should put a trigger warning on this, and tbh Im not really sure how too. So uh.... ! TRIGGER WARNING! If you struggles with eating disorders and suicidal ideation, uhm, this might be hard to read. Uhm. Idk if thats good or not. If not Im sorry. Truth be told if i dont get this off my chest now im afraid of what Ill do I cried so hard i threw up tonight. TBH it felt good. In a scary way. Due to depression and mental and emotional abuse, a few years ago I was severely malnourished. My hair was falling out. I had growths on the back of my tongue. My nails flaked a part. I stopped eating almost completely. Im now clinically obese. Not excessively so, but jumping from 130 to 230 in 3 months was a fucking wild ride. I dont want to go back to that place. Im gonna talk to my therapist about it in a few days, but I couldnt hold it in anymore. Im scared. Im scared of what Ill do to feel better, to hate myself less. Im also afraid of what Ill do if i dont stop hating myself. Im caught up in this cycle of oh itll get better, then it doesnt. And i spiral again. Please dont come back with comments like, get a gym member ship etc. I tried. It didnt work because I dont have the energy all the time, and then I beat myself up even more for not going. Im ending that cycle of self abuse before it can continue. I just dont know what to do anymore.",
    "I want to make a mental health channel on YouTube, but don't feel qualified... Let me start by saying, Im not in it for the views. Just that, recently I did a vlog after jotting down some things that help me when Im depressed. It felt sort of cathartic to write down things that help me, and hope it could help other people. My problem is I feel like what Ill contribute will be generic, or not very helpful since everyone deals with depression differently. ampx200B Im not making this post to advertise my channel. throwaway acc Im just unsure I should post because I dont feel quite qualified to talk about the content.

    "Weekly depression. Hey guys, Im new here. Im a 21 year old guy and I grew up in a pretty rough household. I had struggled with daily suicidal depression from the time of 1218. When I was 18 it got a little better and I went 89 months without having a though about suicide! During that time I had periods of feeling sad or down, but honestly not depressed? and its been periodical up until this last fall. Ive been struggling with suicidal thoughts for a couple of months and just recently I started realizing it becomes more prevalent toward the end of the weekweekend? Have you guys ever heard of something like that? Ill smile, and laugh and hangout with others, but in my thoughts Ill just be thinking about suicide? I hate feeling like that, as it becomes more prevalent I find myself getting less and less motivated as Ill gain weight and even lash out on people I love. Thank you.",
    "Do I have the right to be upset with my s/o for deciding to “taking a break” during a depressive episode? Im on mobile so please excuse the formatting. I have been dealing with depression for awhile. Ive been in a long term relationship for 3 years. Recently, he has told me he cant handle my episodes. I have mostly good days but still some bad days. Yesterday, I had an awful day. I couldnt get out of bed, and when I finally did I was felt like a zombie. I was extremely vulnerable, crying, and deeply sad. Yesterday he told me I was becoming too much to handle. Hes told me he doesnt have the capability to feel empathy, so every time I have an episode he thinks Im fighting with him. Ive told him multiple times Im having an internal battle that has nothing to do with him. My episode was stressing him out and he left. We live together and he went to stay with his cousin that lives 3 hours away. I dont want to be alone and Ive never felt so angry at myself for making him leave. I just need comfort and support. I dont know when hes coming back. I have never felt more alone. Am I overreacting?",
    "Is it worth trying more anti-depressants? Hey everyone, My depression has been out of control over the last year. Its always been bad, but this was the first year where I woke up nearly every day thinking about suicide. Ive been seeing a therapist for more than a decade and over that time Ive been talked into antidepressants several times. And without fail none of them helped. Prozac, Solexia, Welbutrin, and another Im blanking on all had no positive effect and untenable sexual side effects. This past year I tried Effexor and had to quit after a month or so because it made me feel emotionally numb and I felt no fear or concern about my growing desire to end my life. Now Im very apprehensive about even trying another SSRISNRI As of a few days ago I made one last try at maybe getting the Spravato treatment. But because I live in the worlds richest third world countrythe U. S., all of my prior SSRI experiences mean nothing. The insurance company requires that I endure at least 3 immediate attempts with drugs they want to cover before they even consider honoring the insurance that I pay them for. Has anyone similarly developed this apprehension towards antidepressants and eventually found one that worked? I was given a list of more modern SNRIs and Im fucking terrified that theyll make me feel like he last one and Ill give in and do it.",
    "Desperately need support Ive been struggling with mood and motivation problems for a long time but now this has been flowing over in back and joint problems, fatigue and some small signs of inflammation. My heads talking, dreaming and analyzing all the time, my memory and focus are down and just dont know what to do anymore. Some days all I can do is lay in bed and be anxious, other days Im full of energy and over enthusiasm with bad some nights rest as a result. Ive took my walks in nature, tried meditation for a long time, went to the spa and went to the gym. The gym helped me getting motivated, but later on gave me sleep, focus and fatigue problems. My heads full of memorys, hints and its all just like one big spiderweb. Meditation helped me with the sleep and focus problems, but I couldnt get to the core and discover what I really want. Im an epileptic and have PTSD and already have memory issues due to the epilepsy, so when Im at the psych I forget a lot of stuff andor forget to react to what the psych just said so I can complete the story. This has been going on for more than 2 years now and its wrecking my life apart. Im in physical pain, talk gibberish to others, Im hallucinating, Im more insecure than ever, talking to myself, have pushed all my friends and fun things aside thinking about death and suicide a lot, and already have solid plans for it and Im am afraid that my body is just breaking itself down somehow so there is no other way out than suicide. Its like a never ending circle and I want to get out as fast as possible. Any advice, tips, things I could do to make things better or just someone who wants to chat and lend a hand please be my guest, youre more than welcome.",
    "I’ve generally got a good life. Why am I still sad? Im 23, graduated from a great college, have a supportive family, no student debt, no huge skeletons in my closet. Im even engaged. I hate my job military and it stresses me out a lot which is part of it but other than that I dont know why sometimes I just feel like I cant get out of bed in the morning and I dont have any enjoyment in anything. I dont even like eating food any more and have lost about 20lbs in the past 2 months I dont have weight to lose currently Im 510 and 135lbs....

I dont know whats hit me today. Feeling hazy, disconected, lethargic. a malaise fog. Probably some of it from Methocarbamol Uses, Dosage amp Side Effects  Drugs.comhttpswww.drugs.commethocarbamol.html because I had slept in a shape sort of like a pretzel wensday after the gym. But today just have had no energy, uncomfortably disoriented to which in of it self is concerning. Binged a bunch of cookies listening to a hillarius rifftrax. And thats also frustrating because its so counter productive to getting weight down. Felt upset and weepy at how out of shape Ive gotten. One therapist thinks welbutrin would help, that does a number on my GI and makes me physically tense. My main one is at a loss.

    "I (m17) don’t feel like i have close connections to people; i’m semi-involved in multiple friend groups but i don’t feel like i can truly relate to any of them. am i just taking them for granted? i feel awful about it. starting around age 12 or maybe before but thats the age i can remember thinking ab this stuff ive been a very quiet and reserved person, never really tried to make new friends. ive always been liked by people though for whatever reason, so ive been friends with plenty of different people and different types of people. but i dont have a group of people who i feel like i can connect to. i feel like most of my friendships are relatively surfacelevel, especially when i see others around me who are all really close. now i know its not good to compare myself to other people, but i cant help doing it, its something my mind just does on its own. i am a naturally jealous person  one of the few people who i would consider closer than the rest of the people i talk to invited me to a discord server with a few people he knows irl and they all just seem to get along so well and have a real connection, but i basically never speak there. i feel so distanced. this same friend also keeps telling me about a girl who is a very close friend of his, and the stuff he tells me about just makes it seem like they really care about eachother. its obviously not intentional and im not mad about it, but it feels like a slap in the face because i have such a hard time forming relationships with people. i always feel bad when i feel this way too. like, i 100 recognize how lucky i am that so many people have taken a liking to me, when so many others like me didnt get that privilege. but i feel like its never enough for me. i feel so selfish. i dont even know why im writing this. i guess its some kind of cry for help? but whenever i write something like this i always look back and feel like ive done nothing but whine like a little bitch, and that if i actually tried to talk to anyone instead of crying on reddit i may actually be able to make good friends. i dont know.",
    "He said he has suicidal thoughts My boyfriend of 7 years and I recently broke up. He had been acting distant and cold for almost a year now. At first I thought he may be cheating or he simply just doesnt love me anymore. We started couples counseling together and he began opening up more and more. Things were great for about 6 months. Suddenly he just shut down again. But this time he was mean to me. He would say and do hurtful things. I didnt understand what was happening. He finally said he wasnt feeling himself. That he was a disappointment to everyone. He admitted he would purposely say or do hurtful things to me. And that he didnt know why or how to stop. So he broke up w me and moved out. He said he loves me but that I dont deserve this. I now now he is struggling w depression. I believe it started about a year ago. But I didnt realize till a few months ago. I tried to help but he just keeps pushing me away. He finished moving his stuff out yesterday. I send him a text telling him how much I love him, what a great guy he is, that I forgive him. Most importantly explaining to him that all the hurtful things he said and did where not his fault. Thats the thing about depression. It makes you act outside your character. I really wanted him to understand that his not a bad person. Anyway, he wrote back saying his just not ok. That he has even been having suicidal thoughts. It hurt so much to know he was feeling this bad. He promised he was going to seek professional help. Which is great. I hope he really does. But idk what to do with this information? He is a quite person. And it scares me that his thinking this way. Is there anything I can do? Is there anything I should do? Maybe let one of his family members know? Im really worried and scared for him. Any advice is appreciated.",
    "How do I stop myself from relapsing? Im posting this here because I asked this same thing in the rmentalhealth subreddit and no one answered so maybe you guys can help Ive been struggling with depression and anxiety for almost all my life, but these past few months had been especially hard. When I go through these depressive episodes I tend to procrastinate a lot, I dont have the energy to clean my house or do my work. And this is obviously making me have consequences at my job, Im scared Im gonna get fired, all of this is just making me feel worse. So I started seeing a therapist who has been helping a lot, but she told me it was normal to relapse and that recovery is not linear, I started working better and I cleaned everything. My routine went back to normal for a couple of weeks, but since two days ago Im going through another depressive episode, and again, I dont have the energy to do anything, I havent been able to work at all. What can I do about this? Do you have any advice for me? I dont mind mentally relapsing and feeling sad, I can deal with that, but I need to keep my life going and keep my routines intact or at least functional.",

I know its kinda childish but I hate the taste of toothpaste and struggle with focusing on it, even though it only takes two minutes.

    "I need ideas.... I know most of you are going to say that I need to volunteer, and while that is a good idea and was doing that briefly in the past before they got rid of me because they needed to use me more than I could offer, I am currently recovering from a series of 3 surgeries, and am not really at a point where I can feel comfortable leaving the house and volunteering like that  if I could even find something youd be surprised how hard it was for me to find something in the first place. Having said that, I do agree that I need to get out of the house, my big qualms with that are that 1 most of the time I need to kill is during the day  when most, contributing members of society who arent drains on the economy like I believe myself to be, are at work, and I have a severe lack of interests. Im interested in sports and watching t.v. and movies and surfing the internet like I said....and thats about it. I dont read I find reading to be somewhat difficult and as a result, a chore, I hate listening to music due to my shitty taste in music as all the bandsgenres I liked growing up have all died out and my tastes never matured, I cant cook to save my life.....like its so bad Im afraid Im going to seriously hurt myself burnset myself on fire, cut a finger off, etc., Ive got like 3 friends and a fourth I see once in a blue moon I ever see on any sort of regular basis two of which are married, but are often busy with work and married life, theyre new house, and are about to have a baby, etc. I wish I had more, but I made only 1 friend in college that I stayed in touch with, and the other two are a HIGH SCHOOL friend and his wife. I guess I just never really learned HOW to make friends and it doesnt help that Ive developed crippling social anxiety when it comes to new social situations or environments. Its gotten so bad and Im so isolated due to my myriad of circumstances, that I have gotten into the habit of trying to make online friends via things like Reddit, but that only does but so much for socialization and killing time.",
    "I haven’t been myself since 2020. Will I ever go back to normal or should I just give up on life? I was a straight A college student and part time EMT. Now Im an unemployed college dropout living at my parents house. I gained 40 pounds and stopped enjoying my usual activities. I feel like I go from doctor to doctor and none of them give a shit about any of this. The depression started very suddenly in January of 2021 and its gotten progressively worse ever since then. Things completely spiraled out of control in October because thats when I distanced myself from all of my friends. Ive been on 20mg lexapro for several years and I just switched to trintellix a month ago. But Trintellix makes me feel awful. If anything, Im worse off than I was before. I have slight brain fog constantly. I have emotions again, which is good, but theyre all negative. Im just sad and angry 247. I went to the doctor again today because they said I had minor hypothyroidism the last few times I got blood work done. Hopefully Ill get medicated for that. I just feel powerless. Im like a victim of my own mind. Before this very sudden bout of depression, I was so happy and excited about life. Now its as if I have no future because I cant control my depression and no one is helping me to do so. I havent been myself since 2020. I dont know what to do. Side note I started taking adderall in January and thats when I started getting depressed. Any correlation?",
    "How to help my husband not feel like he’s useless against my depression Ive been depressed for a long time now. Ive been struggling for as long as hes known me and it hasnt gotten any better throughout the course of our time together. Recently, hes been feeling like hes useless and cant do anything to help me when Im feeling really down and hes getting really frustrated. Needless to say this puts a strain on our relationship and how we communicate with each other. I dont know how to help him help me. Ive told him I just need him to be supportive and compassionate and loving but it frustrates him when he does that and Im still depressed. I think he understands that my mental health cant be fixed in a day but I hate that I make him feel like this. Has anyone been through something similar? How did you get throughmanage it?",
    "How can I convince my friend who is struggling with depression to seek help or let me help him? So basically my friend 16 who well call joe has been struggling with depression for months now. He used to be very open with me about it, and would frequently vent to me about his problems. About a month back, joe was at his worst, and he cut himself. I understandably was very concerned at this and brought up the idea of seeing a professional who can help him. He wasnt very open to the idea and I think me mentioning it made him feel I was worrying too much about him, because now it seems hes telling me less and less every time I ask him how he is doing. The other day his mental health came into the conversation and he told me he has no idea why he feels so bad all the time. I tried to pry a little bit, but he made it clear he doesnt want to talk to me about it because 1. He doesnt want me to worry about him, and 2. I wouldnt get it. Fair enough... so I told him he should see a professional who can help figure out why he feels bad all the time. He said he was too scared to see a professional, which I completely understand so I offered to help him find someone. He flat out said no and changed the subject. I think joe is depressed and most certainly in denial about it. Hes told me hes not depressed, just sad, but he doesnt know why hes sad. He obviously wont talk to me anymore about it, and hes scared to find someone who can help him. It would be extremely beneficial for him to talk to someone who is trained to diagnose mental illnesses, or can at least help him understand why he feels like this. So how can I convince joe to either find someone who can professionally help him or let me help him find that person? Thanks Im advance for any feedbackadvice",
    "Nothing makes me happy anymore This year has been pretty rough for me. I had complications with an IUD I had put in and needed surgery to remove it as Ithe doctor put it in wrong. I had a scare with mold damage to where I was living, I threw out a bunch of clothes and had to wash everything in hot. I had a scare with bed bugs and had to freeze everything and dry in hot. I broke up with my boyfriend because he didnt want to see me anymore. I have had a lot of health problems and the doctors think I might have something serious I worry that its cancer. The only thing good going for me is my grades and thats because I literally put any energy I have that doesnt go towards aimlessly panicking and googling whatever my mind wants to worry over towards my grades. Lately I am in a endless state of paindue to my medical problems and I just dont feel happy anymore. I remember two years ago when I was actually happy and I was able to laugh at things or feel content. I just feel weird. My days are lonely... I dont have a boyfriend, family, friends,pets. My family lives far away, I wish I saw them more...but im too poor to travel. I just leave the house to go to school, come home, take tylenol then study. I got a scholarship which should have made me happy but I just didnt feel anything. My first thought was actually well if I have cancer this scholarship wont really matter. I keep thinking that im not going to live for very long. When people talk to me or try to make jokes I force a smile and it feels so weird because Im focusing on trying to look normal and happy so people cant see that im actually emotionless. How I am is starting to scare me a little bit like Im worried it might get worse. I tried seeing the school counseller but that didnt really help me as it made me uncomfortable talking about my anxiety.",

    "Low-functioning Depression &amp; Exercise Ive struggled with depression for quite a while now, and certain times I find motivation comes easier than others. However, for the past three months I have been at a very low point, I shower once a week and I struggle to brush my teeth and hair. Thats where Im at. Last July I started seeing a personal trainer for the goal of weight loss and I havent seen her for 6 weeks now. My mom is encouraging me to go back, for my mental healths sake, but right now I have no interest in exercise. Also, I fear that if I go back my goal of weight loss will prioritize over my goal of benefiting my mental health. I know I inevitably kick myself for not going back, but the dread is over powering my rationale. I would prefer to just to 10 minute workouts on my own in my pyjamas, but I know I probably wont. Personal training just seems like a lot. What should I do? If you have been or know someone who is lowfunctioning, has personal training been helpful? Or exercise in general? Is it better to start small when youre low functioning or just throw yourself in? I appreciate any thoughts and advice as really I only have my moms perspective right now and she doesnt totally understand the depressed brain. Thank you",

We parted though and now, years later, I still have never had what I had with her. She made me feel like I could do...anything. I didnt fully understand back then but I know now that I loved her and still do somehow... I havent seen her in years now but she plagues my dreams and I think about her daily.

    "When to walk away.. Hi, I 29F have been seeing someone 29M who suffers from depression and anxiety. Right now it seems like his depression has gotten worse where he has a low sex drive, sleeps all day, is gaining weight and has started smoking again. Hes told me he wants to stop seeing me but when I ask him how come he just says he doesnt know or is overwhelmedconfused. And that he thinks he doesnt like me the way he thought he did when we first met. Ive kind of tried to get him to elaborate but he said theres no point in evaluating it. I was hurt but in the back of my head I cant help but think is he self sabotaging? Is this his depression thats overwhelming him and clouding his judgment? I asked him if he was pushing me away because he didnt like me anymore or if he was too overwhelmed. He said he wasnt trying to push me away but that hes not well atm. I told him I cared about him and that Ill respect his boundaries and give him space for now. But after reading posts on this sub Im even more confused, should I give him the space he says he wants or should I continue to try and be there for him physically and emotionally? Am I being naive?

    "Feeling Super Stuck - Would Love Some Advice Hey guys. Im posting this in the depression forum because Im hoping for some advice from people who know what its like to live with depression. Im stuck in a bad situation with no good options, and I think it would be difficult for anyone without including severe depression and anxiety, but Ive got that too. Also, I just think I need some compassion and understanding right now, and so this feels like the right place to post this. TLDR Im a Canadian living in Houston. My wife is finishing up her surgical fellowship, and because of Covid, getting my US work authorization is taking forever. The combination of unemployment and being in a toxic relationship has left me miserable and fighting with depression and anxiety. If we didnt have a two and half year old daughter I would have split with my wife a while ago. Without employment I cant afford to get my own place here, and staying in this relationship is killing my soul. Im feeling insanely stuck  any advice? Long version Im living in Houston with my wife and two and half yearold daughter. My wife is a surgical fellow, and is currently deciding on which of the three job offers she has to become a full staff doctor in one of three US cities. I sold my business back in Canada earlier this year, and because of Covid and probably the existing general slowness of the US government, getting my US work authorization is taking forever. Im likely going to have to wait another three or four months until Im able to work, and at that point Ill still have to find a job. Unfortunately, as soon as my wifes current job is over in June, Ill have to stop working immediately, and will have to reapply for US work authorization again when she gets her new visa issued. So optimistically Ill be able to work for four out of the next 12 months and while Im a highly qualified person, I may not be able to find a wellpaying job right away. Working remotely for a Canadian company is possible, but those jobs pay poorly and theyre surprisingly hard to come by.

It lists all these requirements and job descriptions and I dont know if I can do all that. I understand that the job would train you a bit and not just leave you out to dry. But when I read the job description the image in my head is of a hard diligent worker that shows up at 7am sharp and works through the entire day until 3pm with not a second wasted. Laser focused for the entire day. Or that I just wouldnt be able to pick up the job and perform well enough. Im scared as fuck. I got a phone call from a staffing agency which is probably going to be a dead end and Im terrified to call them back.",
    "I don’t know what’s going on They never felt depressed, they never looked back, they just worked and kept going. And thats why Im trying so hard to just be so strong and try to not let depression just get in my way,because they had it worst than I did and they achieved so much. But its so hard. Nobody hits my phone up, asking me whats up, or how Ive been. And if they do, if I say horrible or try to talk to them, theyre gonna be like oh sorry man, hope you feel better. No one is there to understand me, or take the time to really care. Friends? What friends? All of them are horny simps. They would talk behind my back if it meant they could keep the conversation going longer with girls, and trust me its happened on more than one occasion. Theyre all dicks. Im supposed to pretend to be fine and happy and chill, or else Ill be judged for being in my feelings. Theyll say Im on my man period or something. I dont have friends, and Ive been trying to distance myself from the people I hang out with. How do they do it? They all loook so happy. Messing around with girls, being happy with their girlfriends. Theyre all so happy to have each other man. Theyre so tight. And Im not part of their deep circle. I dont want to be. I dont want to be like them. And I have no deep circle of my own. I have no one who has my back. A lot of my friends just use me to cover for them if they didnt finish their homework. I got the captaincy on my soccer team. I know many of those friends who are my teammates have been plotting and feinding behind my back. Ive tried talking to girls, but I lose interest real quick because I know i wont get anything deep with them, I wont have a real connection with them, because I feel like I cant trust them. I feel like I cant trust anyone. They cant understand me. They cant understand what Im going through.",
    "Help finding therapist Hi everyone. First time posting here and looking to see if anyone has any advice. This is not a throw away because I dont care what people think about me. I suffer from highly functional depression. I have been seeing a psychiatrist and am currently on medication, which helps, but still have bad days. I have seen a psychologist in the past, middle aged male, that I couldnt open up to. After seeing him for 2 years I stopped going because of work change. My spouse, primary care, and psychiatrist all urge me to find someone to talk to. I thought long and hard and realized the personality of someone that I could open up to. With all this being said, is there a good way to search for local therapists online in your area? I tried a few months back and could only find older individuals. I need someone closer to my age 36 as I feel it would allow me to open up more. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.",

Im not even sure if our insurance covers mental health visits. If it doesnt I cant afford it, I have no money of my own. According to my parents this sadness is punishment for my past sins, if I didnt do so many bad things I wouldnt be feeling this way now. 3 years ago I begged my parents to take me to a psychologist and my parents were shocked and said our daughter is not crazy and shut down the topic as quickly as they could.

    "I need ideas.... Im about to be 33 years old, have never been able to get a job due to a lack of abilityskills and the fact that I was born with disabilities  the big one being a developmental disability Spina Bifida.

Anyway, outside of forcing myself to TRY to learn skills that I have absolute interest in whatsoever and am convinced are still far from any sort of guarantee of being able to land me a job, what can I do to stave off intense boredom everyday, repeating the same routine of sitting on my fat, lazy, SEVERELY work ethiclacking ass all day doing nothing but watching t.v. which sucks during the daytime when all it is  is repeats ive seen dozens of times, and surfing the internet which Ive done so much by now that Im actually bored of the internet to some degree LOLSMHFML.

    "The Story of This Year Im a 22yo male and Ive been struggling with depression and anxiety since before I can even remember. I was put into the foster care system in Australia when I was 3 and stayed there till I was 18. Thankfully I didnt cycle a lot like most kids and I found a foster family who I now call my real family. Im having a really difficult time at the moment, this year had been really really tough. Im in my 4th year of uni and Ive failed the last 2 years because of my mental state, Ive been seeing counsellors and doctors and Im on medication. 2 weeks ago I got diagnosed with Bipolar II and now been medicated for that. But I just need to vent so Im going to talk about my year and hows its been the worst and best year Ive had in a very long time. So the best year started on the 31st of December 2018. I was at college by myself over Christmas and in news years eve I wanted to spend it with someone because I couldnt with my foster family. I invited 2 friends that were in my town at the time who came over. We sat and chatted for an hour and they started to get bored, my mate asked if he could invite a friend over to join us, I agreed. This friend ended up bringing a fair few people, I would say around 10. Me being anxious as all shit over everything in life, freaked out and stayed silent. I ended up having a few drinks and with each one became more confident and less anxious. Turns out these people were pretty amazing, I made a friend who was 7ft tall and he was honestly the big friendly giant. I made another friend who Ill call Max, we hit it off straight away and Ive never connected so well with someone. We instantly became best friends, he stayed over my place for an entire month until we decided to move out with 2 of our other friends, one of those who was homeless and was desperately trying to find someone to live. A little back story before we get rocky, I lived at a university where at the time our flat 8 bedroom house sorta thing was located on campus. All 8 people were and still are my closest friends. They are a very important part of my life and they mean the world to me.",
    "How should I do this 'homework' from a therapist We talked for 20 minutes about problems Ive had about my appearance and being bullied for being ugly for aroun 15 years now and he seemed to think by the end of the conversation that I was healed.

I tried hard to overcome the immense cringe I wanted to react with but I just feel like Im being picky. He said for the second task to tell the people I ask its for a uni project. I really appreciate this as a cobverup but I just dont think itll wash. Anyone male in my family would cringe like mad at being asked to describe another guy in three words, and my mates, well... you expect a group of lads to give serious answers to that their sense of humour is appreciated, it just wouldnt make this task possible? ampx200B I really dont want to disappoint the therapist I already struggle to know what the correct answer is to his questions during sessions, and I can tell he thinks Im weird. I desperately want to get better  this has been going in since I was 10  and Ive tried counselling twice before. I was going to try medication which all counsellors Ive met have told me not to, but with no reasons given but cant now as the health servcie is so overworked right now. Also there is one thing I want to discuss with the counsellor really badly sexual abuse when I was a child, sorry if TMI, but he said in our first meeting that its an ethics violation. I cant afford a proper counsellor this is free through uni Im aware how priviledged I am and I am sorry that Im just complaining so Id appreciate any advice on how I could work through this. Thank you, and sorry again that I am complaining.",

I have always been a very emotional person and I experience a lot of mood swings. So lately i have been quite down and stressed as I am very anxious about my careerstill clueless. and as a result I havent been able to control my emotions. It feels like Im walking on thin ice and anyone,literally anyone, can make a small remark and shatter and Im back to drowning in a cold sea of emotions. I spend a lot of time crying. I just have no control over it. I want to stop crying, i tell my self to stop crying and i cant and its so goddamn frustrating. It makes me feel weakI am already physically weak and underweight. I know expressing emotions and letting it out is healthy, but what if you are feeling so emotionally saturated with all the self hate and worries that youd cry to anything. I at least wish i had enough control so i wouldnt cry in front of someone who is not close. but nope. I have zero control. let me quote this one incident. a few days ago, I snapped at my elder brother when he was pressuring me to do learn things for my career. He kept forcing his point and it made me feel small and incompetent and like he doesnt trust my decisions on what I wanted to learn so I began to get all defensive and I very rudely told him off and avoided him ever since.

    "Should I kill myself? I am the most uninteresting person and I feel like I am the only one who puts effort into any of my relationships. I actually am in a relationship though, we started dating in april. Its a ldr though, and her timezone is 14 hours ahead. It was pure infatuation at the start, we both felt so confident about the relationship. She had plans to move to the same city as me, we had so much in common. We were both sort of shy and laid back. Though as I got more comfortable my extroverted side came out. I think I smoothered her too much though, I always complimented her and tried to tell her itll be okay and I am eilling to wait for borders to lift to meet her. She liked it so I kept doing it, but I think the repetitiveness, lack of physical touch, and my neediness eventually became unattractive. It became the norm. I was always there for her when she needed to talk, and we kept talking about how we are going to meet as soon as borders go up. It was hard to keep interesting and we didnt know what else to do. Then in the last month, things started getting hard for me at work and in my family, I opened up about insecurities about my mom health as she was diagnosed with cancer, and how I feel I have to work on my confidence. I think this must have really been a turn off. She has become more and more distant this past month. She still says shes into me but she doesnt talk about the future as much and is not nearly as affectionate as before. She has said she doesnt know how much longer she can do ldr, but shes willing to keep trying a little longer for me. But it feels like she isnt putting any effort and idk, the relationship doesnt feel secure and loving anymore. I talked to her about it and she said she really likes me, but she feels so distant. Idk what I can do to help this or if theres anything. I really like her, like we never fought, and we really matched. I loved gsming with her, or playing piano for her.",
    "Alone I really need some help, I cant sleep anymore, I feel like I want to die but I dont have enough motivation, Im slowly losing all of my interests and everything hurts, my body is in constant physical and mental pain, I never feel any positive emotions anymore, if I feel it for even a second a day its an honest achievement but I have nowhere to go for this, I dont want to dump this on the people I care about, because it would be awful to do considering people are dealing with their own problems, but I just need someone to talk to, especially knowing Im not the only one out there that feels like this is a slight relief knowing that Im not completely alone in this world, and if youve read all the way through to here thank you, and I hope you are doing well, and if you need someone to talk to, Ill listen to me if youll listen to me .

    "How will I ever know if I’m well enough for a relationship? Ive been suffering from depression for as long as I can remember and suicidal thoughts for the past 4 years they started around the time I was about to enter uni. One thing that I have always believed is that, before I even consider any sort of romatic relationship, I need to work on bettering my mental health drastically and thus gain enough emotional maturity. However, Ive failed to define how much emotionally maturity is just enough for me to start considering myself worthy of a relationship. Thanks to a supportive family, medication and plenty of therapy, Ive bettered myself far beyond what I thought I was capable of. I havent had serious suicidal thoughts in a couple of months and Ive been able to confront situations which before wouldve emotionally crippled me for weeks. I still have a lot to work on, specially in terms of social skills, but atleast I can find some joy in my day to day life. So my question is how will I ever know when Ill be mentally stable enough for me to even consider seeking a relationship? Or am I just overthinking all of this? For context Im 21 M English isnt my first language, so Im sorry if my sentence structure is a bit wonky.",
    "School Dropout Hey everyone, Ive recently lost around 100 pounds it happened right when I dropped out of school, I havent been the same since Ive been staying home. Im 18 now and everyday is a chore, you think Id be happy now that Ive lost weight but I have extra skin and that makes me feel like Im the same person I was before I lost weight. I look in the mirror and hate so many parts of myself even though my parents and friends say I look good and that the things I see arent true. How can I get out of this funk?",

I have exams currently and I cant study for more than 20 minutes without taking a 4 hour break. Any task that I need to do is dwelled over for hours on end before actually being done. I dont have any courage, any willpower, any energy whatsoever. I feel lost and dont know how I can stop being like this. Theres so much other stuff wrong with me I havent said here. Ive also thought about suicide quite a bit. Doubt Id actually follow through with it, but the thoughts are there.",

    "Everything Feels Too Overwhelming I feel overwhelmed at the slightest things. This has been happening for a long, long time but it just keeps getting worse. Some days are better than others. Today is a bad day. I quite my job in January to live my dream of being a fulltime artist. I am failing so hard. Yes, COVID really impacted everything but if Im being completely honest, I was never cut out for this to begin with. Ive taken on commissioned work that is months overdue because the thought of starting is so overwhelming. I keep telling myself, tomorrow I will start and I feel relieved. I wanted to make art today first time in months and even got excited at the idea of going to the art store, but then I just thought it will just be another piece that sits there and goes unfinished. I killed all of my excitement before I even did anything. This isnt me. I used to love to create art more than anything and spent almost every spare second painting. I havent started and I feel guilt and shame everyday. I feel stuck. I cant start and I feel like absolute shit for my behaviour. I also run an online vintage shop. I built the new website back in February and was SO proud and excited about it. I havent touched it since. I want to, I want to work on it, but now I have SO many pieces of clothing that need to be cleaned, photographed, listed, measured, that its again....overwhelming. I cant bring myself to start and just look at all the beautiful clothing just sitting there every single day. Some days I scroll through my phone for hours because Im looking for a sign or a solution. Im wasting my life. I hate feeling this way. I hate living this way. Im unhappy no matter what I do and Im feeling SO much guilt for letting so many people down. Im 30 years old too old to be acting this way. Its so shameful. I also keep thinking that its too late for me to make any changes. Whats the point in trying to do better if I havent already figured it out by now.",
    "I just someone to hold me. I don’t know anymore. Its been a month since my partner of 10 years left me out of no where on my birthday. Just had their bags packed and said Im leaving. I have no closure and still dont even know what happened. She was physically and emotionally abusive to me but never told anyone about it on account of how emasculating it feels. I dont know how you tell people your female partner punches you at home during arguments. She begged me to go to therapy for years and started to with covid, I worked so hard to become a better person and mentally healthy and she hated that version of me. Now Im a waste of life in their 30s with no reason to live. She took all my friends with her and I just dont have anyone anymore. I drove cross country to be with family to try to sort myself out, but was quickly reminded why I dont spend much time with my family as its only made my mental health worse. I was happier alone with my dog in my car with no where to go or anything. Ive stopped taking my medication and have been drinking heavily, which I hadnt done for a year really. I took my last Ativan today and its been the only thing keeping me from going off the deep end. I doubt my psychiatrist will prescribe more so it just seems like the end to me. I think for some people suicide is their lifes purpose and I feel like I am finally becoming content with that. But I cant even talk like this openly with my therapist or psychiatrist out of fear of just being committed. I know my self and know I will just lie to get out of there too and will only drive me further to killing myself. I just dont understand why people I thought loved me want to hurt me so badly. I guess I just have bad karma and have done something to deserve this so I feel like nature is just telling me its time to die. I dont expect any one to respond or even read this. I just have no one.",

I do them and I dont feel anything  no surprise, no fascination, no hatred. My friends talk around me about their passions, their dreams and I feel I have no direction and also I feel everything is pointless. Even the field I study in College is not so fascinating or surprising, its just decent and I can learn that quantify of information.

I tried being consistent with going outside a lot of times before but I always found myself stopping after maybe 3 or 4 days. But this time I managed to keep it up for a month and I definitely like its an accomplishment, at least. At first it was hard to get used to but after a week I felt somewhat okay with it and no longer felt like I was forcing myself to do it. But now I just cant help but wonder why Im doing any of it. It doesnt really make me feel any better. Im still the depressed old me. And its not like I lost some weight either.

    "What’s ACTUALLY going to make me not depressed anymore? It’s been 3+ years of clinical depression and I’m only getting worse. I genuinely don’t want to live anymore. I fucked up big time. Im only 20 but these past couple years I havent felt like I lived my life properly. Ive been floating through everything and I no longer have a life worth living. Its been years of not being able to get much pleasure out of things. Ive now reached peak depression because I no longer have any hobbies or interests, goals and passions, I dont feel the need to socialize and make friends anymore, I dont do anything with my life and I gave up trying because my mind and body did years ago. Ever since getting out of high school I havent thought of anything to do with my life because my depression has gotten so bad that theres no point in trying anymore because all I see is darkness. Im not good enough I feel, and that anything I do isnt good enough so why try. The pandemic has made things much worse and Ive already had a suicide attempt back in November, and Im still suicidal since my last attempt, and I have a strong feeling that I wont live long because my depression has made it so that the pain is overtaking the will the live any longer. These past 4 years, Ive only had a few days where I felt okayish, but 99.9 of these days out of 4 years have been depression, so I feel that its not worth living anymore. I dont know how to get out of this mess. Nothing is enjoyable anymore. Ive tried multiple antidepressants and therapy hasnt been working so far. Im isolated and suicidal. Im afraid Ill always be this way so I want to stop living. My negative thoughts keep me even more depressed because the future just seems to be more depressing and lonely. So why live it. What is going to make me not depressed if I have been consistently clinically depressed for over 3 years? 3 mother fucking years and this shit hasnt went away. Im losing value in life, it feels like a shitty game thats no longer enjoyable and Ill gladly stop playing it. Life feels like a joke to me now, I just cant live anymore.",

    "How to come back? Around the middle of 2020, I had a huge mental breakdown like I never had in my life, isolated myself, move out of the city for emotional and financial reasons, and shut down communication with my friends. Wont tell the whole story here, as I already posted it, but after treatment and just passing time Im now ready to go back to the city, but the idea of confronting my friends and their questions spikes my anxiety. It is obvious theyre going to ask WTF happened to me, why did I disappear, what have I been doing and honestly I dont know what the fuck am I going to do. Some of my closest friends were trying to reach me out while I was in the middle of my breakdown last year, and when I finally spoke to them and told them what happened they were understanding, but THEY ARE my closest friends. I feel like I can share ugly, intimate details with them. I dont know if I can do that with other people. I cant imagine myself being at a party or something and telling everyone I had a chill gap year I wish. I cant lie. And yet I want to not give a fuck about what other people think, I dont want their opinions and their fake sympathy cause they never called, and will never call after this. I sometimes wish I was more of an asshole and straight tell them its none of their business and I dont feel like talking about it with them, but thats not me, although being honest the breakdown and the pandemic made more cold and bitter so I dont know On the other hand, I wonder if some of them are mad because I gave zero explanations for my disappearance? Would you take it personally? Is that fair? Do you have some words for me? Id really appreciate it.",
    "I depress my partner... My partner and I have been together for 11 years now. Were very much alike and most times, thats great. Except for one. We both suffer from depression. Different reasons sprouting from different childhood crap, but the end result is the same both of us lying in bed for a few days under the covers. The problem is, I think my partner is an emotional sponge, because it almost ALWAYS works out that I get depressed first and then he will too, just two days behind. Its gotten to the point that Im getting really intense anxiety over getting depressed myself because I dont want to do that to him. It feels like something Im inflicting on him and then leaving him out to dry cuz Im still screwed up. Im there for him when hes depressed, no question. But anyone who has had depression knows youre not 100 when in the middle of it, and it seems so unfair to me that hes the strong one for me but then doesnt get the same level of help when he goes under. Its like I get someone to lean on but then he only gets someone to wallow with. He says thats all he wants, just some company and reassurance. But its hard to really hear that I was raised by narcissists and its still hard to really accept that I dont have to be on top ofam not to blame for other peoples emotional state. I just want some advice on how to better deal with the anxious thoughts surrounding this so I dont feel like its something Im putting him through, or maybe just some general ideas of how to better be there for him when Im depressed too. The best Ive come up with is focusing on the fact that we always make it out the other side together, but this anxiety is really getting the best of me this time.",
    "Help me, please. I have 0 friends in the literal sense. I have been living like this for more than 3 years I try to contact my first and old friends in Facebook and although they enthusiastically answer we can never get together, and even if we could I would be so embarassed to share with them what my life has become. I have learned to live with it, especially after I got psychological support for some months last semester and even if talking to a therapist was a great relief I felt it was useless. When I was in therapy I was reading at the same time some books of selfimprovement but that only created in me a temporary but potent energy and when this energy disappeared I returned to this drab, insipid state. I was in a very decent social circle when I was in school I am not from the US so this will be difficult to explain, I studied where the rich people and the children of important persons of my country studied so I had what you call good connections and in here you start with the same classmates when you are 3 years old and end with the same classmates when you are 1718 so we graduate very close to each other emotionally. I feel like I have left that circle and I cant return, I dread that situation of me presenting myself again to those persons and it feels that as years pass they get closer together while I isolate myself more. My mom always says that University is the best time of the life because you party, go with friends are more independent, and you begin to flourish, grow up and create good or bad experiences. Not for me, I feel like I am in standby, I just watch people have fun. Today I observed my classes to see if there was anyone else like this but everyone had at least one person to talk to. You may say that it is ok to not party if you dont like although I do like to party from times to times and get drunk, its just there isnt anybody I can do that with and even if I didnt like to go to clubs I see everyone with different interests and mindsets forming groups according to what they like, WHY DO I FEEL LIKE I AM NOT PART OF ANY GROUP???

Lately she has been getting rid ofblocking out people who are helping her, which is why Im glad I convinced her to let me talk to her about this tomorrow, but anyways she convinced her stupid ass useless parents that she doesnt need a therapist anymore, she doesnt tell her doctor anything, she doesnt open up to her parents understandable because they get mad or brush it off. Dude FUCK them honestly and shes even blocked me a couple times for spam calling her when she attempted to cut herself 134 deep wound cuts caused by an army knife her dumbass parents never took away btw because I couldnt reach her and her parents for SOME reason trust her home alone and shes pushed away friends too. So with all this information, can someone please give me advice on what I need to address, how I should go about it, and what I should suggest she needs help for like therapist, family therapy, psychologist, etc.?

    "Those who’ve dealt with it longer than I - how? So Im a 20 y.o. F whos currently on her sophomore year in college. I was diagnosed with severe depression and a panic attack disorder about two years ago. Since then Ive dealt with two changes in medication, a suicide attempt and moving away to my own apartment and away from all my family and friends. Since starting school Ive realized Ive become incredibly isolated. The only time Ill have human touch is when my boyfriend visits me for the weekend, and unless a professor or a group member speaks to me, generally throughout the day I wont have a conversation with anyone. Even my parents dont talk to me everyday. Ive joined a DnD group and have made attempts to push myself out of this crippling isolation but how do you make friends when more than have your days are bad mental health days? My depression has worsened significantly since moving and to help myself I got a 3 month old puppy that Im training to be my service animal. Honestly, that baby is most of the reason I get out of bed as puppies dont care if you have depression  they need to be trained. Ive also made another doctors appointment to see about yet another med adjustment. I also got in contact with a therapist but I honestly dont see how it will help much being as though I can only go to one session a month. I just dont know how Im supposed to live like this? Like is this going to be my life from now on just barely struggling by with less than a hand full of people who would actually give a shit if I failed miserably?

And I dont think theyll be any help. How can I quit because I dont think I can do it alone. Ive been trying for a while now, but the moment I fail or I am under stress, I just revert to cutting. I would even go with scratching myself to the point of drawing blood if I didnt have a blade on hand or other if people could notice if I had a blade like in school. Help me. Please.",
    "Thought I would share this here Hi, my name is Sebastian and I really dont know how to start this post, maybe because Im afraid to be called whiny or whatever, but the truth is Ive been feeling pretty down recently so I thought I would share what Ive been feelingthinking this past 3 months or so. It is a well known fact that 2020 has been nothing short of horrible, but the reality is that, for me at least , it didnt start that way. Beginning of 2020 was maybe the best Ive ever felt in my life. To provide a little more context, Im 19 rn, but back at January February I was still 18 and about to graduate from high school which I eventually did, with good grades, but heres the issue I graduated from a international German school which educates based on the German system Abitur which in short were some difficult exams that I studied my ass of to pass. Abitur also presented me with the possibility of going abroad for college. All my short life Ive felt kinda pressured to go abroad to study, since my father did it and always talked about how amazing it was, and my school was filled with posters of study in Europemostly Germany its a life changing experience. And so I felt on top of my game and started among at the very top architecture in such places like Madrid,Berlin,Stuttgart,etc but most of all I wanted Barcelona because it felt so perfect on paper, like the best of the best , world wide known, top level technology, state of the art campus, and of course the city itself is an architectural delight arguably the most famous architect , Gaudí is from Barcelona. Looking back now, I was naive and didnt appreciate what I had back home , but I had to prove the ones who bullied and looked down on me back in my school days , that I was better than them, and that was my first of many mistake I went there looking for revenge so to speak. Then everything developed so quickly I had barely any time to think , to my awe I got accepted in BarcelonaTech, I found a nice little bedroom on a student housing that was just beside Campus and I started preparing for my departure , which was going to be mid September bc the University had arranged some introdution activities for new comers. It all seemed perfect, like it was made FOR me.",

    "Should I get myself checked in to a psychiatric ward so they can force me to start my antidepressant? Im having a hard time. My anxiety skyrocketed. Im going through an IBS flare up. I havent had a colonoscopy or gastroscopy yet, but Ive had blood tests, stool tests, ultrasonography and MRI done. All perfectly normal. So there is still a possibility that its something else but its not very likely. Every time I have to poo I get an anxiety attack. I think its a mild one because I dont lose control or pass out, but I get this surge of absolute despair, racing thoughts, I start the breathe shallowly, I start to shake, cold sweats, weird muscle spasms in my body etc. I mean it might be mild but it doesnt feel mild really. Since I poo everyday I get these attacks everyday, sometimes multiple times, sometimes not even triggered by having to poo. A slightly weird feeling in my stomach can cause me to spiral into an anxiety attack. Ive been prescribed Effexor along with Remeron, Ive already been on Remeron but as you can guess I dont think it has any effect on me anymore. It used to work though, it didnt help me too much but I was feeling better. This was a year ago of course. Since then it lost its effectiveness. My psych warned me that I shouldnt look up Effexor online. Unfortunately she was too late since I research antidepressants a lot I already knew its side effects, how does it feel while starting, how shitty the withdrawals are etc. I said ok, because I was desperate. But there is a problem. Its been a while, and I cant bring myself to take my medication. And I know that I have to take it, because there isnt much else left to try. This is not just my opinion, my psych said it herself. So I have to get better. I have to take my medicine to get better, but Im scared of it. The more scared I get the worse my anxiety gets.",

I dont understand what I can do to have a normal life and nobody will help. Everyone says I just have to wait and be patient and people will come, but they havent, and life doesnt wait for anybody. All this time keeps ticking and going down the drain and Ive missed out on so much. I am 25 now and still havent even learned how to be a teenager or had any teenage friends or teenage life experiences yet, but now Im too old to even have those experiences and have completely missed out on everything. I cant even get therapy because they said I have to have at least 1 hour a week of social interaction for 6 months before they will even consider a rereferral, which is a completely impossible goal. I spend like 1216 hours a day, begging and begging for people to be in my life, even offering them money, but literally not one person will hang out with me, even once. They all assume somebody else will but nobody does. I dont know what to do. Im so lost and theres not one person I can ask for help. No family members, no friends, no idea how to get them in the first place. Youve got to have people to get people and Im just stuck in this cycle of isolation. Speaking to people on the internet is like speaking to bots who all copy and paste the same useless things, put yourself out there join a group etc etc, Ive already done it for years and years and years and and none of it has worked. I dont know what to do.",
    "I just want a hug. Im 16, male, and I have no idea where Im going. Everyone around me wants to do something with their lives, they have their shit figured out, and they know where they want to go and what they want to do. I have no clue. Ive taken test after test trying to figure out where Im supposed to be, but nothing fits. All I want to do is sit down and rest. I spend 99 of my time doing stuff. Im on a competitive rowing team, Im a straight A student, and Im finishing up my Eagle Scout rank. All of this work, and I feel like nothing is coming out of it. I feel empty. I have no idea what I want to do with my life. I feel lost. And thats only half of my issue. I just want to be hugged, I want someone to cuddle and talk with, but nobodys there. I want to feel like I matter to someone other than my family, I want to share my life with someone. But I cant do that. Not at this age. Im just so mad about it, I feel like crying and giving up on all of it, but I know that would only make it worse. Im just tired of the waiting. I wish time would move faster. I wish I could figure it all out. I wish I had someone to love. And I know it only gets worse. I cant see myself living past 20. I cant even visualize it. Ill be lucky if I get that far. Thanks for listening, and have a nice day.",
    "I'm 18F and I don't know if I'm depressed Im 18f and I just feel so sad all the time. I dont know if its depression and I just feel so lost. I dont have any other way to explain it. Im too scared to tell anyone but Ive taken some tests online and they say I have moderate depression but idk if Im choosing the answers correctly  like correctly meaning the way they apply to me. I just feel like not getting up ever again, and thinking that I wanna be alive but I dont want to do anything. I just need clarification. You guys can ask me questions in order to help me, that would actually be much appreciated. I just need the help guys, I need to know why I feel this way. So please please help me.",
    "An entire bottle of Clonazolam I took it last night. On purpose. Because I cant take anymore. All it did was make me tired. I was slapping myself in the face this morning yelling get up you dumb bitch! My family isnt here for me. Ive been through hell throughout my whole life, especially this past year has been horrific. I dont know how much more I can keep forcing myself to act normal. I cant even take my sick days at work because they were all used up when I was in the hospital this year and almost died. I am at my wits end.",
    "I literally can't do anything right now For the past few weeks Ive been feeling more and more depressed. Ive had it controlled well for years but things happening all at once has just brought me to tears at this point. I have a bf, hes amazing but one thing that I would say is wrong with him is he doesnt know how to support me when Im like this. Hell ask whats wrong, If theres something specific Ill tell him, but its been so many things its just everything. And he doesnt know how to respond to that. It just makes me feel incredibly lonely. I havent been able to get out of bed yet 1.30pm here and he just happily stayed on his computer and now hes gone out. I just want to feel better, go about my day but I cant. Theres nothing I want to do. Nobody I know I want to talk to. Im just laying here. How do I get out of this?",
    "I Need Help sorry for my bad English  This year my life turned upside down when my parents broke up. In my family everyone dislikes me without telling me . I am like their own personal helper. Also everyone in the house is against me , for example when me and my brother fight everyone will help my brother , when i and my mom fight everyone supports my mom because she is always superior from me and the best thing is that sometimes when my older brother fights with my mom they bring me into the topic and start saying things like  he always studies and he will never achieve his dreams  or something like that. And the best part is that i cannot get help , i dont want to speak to my mother and solve the problem , i keep everything inside me. One time i was brought to a hospital to speak to a psychiatrist  the guy that helps you when you have a phonological problem  and i started crying because i learned that when thing get tough start crying. I dont know what to do and i am so shy and antisocial that i cannot even ask a teacher for help. Reddit you are my only hope.",
    "I can’t help myself, and there is nowhere to get help. I also noticed that I have an obsession with pain. I noticed that there is not a day that goes by without me thinking about all the horrible things that are happening in the world, all the terrible things that may and will happen to me, how Im hurting my parents by lying to them, how I should be ashamed of myself, and after I go on about this for some time I start to think about how I am selfish for indulging in my own thoughts and problems so much. I also have IBS. It used to be not very bad but these days I sometimes come very close to having a nervous breakdown because of how much pain it causes. I sometimes take almost freezing showers to stop the pain, because my body goes into were dying mode and blocks the pain from my bowels. I feel ashamed of myself. Im living a better life than 90 percent of the world. I dont have to worry about food, getting ill, getting killed or not having a shelter. I live in a clean home. I can take a shower whenever I want. Both my parents are still alive and well. But I dont feel okay. And whining about not feeling okay makes me feel very privileged. But Im not okay. I used to be very into electronics. I used to spend a lot of time into mathematics so that I can understand how electronic circuits work. I actually built my first shortwave radio when I was 12. I was dreaming of becoming an electronics engineer. I always had issues with my gender identity, but it used to be not so bad. Its strange really. Back in the old days, people had a lot of life threatening problems. There were plagues, long and bloody wars, famine etc. I feel very privileged for feeling bad about my issues. And Im not the only one with these problems, and majority of the people in the world has much bigger problems, I know that. But they still try to keep going, but I cant keep going. I cant help myself, I just cant. There is no one that can help me either, and I feel cornered. I dont know what to do.",
    "I am suffering Wanna start by saying its okay im okay one time the police showed up when i posted in a suicide forum. I AM FINE My life is leading a very interesting and difficult path I doubt I will ever get married or meet anyone I miss my old life and freshmen college days of having friends and being a pretty girl. I dont understand my exisistence I thought I was trans for a time and went on testosterone and it deepened my voice and I am not the pretty bubbly, bouncy girl that was once popular and well liked. Men dont like me I have an entirely diffferent group of friends and sometimes yearn for the old one and my thoughts run away with me at night. I never had dysphoria I just hated my period and thats why I went on hormones. I am on birth control now to keep it stopped but I just struggle with life, humans, and wondering why I exist. Idk what to do after college I am petrified of life and I will most likely never be loved I just struggle with being 21 and progressing high school sucked I was in a homeschoolprivate school Duggar type of environment and every day was torture. But it was easier. I had not been on hormones yet. I was innocent. I was a pretty girl. I was well liked. Boys liked me. Its gone now. All gone.",
    "How do I talk to my mom about my anxiety? These past weeks I can feel myself getting more and more anxious about EVERYTHING. Ive had anxiety most of my life and its been manageable due to grounding exercises, keeping my head clear, etc but these past few weeks its been completely unmanageable. No matter what I do these exercises and tools havent been working, even if theyve worked in the past. My anxiety is now to the point that its interrupting my daily life constantly. Ive never talked about to a doctor about my anxiety Im self diagnosed... I know self diagnosing is bad but Im gonna explain why my mom thinks the only time I need to go to the doctor is if Im dying. Shes a psych nurse before that she was a Rn. I just wanna sit down with her and talk about whats going on but shell say stuff like theres plenty of tools you could be using but you refuse to. Even though most of them are tools that dont work for me. She has anxiety and depression too, and once again she has her own tools but thats what works for her not me. Me trying to talk to her usually ends up with her yelling at me about this or that. Its tiring and I think I need professional help. If anyone had any ideas please let me know.",
    "When is it enough? F26 I am a person having my own struggles with depression and anxiety and lately panic attacks. After having read so many stuff online about all these things trying to understand them and unscrew myself, i still feel like im standing at a dead end. Im in the peak years of my life, i should be working on myself. I should be living the life, making friends, having good days and nights. Thats the reason i moved to another country in the end, to make a better life for myself, not drown in self pitty and sorrow. But the lack of motivation and fear of repeating mistakes from the past is paralyzing and thinking leaves me with barely enough energy to get out of bed and drag myself to work. How does this happen, it was never this severe. Thinking about seeking professional help makes me even more anxious because of the language barriere. I cant concentrate at work or even try to be friendly with my coworkers and i know how it looks, i made almost zero friends in a year since im here and i dont like myself as a person or my actions. I am acting completely irrational and i feel like theres no one to talk to. How do you break this toxic circle?",

Im not going to type much here but itd be great if I wasnt a sad fucking mess that does nothing in their life. a few months ago Ive been diagnosed with depression and Im just never in the mood to do anything. Im always tired and I always think about ending it all. To be honest I have a pretty shitty life and at this point I think my parents dont believe in mental health. At least I have one friend that is really helping with all of this mumbo jumbo. She always makes my day at least ten times better. I am really needing help because I dont want anything worse than this happening. Every day I feel horrible to wake up, and the whole day Im just stressing on some random things. I dont want to be miserable every day  this is not how I want to live. Someone please help me.",
    "Depression Help, But From the Other Side. My SO is bipolar and their depression can be triggered by almost anything. They put on a good face with most people but take a lot out on me. I worry about them and do what I can to make it things as stress free as possible for them. I cook, clean, do laundry. Taking them things to work when they want. Offer support. Try to understand them, but that gets difficult sometimes. The relationship isnt good, they dont appreciate what I try to contribute especially when depressed, and it leaves me feeling not only on my own, worst off because Im caring almost full time to them. This is kind of a rant, but I need help helping them while striking a balance for myself because Im quite burnt out getting no reciprocity in the relationship.",
    "I dont think that therapy is doing anything So, Im feeling really bad, but every time I talk to therapist I cant explain whats going on. I just start to cry and only thing that I can answer is I dont know. When she asks me about what I feel and how I feel, why I feel so or why do I think one way or another I cant explain. I just fell worthless, helpless, dumb, ugly, all the worst things, but I cant explain why. I feel like my life is pointless and I dont know what could give me a point. Now I start to think that Im just losing my money on therapy, because all I do is crying infront of woman that asks me questions I cant answer. Should I keep going? What should I do? And when I find answer why I feel so, I dont think it will help. How understanding what I feel, will help me with feeling?",

But I just have no idea what to do with these feelings or thoughts and quite frankly I dont want to be alive all that much. Im young, 17 and my life so far hasnt been as hard as some peoples but its not been the best and this last 2 years especially have been shit. Constant battle with what Im thinking could be adhd, ocd, anxiety and depression although Im not diagnosed so im taking most of these titles with a grain of salt until I do It makes me wonder if all of my adult hood is going to be shit too, I cant quite imagine myself as the happy version of me I used to be, especially going forward. I see nothing beginning to help me. Ive tried substances and techniques and they dont help. Other than weekly therapy and being doped up on some meds I dont see any other options. Has anyone else felt lost, empty, and frustrated in this way and gotten better? Any success stories about conquering mental health? Thanks yall",

This is a first for me. Ive always taken my familys distain for me in stride but Im tired and I cant do it anymore. Im tired of feeling rejected and unloved my family and so called friends. Several of my siblings have betrayed me and that hurts so much more. My bf is trans and they couldnt have reacted worse or said nastier things about us, upon finding out we were dating. I cant make a friend that isnt in love with me and then leaves when they realize I really just wanted a friend. Its happened so often I just dont want to make friends anymore. I dont get it bc Im so transparent about it. I feel so used and alone. My bf is great at making friends and I want to be happy for him but it hurts to see him make friends with real loyal people right off the bat. I want someone to hug me and tell me its going to be okay but there isnt anyone out there looking for a psuedo daughter. It hurts bc I know Im worth so much but what does that matter if people are going to treat me like shit? I keep thinking of how much my parents will regret treating me once Ive died.

I havent seen anyone since December and I think I need to. Im going downhill again. How do I bring it up that Im not doing CBT, mindfulness and homework sheets. My GP offered to write a letter to my old psychologist explaining all that, but my anxiety is too high to go back and be questioned about it. I hate all of this. So much.",
    "Overthinking is killing me I have always been shy, and was recently diagnosed with severe social anxiety. I have also been depressed for about 3 years now, after I had been bullied by some  friends  in middle school, 7th grade. 8th grade was even worse, I had lost all my friends, and had turned into a loner. My freshman year was the same, and the teachers even started to pick on me. Thats when I left, and decided to stay at home and do online school. Both of my parents are hard working, so they couldnt stay home with me, so I had absolutely no motivation at all to work on school, and barely passed. I am now a Sophomore and only have online friends. I overthink EVERYTHING to the point where I cant even text my friends online anymore, because I worry I will say something weird. It has never gotten this bad, I used to be funny, and I didnt overthink as much. I was almost outgoing. I dont know what to do. Ive tried talking to a few therapists before, but it has never helped and i am not sure about any medications. It is really hard for me to post this, but I need some help.",
    "Things just keep getting worse On the background check it says I was sentenced to jail  I wasnt, but might even been for failure to pay the fines. There may be warrants out for my arrest for failure to pay the fines, I dont know. They still havent told me what additional information they need, but I dont really think it could be anything but that. I feel like my mistakes and being poor the past few years are going to prevent me from ever getting a job and making things better. Ive made mistakes, Ive paid for them, Ive learned from them. But I just havent been able to pay the fines. Even if they decide to give me the job, I have doubts theyll have me start next Monday since people will be off for Thanksgiving. So I wouldnt even start working til Dec. and wouldnt get a paycheck until Dec. 15. And this job is remote and I cant work from home once the power is cut off. I dont have anybody I can ask for any type of help. And Im really feeling pretty hopeless right now. Its literally taken me years to get this 1 job offer and its looking like it isnt going to happen. I just dont see how things can get better when it looks like things are definitely going to get worse. I could use the public WiFi somewhere like the library, but I dont know how I could do that while being on Zoom calls for most of the day. Even with a headset Id still be bothering others when Im talking. If youve got a better idea of what I could do for a few weeks, please let me know. I would LOVE to have a good job, get caught up on rent and utility bills, pay my fines and get on with having a life. Im just so frustrated and discouraged and depressed right now.",

    "I wasn't diagnosed with depression So I spoke to a psychiatrist today. Ive been suspecting that Im depressed for years now. I have a hard time with really basic taskspersonal hygiene. I have no energy. I have really demeaning thoughts about myself, and my self esteem is extremely low. I think about dying pretty much all the time, and my suicidal ideation has greatly increased recently. I have no motivation and I cant see any kind of future for myself, let alone a happy one. Just generally, Im not happy at all. Now, the psychiatrist told me I have generalized anxiety disorder, and I was diagnosed with anxiety years ago, so that makes sense to me. But when I told him everything that I mentioned above and then some, he told me that these symptoms were not the primary focus, and that treating anxiety should make them go away. He never explicitly said that I have depression, which is throwing me off. Obviously Im not a professional, but the way he didnt actually name the reason for my symptoms is making me feel like such an idiot. I feel like all this time, Ive been making it up that Im not actually depressed and all my symptoms are just in my head. I just dont know what to do. I feel horrible about myself.",

I keep seeing ads or public service announcements with celebrities that say Do you want to talk about it? Find someone to talk to. Im here for you to talk to. My problem is that I dont want to talk about it. I am ashamed. I feel weak and incapable of solving my own problems. I feel like my life is objectively great with no real reason to feel this way. I dont want to whine, I dont want to dwell. But I do recognize that talking about it has to happen if anything is going to get better. The people close to me clearly see theres a problem and inquire. My default response is I dont want to talk about it. Or I ignore the question. Or I change the subject. How do I get over this hurdle of being able to talk about this with anyone?",
    "Looking for advice to get through severe episode while waiting on meds trial to kick in Im currently waiting for my latest meds to hopefully kick in, but am suffering a lot in the meantime. Id love any suggestions for getting through the days. I have tried exercising, hobbies quilting, knitting, gardening, TV, getting out of the house, reading, pot, booze, etc. Nothing seems to help to rein in the increasinglyaggressive negative thoughts. Sometimes I just cry or stare out the window. Even petting or playing with my cats feels like stress. I try to nap it away, but I cant fall asleep during the day.

    "Depressed person trying to support a depressed person I thought it would be easier to think of ways to help someone I know who is showing signs of depression because I too am depressed, but its actually so hard. I know just being there is such a big part but Im NOT there and cant be, we live across the country from each other. How do I let someone know Id be happy to talk to them as long as physically possible if they wanted to without it coming across as babying or OTT, because I truly would stay up for days talking to this person if they wanted, or even if they didnt, I love them so much, I love talking to them and I think theyre such a cool person, and want to convey that without it coming across as mollycoddling. They called me last night in the middle of the night whilst drunk, which they never do, and when I got in touch this morning they text saying they pressed the wrong button not possible unless theyve made no calls in the last two weeks, they would have had to search for my number and call me and joked about being at a friends student halls this week and feeling so alienated, Im worried about them. I told them to give me a call when theyre back home to tell me all about it but now Im worried theyll take that as me not wanting to talk now, which they might want to. Ahhhhh its difficult, trying to strike the balance between showing you care and not treating someone like a child is like, impossible.

    "I've given up trying to change because all I do feel less and less bad for myself when I fail Im an 18 year old male. Ive been able to do nothing but reject any help I get or fail trying to get myself back on track. Nothing really motivates me, other than distractions so Im not reminded that I wont be able to keep myself alive in the real world. Any support I receive now is all I rely on, and I have no reason to be lazy and unwilling to do anything about myself. Yet whenever I try, I always wind back to the start. I surround myself with positive people, but all I manage to do is shower them with support instead of myself. Ill admit, its because I know theyll use that support to succeed, unlike me. I used to be afraid that Id always be like this, but now its just a reality Ive accepted, and its made me bitter and unintentionally hostile towards those who know more about me than the carefree mask I put on. I like to think that when I get I job money will motivate me. It wont. Ill just be stuck in my own world and just accept the fact that Ive been fired after a week. Ive tried before. Its done nothing. Its a problem that affects all aspects of me. All of them. And it makes me feel like less of a person when I see others get back up from worse. When other people lash out at me for being defiant and wasting their support, or not being of any use or having any real reason to be kept around, I just sit there and take it with a blank face. They tell me things I already know, then try to lighten it by them just being angry in the moment, or just trying to get me to wake up. I know what they say is true, and I can tell that they hope to God that I come to my senses and start improving myself. Ive been this way as long as I can remember and nothing good has happened. Ive only become more numb to the situation and more accepting of my failure. I used to care. Alot.",

    "I’m drowning and I don’t know what to do Sometimes I think that maybe I dont really know what I want. I hate it. I hate how I look at other people and hate them. I hate when they smile, I hate when they laugh I hate how fucking happy everyone else is. Im being left behind. I know I am, everyone is so far ahead of me and Im drowning in my own damn mind. I cant keep this up. I cant keep smiling and pretending Im cool with being the lonely asshole who stays in her room all day. Who only goes outside to go to class or to get some unhealthy shit that shell feel bad about ten minutes later. I dont think I want to die. I just... I want to be free. But maybe freedom is death for me. I want to hit something. I want to yell and scream but at the same time I just want someone to hug me and tell me that its okay and that I matter. But that wont happen. Not in a way thats genuine and real, its all fucking pretend to make people feel better and act like they actually care for the small lonely bitch who tries too hard to not care at all. If Im alone then maybe its better for me to leave anyway, fully embrace it instead of begging for some kind of helping hand. No one would really care if I go. I give them three months tops until I just become a distant name they remember every so often. Everything is so loud but painfully silent at the same time why cant it stop I want everything to just fucking stop. I tried to get help last year but they just pretended to care about me to. They read straight off a damn script. Didnt take long for me to figure out the pattern and say what I needed to get out. I dont know what to do anymore. I feel like this my final chance to ask for help before I go back into a hole I may not be able to escape from again. I dont trust anyone and those few that I do hole a level of trust for I dont want to burden them so I smile and play it off as some edgy joke.",
    "Just out of Week long stay in hospital for depression and appreciate any helpful advice on proactive steps to avoid again hospitalization I would very much appreciate any tips or advice on how I can proactively deal with my depression before it again rises to the level of requiring hospitalization? I am on newer meds but what are some effective ways to deal with the symptoms aside from just waiting for medication to work? Are there help lines or online groups or other avenues I can pursue? Thank you",
    "At my wits end.... literally. I’ve lost all hope, I’m lost in my own head. So numb, tired, and ready to leave already. Its been roughly a year, I recently moved out of my parents house around this time last year. And its all gone to shit... I guess I rushed into adulthood faster then I should. Was promised a job from my mother in law. That only lasted 3 weeks. Ive been bouncing from warehouse to warehouse job for the last year. I feel disconnected from my own life. Worthless... like I dont belong. My relationship with my SO is rough. Theres days where its the ideal relationship, and days where I feel like Im the only one loving and actually trying. My relationship with my own family is little to none. I dont have the courage to say whats really going on. Idk I would rather people not care about me. Not worry or pressure me about whats going on. But Im at the end of my road and my last options are dark. I cant keep a job, cant keep a place, cant hold a conversation with family and friends. Im so numb and hollow. I cry randomly throughout the day, suicidal scenarios play out in my head all throughout the day. What if I wasnt around? People wouldnt have to worry. I wouldnt have to live a life I feel like I dont deserve. Ive contemplated actually doing it numerous times. Just cant choose on how and where as in stuck babysitting majority of the days. I feel like Im rambling all over the place but its how I am at this point. I have no structure in life. My schedule consists of doing everything for everyone else and then sleep. I feel useless and more importantly worthless.",

    "How not to think life is unfair to you? I have depression for years and I am the highly functioning kind. I do a lot, I study, I work, I try to take courses who will make me better at my job and everything demands a crazy amount of effort from me because of... you guessed! Depression! Then I see people around me that do not do shit and things seem to fall on their lap. They get bonus at work, the shares they bought made a crazy amount of money, family comes visit with amazing gifts for them, they get promotions at work while telling me they are putting the minimum effort on what they do... life in general seems to be so easy for them. I know I shouldnt compare. I know I should focus on the percentage I am better today when compared to me yesterday. But it is freaking hard. I feel like a huge failure in everything I touch or try to do. From money, work, health, family and friends relationships, I do not succeed in any of these areas. How to stop with thinking it is unfair? How not to care about the others?",
    "Comfort makes it worse Hello, this is my first time posting here. I dont usually talk at all to anyone about my depression but its been getting. Just so much worse. My main question right now is why does seeking comfort make me feel worse? I absolutely cannot be comforted physically, not even by my long term partner, and if I seek out comfort items like my own stuffed animals or blankets or even my living very loving cat for cuddles I feel worse. And guilty for being sad enough to want comfort. I want to feel better but all the things that should make me feel better do the opposite Im sorry for rambling Thank you",

    "My friend says she's depressed but doesn't \"seem\" so and it triggers me Hello, Ive struggled with depression diagnosed until last year, so Im pretty familiar with the topic and mental health in general, which is why I suggested my friend, who was having some problems at school and some angry issues, to talk about it with our school counselor. She went there twice and shes now convinced that she has depression, I didnt say anything because I dont want to invalidate her feeling but honestly I dont think so but again, im not the one who should say it. First of all, she told me the counselor didnt mention it, but made her understand it in a subtle way. Also, she doesnt exhibit any signs of depression, she doesnt have a lack of interest in doing things, or a change in appetite. I feel very bad writing this, I know every depression is different, but she has no problems going through the day, and its always the one to ask to hang out for example, while I couldnt and sometimes still cant get out of bed in the morning, let alone function properly. All of this makes me feel extremely uncomfortable, every time she talks about it with idk what to say because I cant really empathize with her. She also mentions it a lot, which makes me even more uncomfortable, like the other time she was like oh, we are both depressed, what a great couple! and I was like wtf, first of all Im not depressed, and then I know it may be a way to cope with it but it sounded really bad.",

    "I’m starting to have a harder time functioning Hey, Im a 19 yo male 20 on Easter. Thought that would be a fun thing to throw in and Ive been living with depression since I was 9 or 10. Its just progressed as Ive gone on. Ive always been an extremely self loathing person and the negative thoughts just come up more frequently. It just happens out of nowhere. Doesnt matter what Im doing, itll just sucker punch me. My mood gets really dark at the snap of a finger. But now its getting harder to actually cope with it and function as a human being. I think its been this way for about a year now. I used to be able to escape it if I was doing something active. Like with friends or whatever. But now it doesnt matter. Itll just fuck me up whenever. Sometimes it can get to the point where Ill have difficulty remembering things or having a conversation, I dont know how to formulate sentences, and it just becomes allconsuming. I dont understand it. My thoughts in this state range from craving substances to escape, thoughts about how nobody likes me and I dont matter to anyone, and sometimes thoughts that I need to hang myself. I want to have a good life but I dont want to live it as me. Im way too hard on myself. I know I have a charismatic personality that some people enjoy, and I can acknowledge some of my strengths when Im more level headed, but more and more I just regress to what I described earlier where my mind just tries to take me down.",

Ive spoken to her about the impact this is having on me, she acknowledges this nd within days its back to the way it was. Im trying to be as supportive as I can but its so so hard.

    "Depression and anxiety in cross cultural relationships? Year round I contend with anxiety and depression, successfully medicated for around 10 years now. Each winter I battle SAD in the form of depression and anxiety, and all the fun ways in which those can manifest themselves. Work interactions and personal relationships in particular suffer my closest friends either seem not to notice or just cut me a load of slack, for which Im grateful! This past summer I began dating someone who lives in another part of the US and grew up in the Philippines. As December rolled into January I explained how this time of year often affects me and I expect even more so by working strictly from home. I also reminded her that I take prescription meds. Her response is that Americans are weak and we should just get our and walk plus spend time with others, as no one in her home country ever has to take medication. That kind of sounds like bullshit in general, and also felt very insensitive for her to have said. Is it typical for other cultures to regard Americans in such a way regarding mental illness?",
    "Gotten to a really weird place where I don't even want tv on in the background After a decade of depression, Ive finally gotten to a strange place. I cant distract myself with media anymore. I just sit in a room. Ive spent the better part of my life on a computer or my phone, but that isnt helping anymore. Ive lost interest in my shows, sites, creative outlets, its just all gone. I dont look forward to anything even a little and thats beyond anything Ive dealt with before. I always had media to keep me occupied. I dont even want junk food, and thats a very out of character thing I just dont know what to do with my time. Everything is too much. I shower once a week at most, I interact with people once a fortnight, I havent cooked in months, I feel like Im moving house every time I need to go outside because its such a big undertaking, I dont have a job and looking for work is an impossible task Therapists have told me they dont know what to do with me. I cant afford one now anyway. I was on medication for years and it didnt help. Ive been off meds for a year now and feel mentally much better without them. Im just really not sure what to do with myself",
    "My mom is depressed and I don't know how to help her Hi everyone, this is my first time posting here so let me know if this this isnt the right place. ampx200B My 20F mom 58F has been depressed, to some degree, for as long as I can remember. Were a pretty sad family all together honestly, but thats all Ive known from them. ampx200B For some backstory My dad 61M fixed up my grandparents old house the one my mom grew up in over the course of a few years. The old house was falling apart, and my dad wanted a new place to renovate before he got too old to do so. My mom never wanted to move in, but reluctantly agreed once my dad pointed out the benefits. ampx200B So here we are, a year after we move in, after all the garage sales and selling the old house, getting rid of sentimental items we couldnt keep and all the junk we didnt want. And shes spiraling, guys. Ive always been her person to vent to, since Ive been alive. And every night she tells me just how tired she is, of everything. How she misses the old house that they spent over 30 years in, how she hates every tiny thing my dad does, just blaming him for everything. She cried into my arms tonight asking what she has to look forward to everyday, to just tell her something good in her life to look forward to. And no matter what I said she would just cry harder. ampx200B I dont know what to do to help her, if anything. I know my dad isnt going to help because they argue just about every day and havent got along in like.. 15 years. My mom doesnt have many friends either, just her sister and some people she cleans houses for. Is there anything I can do to help her on the bad days?",
    "How to talk to doc? Hi all. 24 M here and around thanksgiving I finally did something about my depression and mentioned it to my primary care doc. Long story short I take 100 mg sertraline daily now and things have gotten noticeably better over those months, but i now am seeing a trend that frightens me a little. I know mood swings can be a side effect of a lot of antidepressants, but Im finding myself more prone to flying off the handle into fits of anger super quickly. Not too much more often, but Im way easier to set off, and I quickly become unhinged, to the point Im afraid honestly. Yesterday I had a moment I had to sit because I got so worked up i was afraid Id hurt my dog he was running away outside , which I never ever want to do. I went and cried had a long think after that. Idk how to bring up to my doctor my concerns about these outbursts, and whether or not to chalk it up as side effects or if its another part of whatever the hell is going on.",
    "It's not getting better.. Please listen and dont downvote me. Ive been facing severe depression and anxiety for about 8 years now. Needless to say, its been dreadful. I finally sought professional help in the form of psychiatrist. Turns out his meds made things worse. Then after some years, I thankfully found a good psych who did make a difference. The difference is this I became more functioning. Thats it. The inner turmoil is still very much there. Ive been to multiple therapists Mind you, were talking about the most well renowned and expensive therapists in my region but it just made no positive change at all. We went at lengths to discuss and dissect me and my life and my behaviors and my emotions. All this analysis increased my overthinking to the point that now my mind constantly thinks and is aware of each and everything. Like hey you did this because of xyz feeling. Its painfully exhausting. Its like a constant 247 commentary in my mind, which was fueled by the therapy. After each therapy session, I felt ashamed, guilty, and worthless. So much negativity about me. Reinforcing the idea that there is something gravely wrong with me. Never did I feel validated at therapy. Never was I told what I can do to feel better. It was like talking to a mirror. Just reflecting back what I said. Which quite frankly, I dont need to hear as my mind has been chattering all those things for years now. I am very lost, confused, hurt and hopeless now. I cannot find any solution. What can I do..",

    "Dealing with toxic parents and mental illnesses I have a friend whom Im doing my best to support. She has grave issues with her family. Her father is extremely toxic, he calls her names, does not allow certain things, picks on her physically. Her little sister has learned this behavior from her father and does the same thing, but more often. Actually, she hates to stay home and spends her days outside or someplace like a cafe, college, rpg clubs. She has ridiculously low selfesteem and cant see anything good in her life. Looks like she gets really happy and emotional if I take a walk with her, invite her for lunch or just chat with her, but reality hits her harder and I cant be there for her every time. Moreover, she has mental illnesses like anxiety and panic attacks that are provoked by extreme emotions happiness, fear, sadness and need medication to fight it. It appears that she had a few attempts to take her life... Is there a good way for a depressed person to deal with a toxic family? No, moving out is not an option since finances are scarce.

    "How can I (28f) help my Mum (56f) who is depressed and considering suicide. Previously they had a friendly but distant relationship without regular contact. Calling me and my sister at all hours of the day and night in tears mostly when she is drunk to just talk and keeping us on the phone for literally hours her last call to me was 4hrs and 42 minutes at 10pm until she feels better or passes out. This occurs approximately twice a week to both of us. Previously we would text regularly and call about every 710 days. Refusing to deal with anything concerning her Mothers my grandma, 88f increasingly poor health. She started doing this as she suspects that people think she is trying to kill Grandma which is completely unfounded. She had previously been the main point of contact for the local council and doctors for anything related to Grandmas care and has had medical power of attorney for abut a decade  a sibling has since taken over responsibility for facilitating Grandmas care as a direct result of her behaviour. She has begun drinking increasingly heavily over the the last 2years. Currently she consuming 12 bottles of wine most nights, has very recently starting consuming spirts in addition to this. She is routinely drinking to the point where she is passing out in her own vomit. Previously she was only a light social drinker. Frequently making statements such as just wanting to die, I should just die, someone should just shoot me, ill just die. This is happening multiple times in the same conversation, it must be adding up to hundreds of instances per day. There have been many other behaviour changes I have noticed but the ones listed are the ones that are new to her and are alarming me the most. For further context, she lives alone in a country town, does not have a significant other or any pets and my sister and I both live hours away from her and have done so for years as do all her siblings. She has had some major stressors in her life recently. Obviously Coronavirus has been a big thing, she is an essential worker and has been working the whole time. Her employer has recently sold their business and she is very concerned about her job stability when the new owners take over. Grandmas health has been worsening and Grandma is resisting the idea of going into a care home.",

What would be the single most important thing the public gets wrong about Depression. What do people who never had any experience with it dont get? 2.

She wanted to stay a virgin till marriage and we same the same religious values, which I loved and respected so much which I think is part of the reason its so hard on me.

    "How do i cope with un-ending sadness So my partner has been dealing with sadness and suicidle thoughts all their entire life its so extremely hard to help them i do help every time we are together its perfect absolutely perfect for both of us i am everything to them and i help as much as i possibly can but theres only so much i can do as we arent together every single minute. they have been hurt by their previous partner and emotional damage from their moms emotional and physical abuse in the past ranging from brith i think until her 5th grade year thats when the physical abuse slapping cornering shoving head under bathtub water pushing into walls but the emotional abuse has continued until this year about a few months ago their mom has been very extremely nice to her randomly for no reason. My partners depression gets extremely bad she is constantly sad and frequently has suicidle thoughts and gets very overwhelmed with her home life has asthma attacks and panic attacks for apparently no reason. I am running out of ideas i have done everything for her and i am continuing to do so but my mental illnesses sometimes makes it almost impossible to help and vise versa. She had said many times she wants to get better so bad and get out of her house when shes 18 so we can get engaged but she says she cant see a way out i have alot of experience with helping people out of suicide but the longer this goes on the worse i feel about how good of a job i do with her i used to feel very good about our phone conversations because my advice was always perfect she would go from a full blown panic attack anxiety attack to laughing with me making jokes and talking about all the things we were going to do in the future and how to achieve our goals now it seems like they end in her not actually feeling better just acting better or pushing the thoughts away. Please help me find ways to help them cope for the 3 more years they have in their house and how to help her get from the ground up as i have to do this 57 days now.",
    "Don’t have the energy Havent had water for the past 5 days here at the house and I really dont think I could care less. I barely can keep up with basic human shit. I dont drink water, I get by with a couple cups of pop a day. Its my one vice. I dont eat hardly anything yet Im still fat and not in the nice places, like I practically have the ugliest female body you can imagine. No the fat didnt go to my boobs. My boobs look like man boobs, saggy, yet very small. No Im not exaggerating. Huge stomach, I am genuinely surprised I havent been mistaken for being pregnant yet. Its more than my looks I guess just going on a tangent but I hate it. I cant get a job, Ive practically given up on that too. Im literally a fucking leech on this planet, parasite of a human. Im not suicidal so thats good, too much of a wimp I think. But I cant imagine my complete lack of self care is great. I mean I havent showered in probably two weeks or more. Yeah Im fucking gross and disgusting have at it. Oh and yeah I live with my mom and my mom basically helps keep me alive. If it werent for her I honestly dont know. So yeah Im not suicidal but I do think Id be better of dead sometimes. Huge burden off my mom, burden off my dad for him not having to worry about me because Im depressed and isolated. Less burden off my brother for worrying about my safety. I dont know where Ill be in 10 years. Im so isolated, I dont see anyone other than my mom, and I barely see her. Im all alone in my room all the time. I dont know what to do.",
    "I am very lonely and my house mate bangs his girlfriend every day behind my wall. I am 39, trying to cope with my depression. It was triggered by being alone for 2 years, after 9 year long relationship. I am frustrated as fuck and my hose mate fucks his sexy girlfriend every day in the next room. I am dying inside. I am well built, smart, have passions and interesting job but still cant make any connections with women. But I would be able to live with that, maybe even fix it, but now I am locked with two horny people in one house and I want to blow my brains out. metaphorically speaking so far. Headphones help a bit, but its not only about noises as you guys might guess. I cant stand their happiness, it just reminds me of what I am missing out on. I cant be happy for them, and it only makes me think worse about myself. They are looking for a new place but it might take months. Same for me if I want to move out. I am scared of loneliness. I need some sex but it dose not work for me with prostitutes. I tried Tinder and other stuff, no real results and I am loosing hope with every day passing. I mean I am now talking to a bunch of strangers on the internet to flush some of my frustration away and get advice. I started therapy but it is too early to say if it helps. I dont want to be swallowed by this demon but it is chewing on me for some time now. Maybe you guys can help me out... Ill try anything to get better.",

    "How can I deal with Bipolar people? Im kind of sick of walking on eggshells around my dad... Hes sick and needs to be under watch, and my mom doesnt have that time while I do, so I chose to stay with him and help around. But its incredibly hard to deal with his mercurial temper  it can change at the drop of a hat! Sometimes all it takes to trigger his rage is a little comment. Im tired, my heart is tired. I cant give up on him because I know its a disease and not really his fault, but Im made of flesh and blood too! Does anyone has a way to deal with these kind of situation? Just sitting and enduring verbal abuse is so, so draining... my usual coping method is to wait until his temper cools down and for him to apologize  but everytime this happens I break a little. Advice please.",

    "I need help Hey guys, so this may seem like a weird thing to need help with but Im just trying to figure out if Im actually depressed or if Im going through something else. Im nineteen and recently I just moved to another state for school and lately I havent been attending most of my classes and my grades are extremely bad right now. I just cant seem to get myself to go. Im just surprised because I have never done this before, its not like me to skip classes. Most mornings I just lay in bed until noon. I dont know if this is extreme laziness or something else. Im constantly in my head and Im extremely worried about my grades but am I really that worried if I keep skipping class? I also feel like I have a lot of anxiety when I have to be around a lot of people, especially ones I dont know. I know Im an introverted person but being an introvert doesnt mean that I have anxiety around a lot of people, I just prefer to be in a small group or by myself most of the time. I even get anxious when Im just walking to class or going to the grocery store my myself. I dont really feel happy most of the time, and I dont think Ive felt happy for a while. I can get temporary happiness by watching something funny or by reading a book since thats my favorite thing to do, but right after Im done Im right back to where I was. I dont understand what it is, I have loving parents and they have given me all I could hope for they are helping me financially by helping pay for my rent and by paying for the classes I am taking right now and yet I dont have the decency to even repay that by going to class. Im just not sure whats going on with me and if Im just being extremely lazy or if I am depressed.",
    "Lately I have been feeling really depressed and cant control my emotions. Please read below and tell me what could be wrong? I generally feel like no one cares for me or even wants to genuinely listen. I have been getting really depressed and then the next minute, I feel ok. Its like a rollercoaster. To a point where I have been overdosing on pills and even cutting myself and when I cut myself, I smile cause I think I deserve it. I feel embarrassed to even feel any emotions, cause I feel like Im nothing at all. I really want to kill myself, but whats stopping me is that what if I survive again. I tried to take my life by taking pills, but I survived. And no one even noticed or knew. No one stays in my life and even if they do, they find me weird or they just want to use me. I hate, I genuinely hate myself.",
    "I feel so empty Its been nearly four months since my dog passed. And Ive had maybe a handful of good days. I cant even make a ham sandwich without getting upset sometimes. Ive been up since midnight and I cant get back to sleep. My sleep patterns are all over the place. Setting a set time for sleep just adds to my stress. And the. My anxiety goes all haywire. I did start one of my hobbies back up, but I noticed I can easily get lost in it and blow time I need to do chores or run errands. And while its good distraction , it hasnt gotten its joy back yet. Just finding a new routine without my caregiving duties, and especially without mymy Moms dog has just been hell. Nothing feels as good and any step I take is without them. I literally got a slight raise at work, and the first person I wanted to tell, I couldnt because shes gone. Its like I cant even be happy with anything because I dont have anyone to share it with who cares. Even when my dog was here, I still felt pride that I was doing good for her and making her life a little better. I dont know. Life just isnt as fun without them. And while I dont feel suicidal, every thing just feels like motions and so dull. Sorry to post yet again, the sad anxiety just really gets to me.",

    "Wife has been struggling with postpartum for 18 months Our son is 18 months old and my wife has been struggling with PPD since the first week. In some ways she has gotten better. The first month she would have breakdowns and cry and would have to leave the house. Since then she just seems apathetic to most things. A typical day she wont want to get out of bed. I work remote so I will grab our son and change his diaper and feed him breakfast. She will get up after I ask her a few times. Being alone with our son stresses her out. Most days her mom will come over and watch our son or she will take him to her house. She usually just lays on the couch or in bed on her phone most of the day. When I get off work we will go pick up our son. Once we are home she will usually sit on the couch and she will interact with him a bit, but I do most of the child care. Once our son goes to bed, she usually will lay down in bed. She will usually have only been awakeout of bed for 8 hours total. She has told me she doesnt want to be a mom. It breaks my heart to hear her say that. I want my son to have a mother who loves him. I know she does but the depression covers everything up. She has been on different medications and is going to therapy but nothing seems to ever help. I dont know what to do anymore. I want to help but I dont know how. Some people in family have said we should do tough love and make her take care of our son more, or go out and do things. I dont think it is that easy though. Does anyone have any advice?

    "Advice? Hi, In advance! Im not the best out there on explaining my feelings since thats very far away from my culture, but Ill try because I dont know what else to do. Im 26 and not too long ago I changed my career path to something which Ive always wanted to do. Prior to this, which was about a year and a half ago I felt as though Ive been in an emotional hole I couldnt get out of. My new job distracted me for a long while, I was even being complimented on how I suddenly seemed like myself again up until about 6 months ago, when I just fell back in to my own bullshit of complete and utter numbness. The issue is, that normally lasts a few weeks for me but its been 6 months or longer now and I cant seem to shake it. I dont want to speak to anybody, I love my family and friends but I cant seem tomake the effort I guess? This resulted in me losing important connections and even severing them because I cant for the life of me understand what the point of them is when I cant be a good person to them. Then I have the audacity to feel loneliness and feel even more sorry for myself  When I do talk to the people I have left I cant focus on the conversation and I just drift off in to absolutely nothing, so it never lasts long. My question is to those who have managed to get through this without medication I cant have medication due to the nature of my job How did you manage to do it? Am I missing something? I will do everything I possibly can to help myself but Ive tried so much. I got back in the gym, Im eating well, Ive meditated, Ive gone for walks, Ive listened to music to self medicate, Ive slept decent amounts. I cant seem to enjoy doing anything anymore and my passion for life has been put out like someone suddenly pissed on a bonfire. I feel like I get closer and closer to giving up everyday and Im just too close to it this time to the point Im starting to scare myself every now and again with the thoughts that come in to my mind. Any suggestions would help so much.",
    "Can't move on. I think it's the end for md Hello Reddit. Ive come here today to say what I feel in my core, and if I cant take anymore, then may this be my suicide note and my farewell to humankind. Im 24 years old, male, Brazilian, and I cant take anymore. I think about the only thing I was able to accomplish in my life, failures. As a middle class person on a average poor country, I always had everything handed. Was handsomely educated thanks to my familys money. Always were quick to learn stuff and was English fluent at 15. However I never managed to be able to study, to take time away from what I felt like doing, which is play video games or playing bassguitar, and this caused me to have low grades on school, and bring trouble to my relationship with my parents. After school I went to college but dropped out because it was not what I wanted to work with. Then I got into another college and dropped out again. I always liked listening and playing instruments, and Ive been playing bass since my 16. Decided, then, to become a musician. Turns out I cant study music, just like I couldnt study anything when I was a teenager. I work at a shit job that pays me a laughable salary, I dont have any skills that could help me get another job and I am unable to learn any skills from scratch. Everytime I try to learn something, for example, music, I fail. Nowadays, when Im not working at my shit job, I am drinking, playing video games or doing any other thing that would make me forget who I am and push the hurtful feeling and thought away. I cant take this anymore. I dont know if Ill be alive tomorrow, but I thank every and each one of you who reads this, I have no one else to say what I feel of think. Goodbye.",

    "I want to go home I want to be with my family the way we were when we all lived under the same roof and to work in the garden and take walks through the desert with my brother, looking for elk and coyote tracks in the river basin. I want to hear the native languages I grew up hearing, but not understanding, in school again. I want to go back to the nights when we didnt have enough money to pay our electricity bill and my mom and dad would bring out the oil lamps and our domino set and wed play games and read by the lamplight and just enjoy each others company. I miss my dad coming home from work, bonetired and smelling like the propane he would fill train cars with for transport and the way hed give me a big hug and a snuggle before he went to bed. I miss the tiny town I went to school in and the way I believed in the church I went to wholeheartedly. I miss going to the Fourth of July Rodeo a few towns over. I miss my mom making us oatmeal pancakes and homemade buttermilk syrup on mornings wed go out to the juniper stands and cut wood for the winter. I go to sleep at night hoping that when I wake up, that is where I am. I wake up in the morning devastated that instead, Ive woken up in my apartment to an alarm clock and have to get ready for school and then work. Absolutely devastated. I dont know how to get over it. I am just existing. I cant find joy in anything. I feel like my life has no purpose and that Im just going through the motions. Im terrified of the day that one of my family members dies. Im scared that one day something will happen and we wont see each other again. That Ill come back to the farm and find that everything wed built is gone and that I will never find comfort. I am at a loss of what to do. I dont know what I want from this post, but I just needed to put these words down and get them off my chest. My parents would be distraught if they knew I was so sad.

    "This is me finally talking about “it”. I do not have depression, my husband does. He has depression, but we dont use that word. We say dark days and on those days his mood is selfdescribed as blah. He has depression, but we dont talk about it. Its not for lack of trying on my part. I wish he could open up and tell me how hes feeling. I wish he could cry with me and tell me that well get through this as much as I tell him. My husband has depression, but we dont tell anyone about it. Wheres your husband? Is the hardest question to hear sometimes. Why didnt your husband come? He isnt feeling well, I say. We decided he needed to get some rest. We dont talk about it. It is dark. It is a cloud that hangs over our house for weeks. Sometimes, it isnt so bad. We have good days. We even have great months. Beautiful months. But it rears its ugly head and we know. We know because the house feels tight. The rooms when were together feel as though they are squeezing in. It doesnt care that I need to be touched, or that I need to touch my husband. We dont talk about it. But we do fight through. We stand back to back. Sometimes, I have to support both of us with my broken emotions and iron love, and thats okay. I know he realizes all of this, I know because in those good days and great months, Im treated as a queen. We make love and make memories and we shine. We shine so bright that I know when the dark days come, well fight them. He knows he has me somewhere in those dark, cold days, even if he cant see or hear me, he knows Im there. And I know that hes there, too, still the man I love, the hero of my fairytale. The hardest part though, the part that I wish we could change because depression isnt something that can just be fixed, I know this my husband has depression, but we dont talk about it.",

I seem to get away from everyone, and after some manic episodes some of them find me pretty weird. Im very sad that Im supposed to be having not only a good time, but a great time, instead Im miserable, jealous, and apparently somewhat suicidal. I hate it that Im staying in bad feeling sad and depressed, and feeling sad and depressed about feeling sad and depressed. And Im having the worse time in such magical teenage years. I dont expect anyone to solve this to me, their is nothing to solve, just keep going to therapy and take my pills that seem to get more intense with time instead of less Im just asking for some recognition of the pain, and maybe some people to tell me how it gets better, its kind of stupid, but it helps a little, thinking it might ever end and Im not messing my best years",

Ive lost all but few friends now that Im desperately holding on too, but I just dont know if I can continue to deal with this pain because no matter how man counselors or therapists Ive seen it alway just seems to never get better.

    "I suffer from persistent depression and my GF wants to leave me. I 39M suffer from persistent depression. Even as a kid Ive been depressed, bullied and have felt unloved and flawed due to a difficult upbringing and undiagnosed ADHD. I suffered from this well into my adulthood. Feeling broken and flawed. About three years ago I got diagnosed with ADHD and being in a bad situation with work and a bad breakup after a very long relationship led to depression diagnosis. I got CBT and was put on ADHD meds that helped out a bunch with my ADHD. Now on to my current situation and my reason for this post About 2,5 years ago I met this great girl and we hit it of in a long distance relationship. Shes loving, positive and very helpful. She can be short tempered though and has some insecurities. Unfortunately my work situation went from bad to worse and I just couldnt do it anymore. I got help and this led to some more help from a shrink but I was put on hold for almost two years now and I never felt so lonely, sad and depressed. Also the Covid19 pandemic did not help things either. Right now I am seeing another shrink and a psychiatrist that is helping me out with my ADHD meds. At this moment I am so tired and feel like I can not enjoy things anymore. I feel resentful and frustrated. Obviously I am in a bad place and this unfortunately damaged my relationship and my sweet girlfriend. I noticed her pulling away from me, getting frustrated with me and or irritated. At times Ive gotten the silent treatment. Sometimes I acted out in a way that hurt her in stressful situations or moments where I felt like Ive failled. Like forgetting important things, not doing something or being late again and again. She got mad or gave me the silent treatment. My anxiety got the better of me. Offcourse we talked, and that was difficult at times. I felt sad, misunderstood and she made it clear that she felt talking about it was a bad thing. Last night she told me she did not see a future for us in that way.",

But Im still stuck at my shitty job, and its negatively affecting my mental and physical health. Back in February, she quit her job because her anxiety and agoraphobia got so bad that she couldnt go in to work. She just stopped going and told her boss that it was health related. She was unemployed for a few months while she searched for something else and I was the only wageearner during that period. My car broke down, we lost our storage unit, I struggled to make rent, etc. Shes working again and making more money doing something thats better for her health and Im so happy for her. But Im losing it. Im slipping. Im angry all of the time. Physically, Im in a lot of pain. My wrist hurts every time I move it. My back aches. My knee which I injured last year has never had a chance to heal properly because Im always working. Mentally, Im struggling. I cant keep going on like this. I need to quit my job. But when I say that, my spouse just says, Ill help you apply for jobs. Ill help you write a cover letter. My mother says I shouldnt quit without a job lined up. But my spouse quit her job without having something lined up. Why am I not allowed to quit? And if I mention maybe going back to work with kids again, my spouse freaks out because she doesnt want me working with kids because of the pandemic. I just want out of this job! Why cant I just LEAVE?",
    "Should I kill myself? I am the most uninteresting person and I feel like I am the only one who puts effort into any of my relationships. I slowly got more and more awkward and struggled more and more to reach out. Once highschool started, I did make a small group, but it was honestly super toxic so I had to break free. I couldnt deal with the constant threats and judgement. I left hating myself though and feeling out of place and like a loser. This went on for a while where I had one friend. Untill the end of grade 11, I got to this point where I thought maybe I should just end it, and that was just what I thought every moment. I was so close to doing it but these couple girls in my class started reaching out to me and pulling me along. I didnt tell them anything of course but they would just joke around with me and one of them was super flirty though I didnt read it at the time. I started to get to this happy high in my life, then I met a girl on a bus who sorta signaled for me to talk to her. We ended up dating for almost 2 years. Now one of the girls I met in class, Ill call her Angela, is a friend to this day. Throughout grade 12 we spent everyday together, we would always be togrther at lunch, or between classes. I met a lot of friends through her though, some of them I didnt vibe the best with. A lot of them were suspicious that we were dating, and her guy friends got jealous of me. So they started telling her I wasnt trustable and its sort of weird that we are so close even though I have girlfriend. But, I just vibed better with girls I found. She would rant to me, I would joke around with her, it was a fun friendship. We didnt text at all though so once we werent able to spend so much time together it got complicated. Ill get back to Angela later. My ex, the girl I dated from april grade 11, to december 2019, the end of my first semester of university. Ill call her Kayla.",

    "I need help overcoming envy Everywhere I look is someone who is better than me at something, or someone who looks happier than me. I try to fix this by practicing at being talented at one of my video games so that I for once have something to be proud of, but no matter what I do I just end up getting frustrated and start insulting myself constantly saying Im pathetic and I dont deserve anything or anyone because of this. This is especially the case in pvp games, that kind I most enjoy when im winning. Even outside of video games though I cant help but to get envious of literally everyone, even if they have their own life troubles I dont realise. I dont know what to do from here, every attempt at saying something good about myself has failed and I feel like I cannot go a day on the internet without seeing something that makes me hate myself again. How do I get rid of my bottomless supply of envy and low selfesteem and stop getting frustrated at my life?",
    "A happy lonely girl I have a girlfriend and she was diagnosed with clinical depression. She always seems happy, she likes to make corny jokes and we always enjoy each other. But there will always a day she will tell that she feels alone, that she hates herself that she cant even look herself in the mirror and says that shes a burden to everyone. It really hurts me everytime I hear those words from her. I always try my best to comfort her, even though Im not with her physically I will talk to her over the phone without hanging out the phone and watch her until she fell asleep because thats the only thing that I can do. Worst feeling is I dont know what to do or what to say to cheer her up whenever she feels that extreme sadness. Also even in regular days, she cant accept compliments. I love her so much that I want to be with her in always. I want to be her shoulder whenever she feel sad. I am not that knowledgeable about how to handle things like this so Im seeking some tips or anything that can help me help her in her battles. Thank you.",
    "27 yo Male, living with parents, having some family small businesses but personally having insignificant involvment. Dating an older women from other town. What should I do ? Hello everyone, I think about myself as an old child, unable to launch. Even though I started my own company, and began developing wordpress based websites, I havent earned much my whole life. I feel like a total st. For about a month Ive met a girl in a nearby city, who is 5 years older than me. She has a stable job with a much better income than mine, but she pays for rent and says that she cant save any money. Both of us are the only children our parents have. She wants a child soon, so she is looking for commitment, but on the other way, she says that she is not willing to limit any of my freedom. I was through a couple of bad relationships and I am not into hooking up randomly and not even dating anymore. I am very very frustrated and I dont know what should I do. Should I leave my parents, even if they need my help from time to time, take the nothing that I have and move with her? I am not confident, my schedule is a mess, I have a big problem waking up in the morning and I have no idea what to do. I sometimes wonder if I am semiretarded, or having some autistic spectrum disorder. I had problems with weed and alcohol and I incline towards addiction most of the time. I am stressed out nowadays because I have work which needs to be done, very limited time and little to no money. PLEASE HELP!! !",

    "Work is...... weird Been at my job for about 2 years, have had a good handle on depression and suicidal ideation the entire time, however it has been an extremely difficult month for me. HR pulled me in today and asked what changed my attitude from being generally upbeat to wearing a figurative Fuck Off Leave Me Alone sign on my forehead this month. I told them I was struggling with some home issues and now they seem overly concerned that Im not a good fit with the company. I dont think Ill lose my job but they seem to be harping on it alot. Do I just tell them straight up that Ive been close to killing myself every night for the past month? Or do I lie and say its something else?",
    "Did I destroy my brain and chances to be happy? I was on strong antidepressants since I was 15. I often abused drugs and alcohol. Back then I remember reading about how dangerous the combination of seratonin boosting stuff like ecstasy and antidepressants can be, but didnt care. I continued this risky game for about 3 years, when I was 18 and decided on my own I wouldnt need antidepressants anymore and immediately stopped taking them. I had horrible withdrawal symptoms  irregular heartbeat, almost passing out several times a day, cold sweat, dizziness, I felt like dying... so after a few days I took my meds again because I couldnt take it anymore... I lowered my dose each day until I felt like I could take the withdrawal symptoms. Now the thing is I am 21, have a girlfriend, have a fulltime job, but absolutely no joy in life whatsoever. I do absolutely nothing. I cant even bring myself to do the bare minimum. All I end up doing is swiping through social media and thats it. Every day off. My girlfriend likes to go out for dinner, the cinema, shopping, or even just go for a walk and so on. Shes basically dragging me along, I experience no happiness or joy, no matter what she suggests or what we end up doing. Theres just... nothing. Weve been together for 1½ years and I can tell shes getting exhausted. I am so sorry for her. Shes a wonderful person, I really love her, but she was so unlucky to fall in love with a person whos basically a wall.... Is there any chance I can fix what I fucked up in my youth?",

    "I need help While in the bootcamp, we rarely talked, living our separate lives. After I graduated bootcamp I moved to Washington State, to gain some world experience and she did the same thing, but interning in the Caribbean as a marine biology instructor. I started at this time having extremely unhealthy night terrors. I was still madly in love with her, I had a ring in mind from our first relationship and one night was exceedingly bad. The next morning I told myself that I would reach out to her, tell her the truth of what I was feeling. So I did. I told her about how much I missed her, my night terrors, why we separated and my insecurities about how she was feeling at the time. And I told her that I still loved her and either needed her in my life or I had to completely cut her out because my mental health was really bad. These night terrors are demons like no other. I hop no one has to be afraid to sleep because they may experience watching and hearing their ex get railed by guy after guy. It truly is a haunting experience. After I reached out she told me she had missed me, and felt the same. We talked about what things would be different and how we would be able to go on from there. She had 2 months left in her internship before she came back to the states. During this time we talked about the future, where she wanted to work, when we could see each other again, things we could do etc etc... The reason it was difficult is because I landed a job as a software developer in idaho that only pays 52yr. So plane tickets from Kentucky arent the cheapest. I also got us a hotel room and tickets to see one of our favorite bands tame impala. Well. When the day finally came where she returned to the states something happened. She did a complete 180 and told me she no longer wanted a relationship and wanted to be independent to travel the world and teach Marine biology. I was always supportive of this idea but the way she described it to me seemed that instead of a partner, I was more of an obstacle. And she eventually ended the relationship. I was hurt, really really bad.",

    "I am sad, alone and scared. Ive never been properly diagnosed with depression but I am currently feeling very depressed. A few years ago when I was younger amp my parents were going through a divorce I was severely miserable, would have large bouts of anxiety amp often contemplated ending my life. It was a sad time in my life but I am glad to say that I got through it and have been doing great for the most part and have hardly felt anxious since. However recently I have been feeling really down amp depressed. All I want to do is sleep and I eat because I am sad and bored, and then I become sad because I eat too much. I have gained weight and am so insecure. I have been skipping my uni classes because I have no friends there and my degree is hard and it all makes me so sad. With all my friends heading in different directions I just feel so alone. I think my family have noticed and say things that are kind of cruel, but I know they mean well. They think I have obsessive compulsive tendencies because I tend to pick at my face often amp struggle to stop. I just dont want to let anyone down amp I am afraid to take the steps to become better because I know it will disappoint my family if I decide to leave uni for example. But most importantly Im scared of going back to how I was years ago, I never want to feel that way again. Ive never reached out for professional help either and dont have the money for therapy. Part of me would feel also ashamed in a way if I got professional help. I hate the idea that something may actually be wrong with me, and I hate the idea of having to take meds. I just feel so lost and conflicted. I feel like I know what I need to do but its so hard to do it and remain consistent. If anyone has any advice at all it would greatly appreciated. Also, thank you if you read through it all.",

    "Alone in a new country. Feeling terrible. I wanted to make friends and get advice from people in the same situation as me. But now it feels like everyone is just a huge jerk, and Im the worst person in the world for daring to move to their country. Theyre expats too! Its making me feel so terrible. I havent been able to get out of bed for days. I wake up in the night sobbing. Ive stopped eating. I feel like Im not wanted in this country. Im feeling so stupid for thinking that moving here was a good idea. I feel stupid for being upset about it too. They were calling me a snowflake for just calmly asking about how to do a simple thing I didnt know how to do. So me being upset just proves them right. Everything they said about me is just the truth. I say it to myself everyday anyways. I feel bad telling my boyfriend how I feel because he works really hard all day, and comes home late and really tired. I dont want to bother him by complaining about my problems. Ive already talked a lot with him about it all, and hes really good at trying to make me feel better and listening to me. But I just feel so guilty, so I keep a lot of it in.

    "Anyone here have reverse seasonal affective disorder - i.e.: summer depression? If so, could use some advice It took me months to recover Bc I couldnt find any type of add on medication that I could tolerate that helped. During these spells I literally feel as if Im drugged  I am searching for words, I have no energy. I feel as if Im literally impaired or like I have taken a sedative. I understand it must sound dramatic, but Ive not been able to find anything medication wise that is able to help. I had a gene site test and Ive tried the meds listed in my green bucket and the side effects were so intense I couldnt continue on them, not to mention theyre not covered by our insurance so we paid over 1500.00 last summer on meds that didnt work. I find it difficult to find other people who have this and especially difficult to convey to my prescribing Dr. what Im going through. Additionally, I dont understand why it just happened so recently and without much warning like cause and effect. I have had depression most of my adult life and have been able to manage it with medication and lifestyle changes, but this summer thing is a different animal. Now its June and Im hoping that I can do some prevention as I feel like Ive exhausted meds. options. I have an appointment with my provider this week and I need to be as pro active as I can now in case I have this experience again. I just dont know what to ask for at this point, nor what to even do  or if I even have to do anything. Maybe it wont happen  I mean anything is possible, but I feel like I need to at least try to be prepared. Anyone have experience with this and any tips? I am thinking of preparing myself for a ketamine infusion or something this year. I just cannot imagine going through it again Bc it lasted so long this past summer well into the fall and I got to the point of being so low it was scary.

Hes become the brattiest and most rude child Ive ever seen. He used to be a very nice and polite kid, but now he knows he can get away with being a total asshole, so he constantly acts like a total asshole. He says stuff like give me the TV remote or Ill kill you and cut your eyes out, like horror movie scenarios. I get screamed at if I try to discipline him and tell him he doesnt need to be saying that sort of thing. If I was to do the same thing, I would be screamed at, told to get a job Im mentally and physically disabled, currently going through occupational therapy to help find me a suitable job, but this isnt enough to keep her happy, have things taken away, etc. Another brother of mine m, 14 completely agrees that my moms parenting is ineffective. My mom is nicer to him than she is to me, but shes still unnecessarily rude to him as well. Weve both tried bringing it up to her, but she just gets defensive and resorts to personal attacks against us both. For example, for me she would say something like well you dont work and youre taking all my money and for my brother she would say stuff like well youre just on your computer all day. She also defends her crappy parenting by saying you wouldnt understand, youre not a parent I may not be a parent and I dont plan on ever being one, but at least I know that no one, much less 4 year old children, shouldnt be punching people to get what they want and using threatening demands. I dont know how much longer I can keep taking all these attacks while my little brother is allowed to be a dick.

    "I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to keep going I posted yesterday, but things keep getting worse. So my spouse and I were given a 30 day move out notice because our depression mess was too much for them. Its not even thats bad, and weve been actively trying to get better, but they wouldnt work with us at all. My spouse called her mom today to wish her a happy birthday and her mom ended up asking a bunch of questions about our plan and what were doing, and my fiancée broached the subject of her possibly taking our cats. Her mom proceeded to freak out at her and say that she was being disrespectful and then yelled at my spouse for being manipulative when she started to cry. She then said that if we really cant find anything that we can move in with her, but obviously thats not something that any of us want. My spouse is currently sobbing in the bathroom, barely able to move, and I just feel so utterly fucking helpless and afraid. She told me that she wants to kill herself so fucking bad but that she cant because that would be unfair to me. I worry every fucking day that this will be the day that her will to live outweighs that guilt she feels for leaving me. I have for a long time. I used to come home when I worked an earlier shift from her and check the closet to make sure I didnt find her hanging there, and that was even when things were going relatively okay. I dont know how were supposed to do this. How do we get an apartment if were being kicked out in the middle of our lease? No one will want us with this on our record. Im terrified of if we have to go to her moms. I would suggest that just she move back in because I think part of her moms issue is with me and I find a couch to crash on until we can figure it out, but I worry that her mental state would get worse being at her moms without me, dealing with her mothers emotional abuse every day. Im terrified. I feel like Im spiraling out of control. My spouses mental health is so much worse than mine so Im the one who always has to be strong and supportive, but Im losing it.",

    "I just realized I'm very depressed but I don't know why. Before today, I didnt even know or even seriously consider that I may be depressed. To me it just seemed normal, and probably due to the gradual increase of the severity I simply didnt connect the dots. From what I can recall its been going on since I was around 12, back in 2014. First I remember becoming quite lazy and finding getting anything done an incredibly hard challenge. I thought it was just because I was a teenager, and lazyness is a normal teenager status. Then I started having a lot of anger issues, Id get pissed off for the most minute things, I had an incredibly short fuse but I just thought it was also normal teenager behavior. Eventually I managed to suppress those explosions so theyd go off in my head but no one would notice. I started to lose interest in things I used to enjoy a lot, like math, and went from reading 30 books a year to reading 0 last year. I think I was around 15 when the first suicidal thought occurred. Every time Id fuck up and get grounded or yelled at, or faced consequences for my actions Id just think over and over again that I wasnt worth anything. Those thoughts disappeared for some time, but arose back last year. I, again, thought it was normal. I think the reason they stopped is because I was at a relative high in my life, I had entered college at 16 years of age and everyone I knew was proud of me, and I felt good about myself. Or so I think I thought. I feel like I can speak for any teenager out there that mastubating is normal. Yet Im not sure when, it became a daily thing, and then 2 or 3 times per day. Also I stopped showering, I dont even know why. I just didnt. Id go into the bathroom, turn on the water and just sit on the toilet looking at it or my phone. I stopped cleaning my room and then stopped washing my clothes. Id wait till the last pair of underwear, maybe reuse it a few times and then wash enough clothes for a week, while months of clothes were piled up. My dandruff got much worse, and the suicidal thoughts came back every once in a while.",

I just dont have interest in engaging in my hobbies anymore. But I want to be able to enjoy them again! Ive tried scheduling time to do some of these things each week, but it has just made me dread doing them even more, as if they were more chores. Im interested to hear what techniques and skills worked for you to be able to enjoy life again.",
    "My ex husband dead because of me and I hate living I married my ex husband when I was 18. We had 2 kids together. I already had 2. There was ups and downs. Good times and bad ones but something that stayed constant was he wouldnt work. I went to nursing school with the promise he would take care of the home. This didnt happen. After 7 years of this and also quite a bit of mental abuse I divorced him. The kids started getting into trouble and were so upset. Plus to be honest I missed him. I went back. I did this for 8 more years. Meanwhile he had developed quite the tab habit. And me overdrawn everyday day trying to feed habits and kids. I didnt leave again til it got so bad he was needing stronger and stronger things and me and the 2 girls left at home had no running water or lights. It was hard without family. He begged and begged me to come back. Just like last time. He also played bad guy and even tried to get me fired. He died less then a year after we left. He was in a crack house. High on heroin and fentanol. His kids devastated. So now here am i.. with all the things ppl know I went through. And I have to be strong for the kids. But there was some good times too. Some only him and I shared. He understood me like no one else. He wasnt always a drug addict. Maybe I actually hoped subconsciously that he would get better and we could try again. After all I had never cared about anyone like I do him. All I know is I miss him so fucking much! I cry every day. I dont wanna live without him. Everything and I mean everything makes me think of him.. and Im so lost. I cant believe he left me. He left me here without him and it hurts so damn bad and I dont know how to make it stop. I just want him.... and all this im feeling roaring in me like a fire.",
    "Everything is a Blur Hey guys, ive been suffering a lot recently regarding depression and anxiety to be honest. I just wake up feeling awful, and my days are a blur, hell i cant remember what i was doing like 5 minutes ago. It genuinely feels like ive got alzheimers at times. I just feel like all the joy has been sucked out of everything as usual. Everything blends together, my depression and anxiety are collaborating each other on their next big project Make me feel as miserable as possible! shitty idea for a youtube seriesalbum, right?. Its either, feeling utterly miserable, useless and guilty with low energy and nothing to even look forward to during the day even though i should. Plus, i feel like ive lived a thousand years already and im just beginning to hate the world if im honest with how people are. Or its my health anxiety  Regular ol plain anxiety, with panic attacks, thinking im dying constantly even when im not having a panic attack. Whether or not its one of the two is all up to the wheel of misfortune that i spin most days, sometimes to keep things fresh and exciting it can be both at the same time! ampx200B Anyway, im looking for some support or some advice on what to do.

    "My relationship is imploding in on itself due to my depression... Long story short, Im a twice divorced single father to a 3 year old boy and Im a Staff Sergeant in the AirForce which Ive served the past 10 years. Ive been battling depression my entire career. Mostly due to trama of a neglectful and abusive childhood and made worse by divorces that followed. Ive been in and out of therapy for years. Now I am dating a wonderful woman who now live with me and mothers my son like hes her own. She also has a 5 year old daughter and when we first got together she was 2 months pregnant and we now have a beautiful new daughter. I have a new job in the Air Force as a Avionics Fundamentals Instructor and I love it. Ever with all this good happening in my life my depression is surging back. One of the biggest issues that its bringing is its completely destroyed my sex drive and I just dont have the urge for it in any form. So this is causing my girlfriend to feel very rejected even though she know why Im simple not interested in it. Dont get me wrong, Im still very attracted to her, shes absolutely gorgeous lol I just dont have any libido. But this accidental rejection is causing a huge divide between us and Im scared of losing her and my new daughters. Im starting up therapy again and seeking to get put on antidepressants again and I know it will help but Im worried Ill lose everything before Im back to my normal self.",

I dont even wanna leave my bed. I used to draw a lot and play the piano, but now im just miserable. I feel nothing. All thats happening in the world right now is just too much for me.

Before It all. I has to introduce myself right? My name... Well, I wont tell it. You can call me as you wish. Born early 2000s. I live in Brazil. Lets go. Like I said before, everything has start at all early 2019 I guess. I start to imaginating me fucking with some people especially my nieces one is a kid and another a baby and I cumming on it. This impacted me...you now? Suicide. But this happen to another people why this impacted me? I imaginated me having a pee pee on my friends girlfriend. Have a period of time that I imaginated people without their eyes. Actually has periods that I had fear of becoming blind. I dont if is because I have made jokes about a friend that have one eye blind. He have his moments of stupid speech but this dont justified what I have done. Have a time that I watched Gotham 2014 that Is a tv show. There is a Joker on the series, and for a period I wanted to be him, kill people you know? Why? Why? Why? Have a time in mid 2018 that I was in conflict religiously. I wanted to know that If god or satan really exist. I guess that Ive prayed for my mom die? Ive prayed to rain? For both? You know now Im in conflict with the numbers 12 and 18. My nieces have been born in years that ends there. I dont know what to do. I am racist? I cant have a relationship with women. Well, once I was masturbating and when I was going to thought the name of my niece. Once I was watching porn and remembered of the name of father of my friend. It happens with one of nieces too.",
    "How to get brave enough to kill yourself Especially seeing how the world responded to Covid Mostly the US and watching everyone bitch and moan how they cant go out or get haircuts while THOUSDANDS of people are dying is just so fucking disgusting. Humans have outstayed their welcome amp I honestly cant wait for the end of the human race. I have no interest in anything anymore and even if I did, like drawing, I immediately remind myself how pointless it is. Ive been drawing for a good chunk of my life and seeing children so far ahead of me in development and skill just makes me realize how Ive wasted my time on something so trivial. I have no messages or any grand ideas to out into the world. No one wants to see shit from a dumb ass white girl from LA. Well, a dumb ass ugly white girl I love animals but cant take care of them for shit amp I feel like Im always failing them. Humans do nothing but slay and enslave animals and we dont care how many have to go extinct as long as we get fancy things. Im taking up way too much space and resources. I could be happy and free by now sell all my shit and travel the world before kicking the bucket but instead I choose to run the rat race, get that tiny slice of bread and do what every other human does. Im too scared to do it but getting closer I think!! so this is what I deserve. I have shit planned like trustswills and how Id do it but I dont deserve peace. I cant even say really why Im coming to the internet for advice when I know exactly how itll turn out. Get maybe a few replies, mostly being trolls and the rest being a generic itll get better! crap I feel just wrong in this person suit that was not tailor made for me and theres no way of getting out except death. So I guess just any advice on how to better deal with being a worthless loser, how to hold up that smile so you dont make anyone else uncomfortable Or just changing yourself completely and how to ultimately gain confidence to fucking do what Ive wanted since middle school.",

    "Dae have a therapist that does this? Shes registered and a doctor so Im inclined to give her the benefit of the doubt, but honestly shes not been helpful at all. I want an outside perspective so that I can know if its on me or her. She talks just like a distracted friend instead of a therapist. 13 word responses. For example, I told her I was frustrated and felt lost about something, and she just said understand. Her solutions are things I could come up with on my own and basically boil down to her just saying no every time I bring up a harmful coping mechanism. I already know whats wrong with me and my life but not how to fix it! And she believes that I should talk the most in therapy but I dont feel heard when all she does is....listen? If that makes sense? I dunno.... Ive just been spiralling into a worse and worse place mentally and depending on her and getting this seems to be hurting more than helping.

    "How do I help my girlfriend My girlfriend 27 has slowly been sinking into depression, and I have no clue as to how I can help her. These last few months have been tough on her especially the last two. Her parents have started talking about divorce and its beginning to get ugly between them. Her mother calls her and vents about it and it usually leaves her angry. Her brother who has recently moved out of their parents house in January was just put in a psych ward for evaluation because his schizophrenia and paranoia have gotten the better of him since hes moved out. This is his second time being admitted. My girlfriend had a tremendous amount of pressure put on her for the last couple months from her parents to watch over him since they live out of town. Since hes been admitted her depression has crept up on her. Shes doesnt want to do anything but sleep and cry. Im always there by her side but do give her space for her self so that Im not overbearing on her. Lately shes been going on about how she wishes she could just end it all and kill herself because all her pain would go away and it would be easier. This isnt the first time shes said something along these lines. Shes never tried to hurt herself in that sort of way, but it does concern me. Shes been visiting a therapist lately and it seems to help her a bit but its only been her 3rd session, and she hasnt completely opened up on the subject with her. This morning she texted me that I havent been giving her the attention she needsdespite being with her and doing everything for her when I come home from work. Im trying really hard to help lift t her spirits and nothing picks her up. Even the dates we try to have do help. Half way through she wants to call it a night so she can go home to sleep and lay down. Im not sure what to do anymore. I love her to pieces and want the girl I fell in love with back but I dont know how to get her out of this funk.",
    "Loneliness It has come to the point in my life, where I just feel lonely. I know that there are people close to me, that there are people who care about me, but sometimes, I just feel lonely. I usually enjoy the feeling of being alone. I love sitting at a bench in the middle of nowhere in the darkest of night, when noone is around and nobody but the stars sees me. But I hate this loneliness... It creeps into me like a dagger, slowly pushed into my heart, wraps my brain and emotions in a blanket of coldness, softly whispering in my ear that Im alone...that no one really cares about me... I can fight against it, I can entertain myself to not feel it. I can figth it by talking to people, by making silly jokes or watching YouTube or playing video games. But sometimes, in the middle of the day, it comes creeping back to me. It seems to be around me all the time, just waiting for the moment, I let my guard down... Just waiting to close its hands around my throat and rip my heart right out of my chest... Dragging me down into an ice cold sea of nothingness and loneliness. I know this demon of loneliness is wrong. I know, that there are people who care for me and who like me... But still, I dont know how to win against this demon.",
    "Meds help - Sertraline Please help lol. TLDR at the bottom. I started taking Citalopram 5 years ago and tried to ween myself off them. When I did that, after I stopped taking them any little thing would make me angry or burst into tears. I was surprised at how much the meds actually effected me. So I asked doctor if I can change my meds entirely and went onto Sertraline, 50mg. I recently decided I dont want to be on these meds forever, and asked my Dr how do I stop them? He was no help whatsoever and said just half them etc and take it ever other day etc. I did that and now Im off them. But Ive noticed my moods changed. Any little thing that doesnt go right, I get really angry and I could burst into tears. Seriously all the time. Has anyone come off these and experienced what Im going through? Does it stop? Do you start to feel normal again? TLDR  Weened myself off Sertraline, little things that go wrong make me angry and cry. Does this stop? Will I feel normal again? When?",

    "I feel lonely even though there's no need to So I 25m gotta say that mostly my life is great  I have a lot of friends online amp offline and a lot of people like me for who I am which is very important for me. However  I have always been someone who was very lacking female contact. My whole life whenever I had female friends it was something very special to me and mostly those friendships were more important to me than to them. Always wanted to have a best female friend but after years where this wish never came true I gave up on it. At the moment I mainly have contact to two of my female friends. One is my ex girlfriend and we message each other occasionally. I know that shes very busy so naturally its rare for her to message me. But when we chat then its always very fun for both of us and we have a great time. And then nothing for like 1 or 2 months. I sometimes tell her how Im very happy when she messages me and stuff and then she always insists that its so rare because she has no time. So I can kinda cope with it. Then theres another online friend who I have known for roughly two and a half years now. We once were really close and even planned to meet up once but then quarantine hit and then the plan kinda fell into the water. Somehow the contact got less and less until it started again about a year ago. Mainly when its her or my birthday we keep saying how we should get into a voice call again and play some games like we used to. But then again when I ask her later she either says yeah we should do that soon or when she says I guess it could work out tonight she does not cancel it but at the same time I cannot reach her and the next day she says stuff like Sorry didnt work out. Im a very understanding person so I can easily accept that. However when you have planned something I think it should be your duty, if you post pone it, to message that person again and make a new plan. That doesnt happen. Last time she cancelled the plan nearly two weeks ago and I havent heard from her since.",
    "How do I (14 M) talk to my (Typical Indian) dad about seeing a therapist? Tldr at bottom Hey guys. So, for context I am a 14 yo dude from India. I have a typical Indian dad, so that means conservative and not so openminded, and we arent close either. We havent really talked about anything else other than studies and me being a failure in the past... 3 years or so. I have been depressed and suicidal for about 2 years now and have been cutting for about a year. I think I might have anxiety, but not really sure about that. So, with that in mind, heres whats I need help with About a month ago, I tried talking to my dad about my cuts. I went to him and showed him my recent scars and he asked what they were. I told him they were cuts with a razor blade and he didnt ask me why but instead started screaming at me about me not studying and that I cut myself because of Youtube As it had rotten my brain. He told me that he would have listened to me and helped if I had gotten good grades Like, above 95 but since I havent gotten good grades I have like a 7580 overall, he doesnt give a fuck. I couldnt even tell him about what was bothering me. The first thing I said was insecurities, and he said I dont know the first thing about being insecure. Then I said anxiety and he went on and on about how I have no anxiety and its all just due to Youtube. This went on and on and I just stopped speaking. Like half an hour in, he told me that I should just take a knife and slice my wrists so I can die once and for all and how it would be great and he wouldnt give a shit This was pretty descriptive. He told me exactly where to cut and how much time it would take me to die. Also, to slice them in the bathroom sink so the bedroom doesnt get dirty After like 1.52 weeks after this convo, he came into my room and told me that he got irritated because he couldnt understand what caused me to do it and he had cried later that night. Now I dont know if I should believe him or not.",
    "I feel depressed but feel like even more of a loser for feeling depressed. This might not resonate at all with some people. Its always been hard to explain. Ive never actually told anyone in this level of detail before. I have this overwhelming notion that im a loser. It always in the back of my mind but often times itll just overcome me a little bit. I struggle pretty occasionally with depression. Had about a year and a half in high school where it was really bad, never told anyone. Off and on in college, never told anyone. Overall I know a lot of people struggle with depression and many very likely have it much worse than me. Given that, I always felt the need to suck it up and control my attitude. Sometimes i think i do a pretty good job of it honestly. Pushing on and such. Ive always been able to put on a face paired with the fact that ive never given off the presentation of someone who is struggling deep down. Ill get to one thing that I think complicates things at least for me. I come from a really rich family. Pretty much a carbon copy of the daddys money type although one of the very few personal attributes ive been able to take pride in is my personality doesnt reflect it. I would say the fact that im an only child makes it even more surprising. As ive gotten older ive gotten much more grateful for how my parents have raised me in that sense. I graduated from college last May with a business degree that my parents paid for, of course. I have a stable job and i have a really great group of friends, most of which are elsewhere now for their jobsschool. Ive never really accomplished anything in life. Ive always felt like kind of a loser since high school. I was an average student. Pretty bad at sports even though I dedicated a pretty huge part of life to them at one point. I went to college far away. I graduated and went home and couldnt find a job in my field at all. I have a stable job now, albeit not something i wanted to do nor do i enjoy.",

I know I need to break out of this unhealthy way of thinking, but my brain just wont do it! I hate how I come across as lazy. Im exhausted. This is my third attempt at trying to get my Bachelors. I only have a semseter left. Each time I try to graduate, something horrible happens, I get hospitalized for suicide, I get assaulted, and my mother dies. Now Im constantly bracing myself for more suffering, and I end up creating it by panicking instead of doing my assignments. Im making this harder on myself then it has to be. I feel guilt for being a financial burden on my father, I feel shame for not moving on with my life like my peers. I hate not having friends, and being a hermit. I really dont want to move back in with my father, because he hoards, and my depression will only get worse. All I want to be is financially independent. I want to be a functioning member of society.

    "I’m just tired and want to feel nothing Ive never done a reddit post or anything before but essentially Ive been depressed for over 10 years 20 now and Im just really tired. For a brief summary Ive always struggled with family dad I dont get along with is an arse, mom who is mentally unstable herself but is in denial and is far to kind to the point that it hurts everyone the type to constantly be ripped off but to do the exact same thing again and again, exstep dad who made false promises and has gone off the edge of the earth, exstep mom whose a 14yr bitchy girl stuck inside a womens body, older sister who is very over opinionated and its her way or the high way and a little sister who is young enough that shes missed most the trauma but I dont get to see often because she lives with my dad I dont want to get into it because its a long story that has lasted all my life. Ive always really struggled with friends. I find it really hard to make them and when I did I would often get hurt so now theres just a wall. And Ive just really struggled with myself. All the usual low self esteem, anxiety, paranoia, depression. Im keeping it brief since I feel like I can write a book. Im a really lonely person and have been for a long time and I know its because Ive just never had a proper normal relationship with anyone. My family dont talk about emotions and all that and with all the trauma Ive always been very closed off with them ready to bolt as soon as I can. And since Ive always struggled with friends Ive just never had anyone around I have friends now but were just not good friends Im unsure how to explain it. Ive also never had a boyfriend so its always felt like just me. Im very used to people abandoning me so Im closed off. My depression has also just killed the things I love as it often does and I really struggled to enjoy anything or find motivation for it. I went to uni this year and dropped out after a month and still havent got a job. Ive been applying but havent made any cuts and for the one I made the cut for I couldnt do cause my anxiety was so bad.",
    "I’ve broken a year long streak of not cutting and now I can’t stop (long post I’m sorry) Its just about two months until my eighteenth birthday. Ive been having these terrible thoughts for almost as long as I could remember. It just started out as this awful feeling and its evolved into daily thoughts of suicide, nonexistent self confidence, what can only be described as extreme social anxiety, a constant feeling of loneliness, and self hatred. About two years ago I started cutting. I dont know why i started but i did it for almost a year. It took the pain away emotionally and made it all physical. It became something I could see and touch not just this oppressive darkness I feel on a constant basis. I knew it was an awful habit so I tried my best to stop. About three or four weeks ago things got really bad and I did it again. And now Im back to square one. I dont have anyone to talk to because my parents would send me to a hospital, my friends would stop talking to me, I have no significant other to share my thoughts with because I am completely unlikable and extremely awkward around other people, and my therapist refuses to do anything about anything I tell him. Every time my brain makes things bad I do it again and again and part of me wants to stop because i know its not good but at the same time I really dont want to because in some messed up way it makes things feel better. I feel trapped in my own mind and I dont really know what to do anymore. Thanks.",
    "I don't know what to do at this point other than end it. Nothing has helped so far. Title explains it in tbe most TLDR way possible, but Ill add another at the end if this ends up too long. Abuse, sexual assault, violence, suicide, self harm, NSFW, and addiction is all mentioned. Tread with care. ._. Just a little background I am an 18 year old preeverything FTM in high school. I live with my parents and my disabled younger brother. I almost attempted suicide last night, I guess. A friend talked me through it and helped me fall asleep, but now that Im awake all the feelings have just come back. I have been casually suicidal for like, 2 years at this point and have attempted suicide twice before. The thing is, I really dont want to die. I just want it all to stop hurting. Its just that nothing Ive found so far can make it stop hurting. Id just.. really like some advice about where to turn now, thats all. And maybe some validation or support. A lot of things have happened over the course of my life, and it gets really long. So like I said, Ill add another TLDR at the end, but here are the events that have lead up to now, listed neatly in chronological order. I have a lot of memory gaps, which I assume is a defense mechanism against trauma, so I will try my best. Before I was born, my parents who had met at 12 and 13, and are still married at 41 and 42 were severely abusive to each other. Physical fights, using weapons or objects to harm each other, severe emotional abuse. My mom tells me about a time she kicked my dad down the stairs 3 times while he was drunk, just for fun, and laughed at him each time. She laughed about it as she told the story despite the mortified look on my face. I swear, theres something wrong with her. Both of my parents had really bad home lives growing up, apparently, but my dad especially. Anyway, my dad was an alcoholic troublemaker who always ended up in juvy, or eventually jail. My mom was some sort of sick twisted bitch or whatever.",
    "Advice/Help Hi there! So I decided to create a new Reddit account to write this. Im not sure if this is the right subreddit  but thought Id want to just talk about things. I have been dealing with anxiety for around 3 years now, and have been experiencing depressive symptoms for around a month. I dont want it to sound like Im complaining  but I just feel exhausted. Im tired of always trying to be better, to improve and hoping that things will change. I had seen different psychologists over those 3 years, and although one had worked really well for me  the rest felt like I was just talking about my problems without actually coming up with a solution. Honestly, it feels a little bit surreal for me to even be writing a post  because Ive tended to lurk reddit for so long and just read things. I know people say that things will get better, and yes  there is COVIDlockdown. I just become so angry with myself that Im not improving at the rate that I really want to be. And I honestly dont even know where to start to initiate that improvement. I guess I just really want help.",
    "What can I do to stop being a weirdo? But at the same time if I stay calm, I feel like Im boring the person and then I panic and then I start acting like a weirdo its a never ending cycle Im constantly daydreaming because I hate my current situation and weirdly enough when I imagine talking to someone my lips move and it seems like Im talking to myself which is super embarrassing. Daydreaming takes my mind off of everything, but its super depressing when I stop and I come back to reality Im a lot better now and I dont daydream as much I constantly feel like Im under so much pressure Im not feminine in any way. I dont care of my appearance and I smell but I just dont feel like taking care of myself, I know its a crappy excuse. I feel so masculine and I hate it. I love being a girl, but I dont know why I cant bring myself to act like one. I sit like a man too. As weird as it sounds, I feel like Im watching myself play a character. Almost as if Im not allowing myself to be my true self because I think Im boring. I dont know why I cant allow myself to slow down. Im always rushing myself and I have to do everything at an unusually fast pace. Im so erratic with everything, whether it be me talking to someone or walking. I dont know what to do about this. I dont know if its because my family have always called me insane and as an act of rebellion, maybe Im acting like that because I believe it too. I dont think Im insane but, maybe Im wrong? Its driving people away and its driving me insane. Im not aware of my surroundings and it really pisses people off, including myself. I really need some advice and I want to know why Im acting like this and what I need to do to be a better person.",

    "DAE Want to reach out for help but know it could just make you feel worse? Im going through a backslide right now and I almost want to ask those around me for help on things like checking in to make sure I got out of bed today or have eaten something since I have a tendency to starve myself. I feel like I should be open about what Im dealing with, but I also know that if I do, Ill feel weak, like Im putting my illness on their shoulders, and that theyll suffer because of me. I was suicidal not long ago and I feel myself returning to some of the thoughts that accompanied those feelings. I feel terrible for what I must have put them through, thinking I was going to die and the last thing I want to do is put them back in that position. I feel guilty asking them to help me because I dont know if they can break me out of negative cycles. Only I can get myself in a healthy mindset. Asking them to help feels selfish since Im bringing back all their worry when Im not sure they can really help. Is it a bad idea to fight this alone? Has anyone else experienced something similar?",
    "Just been rough for the past month I dont really know what Im hoping to get by writing this but, Ive been doing really poorly lately. I get up, I work for 910 hours straight consulting job, then I feel too exhausted to do anything else... I go to the gym at night, then I pass out and do it all again. Ive been so miserable and so overwhelmed, and I hate myself for being so incapacitated. Most of all, I think Im freaked out by feeling like itll always be like this. Ive been putting so much effort into keeping my baseline up  I eat regular meals, I sleep 8 hours, I work out, I meditate, Im on antidepressants, and Ive been going to therapy for two years. Ive been feeling better, but again I still feel like shit, all the time. I cant stop belittling myself. Its so scary, and it makes me so angry. I dont understand how everyone around me, my family and friends, can go through the same stressors as me and be fine. And not feel concerned about their work, their relationships, if what theyre doing is enough, and not be exhausted all the time. I feel so alone in this. My parents and friends dont really support me in this the way that I need them to, and I snap at them, and then I feel bad because I know theyre trying their best, and they dont need to be here for me at all. I just feel trapped in my own anxious thoughts, alone.",

Each time Ive forgiven him and moved on. But this time was different before it was mostly through texts and occasionally kissing. This time I found out he actually had sex with the girl and lied to me until there was no way he could. He promised that it would never happen again and that he never wants to hurt me this way again but even though I want to forgive him and move on I have been having a lot of uncomfortable thoughts and I have been picturing things and although I am still very attracted to him intimately it has been hard not to let it get to me during it.

    "First post ever, need help This is my first post ever. Im not diagnosed because Im scared to ask my parents to take me to see someone. Severe anxiety and depression along with bipolar disease are all common in my family. Im the only one who hasnt gone to therapy. I cant remember being truly happy. I remember all the way in kindergarten, so anxious about starting first grade, I had sleep paralysis for the first time. I cry constantly in private. I feel trapped in my parents expectations. I would love to be sad on the outside and just cry it out sometimes, but they expect me to be happy. I play softball and volleyball, I used to do kickboxing. My parents expect me to be a badass who smiles while they kick ass. Ive been hiding how sad, alone, and numb I feel for years. I have addadhd I cant get a straight answer from my mom so its hard to focus. They offered me meds, but my mom said no. I was bullied severely last year, I was told to kill myself several times. Im going in to high school in a different school district. Im coming out of a funk, but I know Ill go back down in a week. My parents yell at me for everything. My sister has called me fat, ugly, and stupid for as long as I can remember. I dont know what to do or who to tell. I broke down and cried for hours on end to my best friend. She understood and was shocked because of how Ive hid it all these years. Can anyone offer any advice. Anything anyone can offer will be appreciated.",
    "Stuck between moving forward and killing myself Though I dont see the point of putting in all this effort to do things if it doesnt make me happy. I dont even have the energy or motivation for it. Every time I hear someone say Move on!, Man up!, Do this or do that, I already feel the pressure and it cripples me. Its not even that I dont want to do it. I really want to live a good and healthy life, but its like I am incapable of doing so. Seeing other people getting further in life also paralyzes me as well as watching vids on how to improve myself. Everything just scares me and paralyzes me. Still, I know its the only way out of this and my only chance of ever getting her back. However, there is no guarantee Ill get her back. So that thought is depressing on its own. And dont get me wrong. I know there are other girls out there. That is not the problem. I am not ugly and I can date girls, and I have done so for months already. I have had bad dates and great dates, and I have met great girls I could picture a relationship with, but it simply doesnt do it for me. I want my ex. Even when I put all the emotions aside and try to rationalize it, then I still want her. Right now I just feel trapped. Moving forward wont make me happy. It is not enough. Though sitting still and doing nothing wont make me happy either. At this point, suicide seems like the only solution, but even that is a scary and hard thing to do. However, I feel its the right thing to do as I feel far too broken and useless to continue this unsatisfying life. I wish there was some magical solution. I wish my ex would give the benefit of the doubt. I wish she would give me another chance. I wish she would make that sacrifice to help me. Though I know that that is ridiculous. I know that I have to do it all by myself that it is my responsibility... but I cannot do it anymore.",

    "I'm lost in life Hey Reddit, so Im looking for some kind of advice here. Im 18 y.o right now, and I dont know what to do in my life. Right now Im studying in university for some kind of IT and security and I absolutly hate it. For the 5 days I havent understood a single world. So yeah, Im stupidnot judging just by the university, Ive always been like this, just sitting and dont understanding shit, also I got almost no social skills, I dont really like peoplejust kinda avoid them, Im not talented at anything, Im not skilled at anything and I dont like anything. Everything I do I hate, really hate. So yeah, right now Im in some kind of situation, where I dont really know what to do next. University is too hard for me, and I think I will drop out aftwr first exams because Im too stupid too understand this and hate this too much to force myself to study. I asked my friend about all this things and he told me some stuff like yo go find yrself, or yo, just do things. But it sounds stupid for me. Im so fcking tired of trying something, and then after investing time finding out that you suck at it, and also you suck at many many other thing aswell. I realise all those thing like that I need to try, because else I will never know, I need to talk to people e.t.c but I cant force myself to do it. Also I never had a girlfriend, and I dont think I ever will have one, because Im too uninteresting and unattractive to date me or even talk to me. I dont really look after myself because at this point I dont really care. And probably if I fail my exams at my university Ill just commit suicide, because I dont see a point in living anymore, I just need some kind of trigger to help me make that decision.

Mornings are terrible. I have no hope that I can continue on a normal career path. I feel as though I am less than 1 of the person I can be. Ive always struggled with social interaction. Every interaction gives me anxiety. The panic that I often feel during interactions is similar to wave a adrenaline you get from a roller coaster. The panic doesnt allow me to gather any thoughts and remain present in the conversation. My mind just thinks get out at all times.

I fear starting afresh My wife has been the main financial support in the family and shes doing way better than me. However the saddest thing I found out recently was that she is also very stressed out and unhappy with her job. The only reason why she is staying on is because I am not financially stable.

    "Could you read me? Since then it was just blocked from my mind. ampx200B At age ten, I didnt wanted to be known as a woman anymore. But my classmates didnt wanted to accept me as a boy. So I started to become very reclusive. Around that age I discovered horror films. And for the first time, I connected with male figures. It was Michael Myers, Freddy, leatherface. They seem to be treated just like me. And I started to wish to kill my mother. I would play with knives all the time, imagining to be a serial killer. It appeared to be my destiny. Next year, at 11, I receive the shocking news. My mother is pregnant, and the baby is a girl. I was indifferent to the girl until she was born. Im so ashamed by this but I desired to rape her many times. One day, it was perfect to do it. It was only me and her. It was until I looked to her face. She was just a baby, I couldnt do this to her. I cried so much and I promised to myself that I wouldnt ever cause any harm to that girl. Ever. So I started to repress my admiration for psychopaths, and told myself that I wouldnt ever kill anyone. It seemed like the right thing to do. And it was ampx200B When I was 13, I tripped to my grandmas house, just like every year. My cousin, who is one year younger than me, was, probably the only boy I ever know that didnt saw anything wrong with me or that way I was. Actually, I spent the best times of my childhood playing with him. But at 13, something changed. One day, we were together, watching a film. He started to touch my butt and I was uncomfortable, but somehow, I wanted that. He grabbed me and was trying to have sex. I denied several times but he was being violent, almost stroking me. Somehow I liked the violence. I was enjoying that way he was telling me to shut up. I consent to him so anal sex with me.",

He made several attempts of suicide. 7 years ago he died of heart attack. my mom hasnt been the same since. she is her funny, joyous self but ever so often she gets extremely emotionaleither sad or angry. shes a homemaker, lost interest in her hobbies, my dad is so not supportive in fact is verbally abusive, doesnt have solid friends not her fault, its hard making friends when youre not well, and my sister isnt the best to her. I havent been home for a LONG time. I only recently came back home. I knew she was slightly depressed but now, observing the way she talks, behaves, her extreme bouts of anger or sorrow makes me think shes depressed or even has a borderline personality disorder.

Ive been paranoid ever since that when i live with someone they are secretly recording me. How do i stop this?? Its driving me insane because i know logically its ridiculous but i cant convince my emotions of that. Any help would be appreciated.",
    "I started isolating myself again Struggled with depression for a long time, Im currently doing ok in my life. I got sick a few weeks ago and cancelled all my plans, since then Ive really struggled with making any. After work I sometimes message some people but mostly just watch TV. Every weekend my parents go out to meet friends and I stay at home alone. Ive slowly been getting back to messaging and calling certain friends, but I keep avoiding or cancelling making plans. This is partially due to low energy but also because my self hatred is so bad that Im convinced all these lovely people secretly hate me and dont ever want to spend time with me and Im doing them a favor by not being in their lives as much",
    "My sister told me that she wants to admit herself. What can I do to help her? My sister messaged me today sharing that she wants to admit herself. I am about four hours away from her at the moment. I shared suicide hotline numbers with her and told her to call the nurse hotline number on the back of her insurance card. I have never dealt with this process, but I want to make sure she doesnt face any barriers during this difficult time. Is there anything I can do to help her in this process? We are in California.",
    "Advice on how to deal/make progress So, Im currently in a hole with my depression, and I could use some advice on what to do and ideas on how to approach things, as Ive done a lot already. Its a bit of a story, but I will keep it as brief as possible. If youre reading this and want to help, thanks in advance! So depression has been a thing all my life, but I only got a diagnosis around 10 years ago Im 33. I am also disabled, having a diagnosis of autism and suffering from chronic fatigue. I got therapy, and eventually, medication. The therapy CBTlike didnt really help, but at least talking to someone was nice at times I had a good therapist. The medication did help. I was put on 50mg sertraline. Fast forward a few years, and I start to do worse. I get sick with bowel pain that appears to be persistent. A few other difficult things in my life happen, and my depression starts coming back. The pain eventually becomes so hindering I have to stop work entirely. I get a pretty intense comprehensive therapy program for dealing with unexplained symptoms, and it is overwhelming. I lapse back into deep depression. The decision is made to up my dose to 100mg sertraline, and I climb out of it. The lessons I learn from therapy eventually help, and helps me control the pain and lessen it somewhat, although the fatigue actually intensifies. Fast forward to around now, covid times. Turns out, telling someone with a tendency for severe depression stay inside and have as little contact as possible is a recipe for bad times. I live in a place where I dont have a social network, a result of them moving away and me trying but so far being unable to because disability and dependency on social housing, which is a mess. So events were very important to me, and theyve all been canceled now for about a year and a half. I honestly do pretty well for around 10 months longer than I expected, before things get bad and I seek out my psych again. The decision is made to up my sertraline dose to 150mg, although I note I am seeing a pattern of it stopping working every 3 years.",
    "Depression-Why is every remedy have a placebo effect on me? And why can it never stay longer then a week? Im talking literally any type of treatment for my depression. Some examples Tried Celexa, the following week the depression had lessened cuz i had so much faith in this pill cuz it helped my friend then when it was when it was supposed to start working they say all antidepressants take at least a month to work which was around the time my back to normal depressed me depression came back. Of course they would sometimes up the dose just to see, but it never had the same impact as the first few days did. Tried Ashawagandha amp Holy basil adaptogens amp felt relief of anxiety for a few days, then back to same old GAD self cuz i have faith in natural remedies Tried yoga amp exercise, but hard to keep up with when im too depressed amp anxious amp its freezing out to leave the house . id workout more in my house if the ceilings werent so low amp i had more privacy i hate being watched, yes even if someones in the other room doing their own thing amp not even looking at me Tried eating more healthy not saying i eat unhealthy, felt good for like a meal then nothing, but im such a picky eater its hard to always eat the right stuff Tried Positive affirmations, about 115 times it can give a little relief, but nothing that a deep breath couldnt do Tried deep breathing, helpful to slow down breathing when anxious but extremely hard to remember to do Tried amp still trying therapy, but ive had multiple therapists amp after a bit it just turns into a choreexhausting to continuously bring up like yep, today i get to bring up my depression again amp remind myself of all the bad stuff yet again. idk im feeling quite hopeless. and the most frustrating part is that since im literally thinking my way into something working, like why cant i just do it myself? or like why doesnt it stay? i really dont understand ..",
    "I don’t know what’s going on And I hate it. Im not a weak person, I was so dedicated to soccer, and I was full of motivation like a Month ago, I dont know what happened. I decided to just take a step back and figure it all out, where these feelings are coming from. I realized that I have something deep inside of me, but I dont know what it is. Its so much i have to keep digging. For 2 weeks Ive stayed up thinking and praying and just trying to figure it out. I didnt know I was hurt, I didnt know I was lonely, I used to Just say fuck it, fuck feelings, pro athletes make it big because they dont let their feelings get in the way. And For a while it worked. Until it didnt. I keep unpacking and unpacking. I dont know what to do. I tell myself Im going to turn my life around but every morning I fail. Im on my way to being bed ridden, its just a matter of time. Im losing motivation day by day. I dont know what to do. If I ask my parents to take me to a therapist theyll just shrug it off because they wont believe I have depression. I dont even want to have depression, and I want to believe that I dont even have it. But I dont know. I guess I just need to let it all out you know? I feel so alone. I feel lonelier in school and in class with 25 other people in the room than I do in an empty house. I feel lonelier in a crowd than I do just being alone in my bed room. I dont have anyone in my life who will really care about me you know, like take the time to understand me. I know my parents care, but they wont understand me, and trust me Ive tried. Theres such a divided of culture and philosophy between us. Theyve come from a poor background and worked their way up to have a stable and happy life with me and my brother. They never felt depressed, they never looked back, they just worked and kept going.",
    "I'm terrified Im terrified that Im going to spend the whole of my life wanting to die. Im scared of suicide and dont want to attempt it, but Im also afraid of living.

I havent spoken to my best mate in days a long time for us, and Im both terrified of losing him and of letting him down by being a burden. I just..cant pretend to be happy with him right now, but I dont want to bring him down to my level either or worry him. Hopefully hell forget about me.... holy fuck, what if he forgets about me? Im afraid of becoming overwhelmed by work, but I cant seem to get myself out of bed and get the work done. Im too scared to face it. Im scared of leaving my room in case I see roommates. I dont want to talk to them or for them to see me like this. I need to eat but Im afraid of going out to buy food. I know Im spiraling. I know the depression is taking over. Im terrified of that happening, but at the same time I dont know if I WANT to be in control any more. Im too scared of that too. Fuck. Im just afraid. Of everything.",

    "Making the same mistake years later. I knew she was back in town, later on I ended up at a house party where I got in to a very bad state with drugs and alcohol. And out of all the placed I could of met her again she walked in to the kitchen where I was dashing out lines of cocaine in a state where I could barely stand or speak. I tried telling her I wasnt the man I was when we first met, but of course she didnt believe it, why would she ? Somehow I managed to achieve some sort of success with her. We danced and kissed etc. But shes probably just lonely since coming back to town since most of her friends are gone away. We never had sex that night but I couldnt have sex even if I wanted to due to state I was in. I woke up next morning and all my feeling for her came back, all the love it took me years to forget, but I knew that it was over, it was just a one night thing. It crushed me. All these years breaking away from my habits wasted when it came down to a person it mattered. I was still the same lying drug addict in her eyes as I was 4 years ago. Its been a week and I feel empty, only emotion I have is constant hint of anger and sadness in me. I stopped eating or doing anything except working , I work 95 and then I go to my garage where I work on projects and drink alcohol until am I able to sleep. Maybe I am still the same scumbag I was 4 years ago. Iv been having suicidal thoughts but I know I cant do that since I need to look after my family. I would rather suffer myself then let my family suffer. At first I thought it was just a comedown from drugs since I havent touched them in so long. But I still miss her more and more everyday. I have dreams about her at night where we are happy together. I messaged her a few times but shes always busy and takes a long time to reply. Im just so lost, all these years to recover just to slip back into my old days when it mattered the most. She gave me an opportunity to fix what I once broke but instead I proceeded to ruin it further.",

I dont have many friends in the first place and I have hopes of finding a romantic relationship with a girl, but now I absolutely hate talking to people I dont know. Maybe I didnt talk to the right people, but I feel like its something more. I dont get very anxious in social situations, so I dont think it could be social anxiety.

    "Years of worsening chronic fatigue/fog continue to cripple my life Hey everybody, My life itself has always been pretty good, but my quality of life has been awful for the last 8ish years. I am currently 23, and this is a quick timeline of whats been going on  Age 1314, started experiencing general anxiety for no apparent reason. Also, felt stressed a lot for no real reason either. Doctor thought it might be anxietydepression so suggested I see a therapist and try some antidepressants. I tried a couple antidepressants and saw a therapist with no success. Antidepressants did absolutely nothing, and therapist was at a loss as to how to help. This generalized anxietyworrystress feeling continued. Age 16, while still dealing with the above, I woke up one day after a good nights sleep and felt a little tired. I attributed it to anxiety or stress from school, but it NEVER went away. But it was very mild, so I just let it go and tried making lifestyle changes with no success. Over the months and years, it has very gradually worsened to the point where Im at now where I can hardly function due to the overwhelming fatiguebrain fog. It is 247. Not even a second of feeling better. Age 17present Have had nearly every sort of medical testing one can have done, many of them multiple times. Food allergy, vitaminmineral deficiencies, thyroid, cortisol, testosterone, heavy metals, MRI, EEG, EKG, Lyme disease, Epstein Barr, h pylori, sleep apnea, dietary changes, sleep schedule changes, increase exercise, etc. Have tried a total of 7 different antidepressantsanxieties from different drug classes to see if maybe depression was the culprit. All either did nothing or made me more tiredfoggy. Ive tried Vyvanse, Adderall, Ritalin, kratom, CBD, kava, and countless other supplements. The stimulants all either helped very slightly, but felt very artificial and made my body more anxious but didnt help my mind, or didnt do anything. Caffeine in any form doesnt help either.",
    "Being a teenager sucks Hi, To preface this Im going to sum up myself. Im a lonely geek teenager thats an only child with no pets, like stereotype computer geek. I just got back into physical classes again after 2 years doing online ones which I preferred I just moved and am having a tough time making friends and a tough time with my parents Were in a small apartment while ours gets renovated so Im sleeping on the couch and then going to school with no privacy really. My parents always try to turn the tables on me and then make things my fault or make me do things then insult me for things Im forced to do. I got some clothes a while ago I said I didnt like and I said I didnt like the fit , so I didnt wear them, now its my fault that I asked for them or other times they just say that I have to wear stuff because they say so. It feels like every night theres a screaming match between me and my dad or my parents , my mother is always seemingly depressed or has an attitude , I dont have friends and dont know how to make any. I just really dont know what to do. Teenagers nowadays dont care about Linux or old music , all they wanna listen to is shitty rap and use fucking tiktok. When we went to my doctor I had to take an exam where I have high signs of depression and my parents were told I should see a psychologist , that never happened of course They have alcohol with breakfast, lunch, and dinner which doesnt help either and it always feels like the standards are against me and that everything I do gets judged. They treat me like they own me and like I cant speak. Because no matter what I think my mom is always more important all she does it cook and smash I swear to god I really dont know what to do. Ive tried offing myself in the past and my mom laughed at me and screamed dont be ridiculous. I tried to come out as LGBT to them and was made fun of and still am and I have to lie that Im not. It makes me so angry seeing other people in classes and knowing they have pets and siblings and loving parents , and I dont. We just want the best for you Telling me to off myself and that everything I do isnt goof enough doesnt fucking solve that.",

My depression is bad, my anxiety is going crazy, basically, my fight or flight mode is going awol. I will be fine in my room watching YouTube or reading my book and Ill have this hot, panicking feeling in my stomach and its always in the evening. Not to brag, I also cant sleep anymore because of that feeling. I push my friends away. I deleted Facebook and Snapchat so they couldnt contact me, I didnt go to my graduation and I know when I talk about this stuff to my friends I know Im pissing them off when I keep telling them the same things Im going through and that every few weeks I tell them to forget me. They say its fine and they care but I can tell that they find it uncomfortable. I saw them for some graduation drinks after they convinced me to meet them. I really tried to be okay, telling myself it will all be fine, but it wasnt. I got there and when I saw them I felt angry, jealous, bitter and out of place they were discussing their new jobs, girlfriends, graduation, they were happy and I was sat there just drinking and was furious that they were happy and okay and Im sad and alone what sort of person does that. Its a weird complex where I love them and want to see them but when I do Im really sad and want to be alone forever and when Im alone I want to see them, and the cycle continues.

First things first I created this account because I dont feel comfortable using my regular one, and this is the first post Im making with it, but Ive been a Redditor for the better part of a decade. Please dont hold my desire to remain anonymous against me. Thank you. Now that thats out of the way, heres why Im posting Im a 45yearold guy and only now have realized that Im just sitting around waiting to die. Most people wouldnt know that by looking at me though, because on the surface Im a happy, friendly, outgoing person, but on the inside I just feel empty and hopeless. I cant sleep, Ive overeaten to the point of morbid obesity, I have no friends, my relationship with my wife feels distant, I dont get out and go anywhere, I dont exercise, I have no career ambitions even though I have a steady job, and I just generally have given up on everything and I feel like Im just going through the motions. Its been like that for years. I lost my dad in the 90s, my mom died 12 years ago, my fatherinlaw died a year after that, my brother has stopped speaking with me, I broke my leg a few years ago and it never healed back as well as I wish it had, I hurt all of the time, and my quality of life has plummeted. I know I need to seek help, but I dont know how to go about it without feeling like a failure. The idea of medication repulses me, and opening myself up to a total stranger seems like a nonstarter, so I dont know what I should do. As a result, Ive done nothing, and my health is only getting worse. If anyone has ever been in shoes like mine, how did you fix the problem? What did you do to change? How can I even get motivated to seek help and support when I cant even motivate myself to exercise, eat healthy, or talk about stuff like this with my wife? I just feel like Im surrounded by dead ends and all I can do is fake it until death finally solves my problems for me.",

When it gets like this, I would rather have nothing. I cant see the value in any of the struggle and the pain and suffering.

I had a conversation with my brother recently and he was talking about how im going to be applying for top universities and how I could get business scholarships to help pay for it and secure a job placement if im one of the top performers which I could be, and how I need to consider the amount of debt ill be in from it when I get married, buy a house, get a car, have kids etcetera. I just... dont feel optimistic about my prospects anymore. I dont even care about the debt, I cant see myself ever buying a house and I cant even bring myself to imagine having a so and kids. All I want to do is go to bed and not move from under the covers... I dont know when this even happened.

    "Self-Improvement help As I said this is not the first time this happens to me and would probably not be the last one if I dont force myself to change. Probably, right now I should focus on getting out of the postbreakup depression filling the void she left, new hobbies, activities... and move on but there is a lot in me Id like to improve, just to name a few  Manage amp control emotions better  as you can gather from all the previous  Be more confident My confidence is not the worst but I find it lacking most of the time  Have better human relationships As I mentioned I dont have too many friends. I usually have a hard time accepting new people into my life. Most of my human interactions feel fictitious, most I get lately are from work not real friendships. I can go entire weekends home alone without no one contacting me, thus, feeling lonely. I am mostly an introvert, I once saw a post of another fellow introvert that said the best days of his life where when an extrovert adopted him. Never a post has spoken so much to me. Social anxiety Not super bad in my case but I tend to get anxious in large groups, especially if I dont know anyone. I tend to feel uncomfortable and out of place. Be less clingy I have always been the one dumped and I always have a hard time accepting it, probably easy to understand bearing into consideration the previous points. I have not much of a clue where to start from, however. I believe Ive seen people recommend meditation but I never was too sure about it, maybe I should give it a go? Or selfhelp books? Courses? Seeing a psychologist or some other kind of therapy? My most sincere thanks to anyone that goes through this entire post, I wanted to keep it short but oh well.",
    "Please give me some advice. I really need it. Hi! This is my first time talking about my problems online so I will write a lot. If you stay to read everything, thank you, I appreciate it, because I really need it. So, I am almost 17 and I have depression since back in secondary school. I am always isolated by my colleagues, who only use me when they need to. Even so, I am always there for them although not the other way around. In my country being selfish is in power, but my parents raised me to be kind and modest so its pretty hard for me to find any friend. Besides that, my parents treat me very badly, always yelling at me or punishing me out of nothing, sometimes pretending I dont even exist. They dont believe me even if I tell the truth and dont ever encourage me. Because of that i became shy and introverted. The only friend I had , who started talking to me two years ago, becaming my bestfriend and also my first love later, changed completely when she got into highschool, got a boyfriend and threw me aside even if I told her about my depression and she knew I really needed her. Now I am alone and I got used to it, but I need someone be there for me and my loneliness only makes me feel more depressed. I always avoid going out with my parents because I feel like shit with them but I hate myself for it and their disappointed looks break my heart. The only way to escape from reality is my phone, but I started using it too often, watching night after night anime even if I have severe myopia. I constantly feel tired, I have no motivation to do anything, I dont seem to be able to love someone anymore and I really cant see myself in the future. The reason I write this is because today I had a nightmare with that girl and when I woke up my chest was hurting so bad and I screwed up with my parents. If anyone has come so far, thanks again, and sorry about my bad English. I really need some advice  What should i do? How can I escape this?",

    "I'm not sure how to tell my mother I'm depressed Trigger warning NSFW  there will be mentions of self harm Before anyone jumps to any conclusions please know I love my mother. Shes has an interesting way of handling situations. She just wants best for me and everyone and doesnt know how to handle certain situations. I think the beginning was 7th grade. Its the age when Im told kids around my age go through their adolescent stage. They become defiant of their parents and so forth. Im not sure if this is applicable for everyone but I was one of the kids who defied their parents and acted like a brat. Im certain from grade 7 it was just my teenage phase but now Im not sure because at grade 8 and 9 these mood swings got progressively worse and I began to act more sad than just moody. In grade 9 I ended up going to the office to have a talk with the counselor. Dont shame me for this but I had just began to use social media and my account was small so only my friends knew my account. Maybe it was for the better but I had posted on my story that I was going to ct myself for everyone friend of mine. During this time my family was in the rough. My parents were talking about divorce because they were living apart for too long and their gears just didnt click well together after being apart for too long and just recently getting to live with each other. I dont know what had gotten to me because I probably shouldnt have posted such a sensitive topic but I posted it but didnt completely follow through with it. I did very minor scratches. Maybe I was seeking comfort and attention. Anyways, I had posted it, this concerned my friends and it went all the way to the schools counselor and I ended up having a talk. I just bawled during the counsel meeting and asked if this would get to my parents and the counselor said yes. I didnt want to let my parents know because it would simply add fuel into the fire with my parents constantly talking about divorce. Anyways long story short this got to my parents and things got just a bit messier. My parents fought and mentioned my problems and blamed one another and it was difficult.",
    "I got into rpg commu to escape reality but It made my depression got worse. Im 22 years old who currently struggling with film thesis in my senior year. My thesiss topic is hard and its stressing me out. And I found this community where you draw a character and roleplaying with others character in some sort of setting like MMORPG. So I decided to use it to escape from some stress from my works. But it turned worsen. I have no friends there and its like everyone is knowing each other. I know the fact that I didnt active much because of my works and Im kind of confident in my drawing and painting skill Im parttime freelance artist. But nobody played with me or make their character talk to mine. I got anxious so I tried to please everyone by praising their characters in introduction posts or asking for our interactions of our own chars. Some didnt reply my message. In the last 5 days, I got sleepy entire day, lost an appetite, I only ate a small meal or snack once in a day and insomnia. I felt left out. So I brought my account to follow their public account with feeling that If I befriend with them maybe theyll be interact with me ? Some of them turned out fine. But theres one who seemed to hate me because stupid me had bad choice of words when complimented their char. At first, they didnt know Im the owner of that char, they seemed happy enough but once they knew the truth, they seemed off and didnt talk to me since. I know its stupid to give a damn about mimicking world where those members came from wherever in the world. But its so stressing when you feel like talking to a brick and everyone treats you like an air. Please say something, I really need support",
    "Is there anything that could help with the numbness part of depression ? Depression manifests as a variety of symptoms such as fatigue, insomnia, loss of energy, anxiety ,negative thinking, emotional numbness, loss of motivation...etc So far I found many ways to manage the symptoms of depression but I didnt find anything that helped with the numbness part where you just dont feel anything or care about anything at all nothing makes you happy, sad, cry, your mood is just flat all the time I wasnt always like this I was a normal person with hobbies, ambitions and goals but I developed this condition this year and it stripped me of everything.

    "Will the fatigue from Citalopram go away? I have been on Citalopram for five weeks. The first three weeks I was on 10mg, the last two weeks Ive been on 20mg. On 10mg, I felt tired in the morning, but it got better throughout the day. This lasted for the first week, then I stopped experiencing fatigue. Since switching to 20mg, Ive been feeling even worse fatigue that barely gets better throughout the day. When can I expect this fatigue to start improving? Has anyone had luck switching to taking Citalopram in the evening? Im currently taking it in the morning... Spring break is coming up in a week. Would it be worth it to wait it out and see if the fatigue goes away, or should I use that time to start a different AD? Ive heard that Citalopram can be a sedating AD.

    "Feeling Lost and Weak Hi there, um, I dont really know how else to start this, so Im just gonna go, okay? okay. Ive struggled with severe anxiety and depression for basically my whole life. Or maybe not my whole life, its hard to remember, but definitely after my mother died. Car accident. Nasty business. I was 12, I saw it happen. I think Ive been broken ever since then. It got worse and worse and worse over the course of a decade. I went from honors student, gifted, to dropping out of college. My brain felt like it was clogged up with glue. But I told myself it was all my own fault, that I was just lazy, selfish, immature. Making excuses. Ive seen some doctors, therapists too, most of them were incredibly unhelpful. The stress of dealing with the medical system outweighed any help I got from them. Any medications they tried to make me feel better were duds at best. I went through a really, REALLY bad period about 34 years ago. I lost my entire group of friends, and let myself be abused by my partner for far longer than I should. I turned to selfharm, it was the lowest point Id been in my life. I still see the scars when I look in the mirror. But then I started to get better! I got new friends, got a job, allowed myself to be proud for once. I stopped self harming, swore never to again. Even after getting sexually harassed by my thankfully ex boss, even after losing my grandfather to cancer, I kept it together...for about a year and a half. Almost exactly one year ago I got hit by a car as I was crossing the street. Physically I was mostly unharmed, but it brought back all those memories from the accident where I lost my mother. I started becoming irritable, lethargic, occasionally manic, and the panic attacks...at one point I was having full panic attacks ever single day. I knew I needed help, but I felt powerless to get it. I had to leave my old clinic because the stopped taking my insurance.",

    "My breakup is killing me That was a week ago, the same day she broke up with me in fact, its kind of the reason why we got into the fight responsible for our breakup. After that, I trained every day, thinking itd help me lose weight. But in fact, while I lost 1.5kg within a week, almost half of that was apparently muscle mass. I found out about that yesterday. Now I dont even want to train anymore. In the last few weeks, I found myself repeatedly contemplating passive suicide, as in, it wouldnt be so bad if I drove recklessly and that killed me some day, wouldnt it? Now, I feel like I actually want to die. She had issues, and sometimes those issues really annoyed the hell out of me. But who doesnt have those? I feel stupid for losing her and I feel like I wont ever be able to forgive myself. I was ready to marry this girl, but I lost her, due to my own stupidity. I wont ever find another woman like her again, I know that for certain, and I hate myself for it. I would do anything to get back with her, but she has made it clear that shes not interested in me anymore. Now I know that she will go on tons of tinder dates, kiss other guys, have sex with other guys, maybe in our shared bed and its killing me inside. Is it jealousy? Purely hormonal? I hope it is because if this feeling goes on, I think Im actually going to try something. Im not in therapy, I know I should be, but my depression is making it hard to actually get a therapist.

Yesterday while i was helping my father he yelled at me in the most agreesive type, and got me informed that i need to be obedient, because i am not a 50 y like him. While i was driving, and he was constantly telling me i am a loser. And he always tells me that because i have no job, cause the pandemic, i have to do whatever they want because i cannot afford to pay. He told me that this is how he loves me while being aggressive. I was so terrified and scared because we could cause an accident. While he does not have a driving license, he sais driving is simple and is for stupid ppl. And he treats me like i am a cab driver, telling me where to go... I asked him while driving and trying to focus on the road, why does he treat me like this. Always when i ask questions, no one answers. He constantly commands and yells at everyone in the house, and he always tries to proof that he knows shit.... I was terrified because he could smack me while i was driving. I went in a shock, while i was home, i cried so much, my self esteem is down. And something in me died yesterday. I am a good person and stayed out of trouble, worked. But even when i paid things in the house, or if i helped them constanlty, didnt matter je would treat me the same. Nothing satisfies him. All my life yelled and threatened me in various scenarios like school things, even if he didnt stayed with me and never involving in my after school homework, to pressuring me about exams and threaten me of i dont pass, i will end up being garbage man. He is so mediocre, no involvement but he is the bigger stupid mouth, no communication, no empathy. I am a small meaninglessness human being in his eyes. Why is he fucking mean. I feel pain.

    "My depressed partner drains me So here is the thing. I know hes depressed and I know that he is busy with surviving day to day. But Im pissed. I sometimes get so angry and frustrated with him. He doesnt go to therapy and I dont know, if he really tried to get a therapist but the waiting lists are too long or if he didnt try hard enough. He wont tell me. Same thing with his job situation. I dont know, if he is searching and for what. Everytime I ask him, what he wants to be or do he tells me, he doesnt know. And I started asking him really deconstructed questions like what kind of activities writing textsorganizing eventsmaking statistic sheetsetc do you like? do you want to work alone or in a team? what goals helping people and what kind of peopleincomeetc do you want to be met? and so on. Its always I dont know. I am getting really impatient. Its been six years and he has so much potential that he doesnt see or use. Everytime I suggest something, he doesnt use that info, but feels stupid, becaus he didnt have the idea himself. Doesnt matter that I keep reassuring him that it is okay, to need help or not know everything on the spot. He feels stupid and blocks any further conversation and than i find myself trying to calm him down and in the end he promises me to change things, but never does. Probably because he really doesnt have the energy, I get that on an intellectual level. I understand it. I still feel extremely frustrated. This whole situation keeps our life on hold. It didnt matter to me for a long time. I always told myself, that he will find his way and that he will figure everything out, but now we are in our thirties and I really want to start a family. I want to get married and have children and start the next chapter. I cant do that with a man who barely survives. And it starts to severely affect me.",
    "I can’t go more than 5 minutes without crying These last few weeks have been the hardest in my life. After covid cleared out college campuses and my partner and I were forced to go back home my boyfriends family told him since he was back living under their roof he would have to follow every one of their demands. In the town where we go to college we were seeing each other multiple times a week. And the week before we were booted we spent every hour together. As soon as we got home his family told him he could no longer see me. I understand we are in a pandemic but we had been swapping spit even that same day they told him to quarantine. If he had anything I definitely had it and vice versa. I agreed to two weeks not seeing each other, not knowing how hard it would be. Even after that ended they didnt want us to see each other because during that time my state issued a stay at home order. I have not been able to see friends obviously and my family is abusive and toxic there isnt a single day in the house that there arent screaming matches. I lost my motivation to do any of my classes that went online. I stopped eating, I started drinking, and taking pills in incrementing amounts hoping I would gather the courage to kill myself. I started cutting myself so I could distract myself from the emotional pain. All I do is lie in bed, and get water once a day. I cry so often starting as soon as I wake up, and even more so at night. I havent been able to sleep well, sometimes at all. I only fear this situation is going to get worse and it feels like there will be no end. It was a shock to come from months of being with my person so happy to have it all stripped away so suddenly. If anyone has any tips that would help me, Id appreciate it.",

I have no one to help me either because my parents get mad at me for showing and signs of distress.

My mom will start screaming at me about how me being depressed makes her stressed out and how I dont even try to make friends but I do.

And its not like Im a bad son, Im actually better than most teenagers because I have straight As and because I have no supportive friend group that would invite me to things I dont drink or do drugs or have sex.

    "Gf won't get help because she doesn't want to change Im at a complete loss here. I 27f suffer from depression and anxiety myself. Im having trouble reaching out for help, but Im slowly building the courage and doing self help because I want to get better and be a happy person. Last night my girlfriend 28f who has been struggling for a while told me that shes in a really dark place. When I started to lead the discussion into getting help or even just a little self help, she just gave me a flat out no. Shes been suffering for years and the various meds and therapy she goes through just help her for a little while and then she goes back to depression. She says she doesnt want to be different. She doesnt want to work on being happy because then she isnt herself. Doesnt like the feel of being on meds because she isnt herself. Shes fine just accepting being depressed as her default state and one day when shes tired of living shell end it all. She doesnt want to end it now so shes not eligible to be hospitalised. But she is calm and completely certain that eventually she will kill herself. I dont know what to do with such clear and calm certainty. She struggles with similar things that I do. I try to give the answers that hope are true. whats the point of living when all we do is work and sleep to pay for a place we never use because were working or sleeping Im not worth saving nobody cares etc, but she just refutes it and stays where she is. Problem is, I leave the country in the next 6 months so weve always known our relationship has an expiry date and she has no support network. She has no family and very few friends that are in a position to help out. Shes spent quite a lot of time homeless in the past. I dont know what to do. It feels like she only wants to get better if it happens organically, but that is a rarity. TLDR gf wont get help.",

    "Therapist Reached Out I see a trauma therapist for PTSDCPTSD, and recently I encountered two other traumas which have put me over the edge at times. They know that I havent been doing the greatest while trying to deal with them and that Im continuing to spiral downwards. I usually send a weekly message to my therapist to let them in on the skills Im using and how my week has been. I havent been up for sending messages lately, and I probably scared the crap out of my T last session as I discussed how much I hated having the intense suicidal ideation and how detailed its becoming. I even blew up in their face telling them that they didnt understand how serious I was. I could even hear her start to choke up as rarely do I talk to her in this manner. Today, she sent out a message to let me know how she could help me throughout the week. Im very confused as I have no idea how a therapist can help anyone through the week. I truly appreciate the message of concern, but how can I ask my T for help during the week without it crossing boundaries? I know for sure shes not going to bring me food or allow me to call her, so what does help look like as I know I could use some?",
    "My life is amazing, but I'm a miserable asshole. I'm not sure what to do. When they announced the results a few days later, I didnt feel pride, or accomplishment. I just felt imposter syndrome I didnt deserve it, they must have made a mistake, they made it for political reasons and not based on my skill, etc. My current therapist says it has something to do with not being taught how to appreciate things  how to connect with that feeling of appreciation. Essentially, a deep feeling of notbeinggoodenough means I dont let myself feel the emotional rewards of anything until I feel Ive earned it, which thanks to the feeling, never happens. Shes probably on to something, but no matter the situation, I cant seem to make those connections, even if I can act on them. Maybe its a support thing. I have friends, but I dont ever talk to any of them. I dont have anyone that I tell news to when things happen  Ive tried, but all my friends always seem weirded out by my sharing. When I do talk to my friends, its brief conversations about shared interests, so always surface level stuff. My wife is incredible, but were so completely different. We have almost no common interests, have basically opposite personalities, and even our ways of talking are so different that we constantly misunderstand each other, so giving each other the support we need is difficult and foreign. I honestly cant explain why we have the bond that we do, but it is genuine, and despite the differences the marriage is strong, and despite not being able to feel it, we know we love each other and are loved ourselves. My social skills are, without hyperbole, autistic. I myself am not autistic, but conversations are impossible for me. I never know what to say, unless prompted. Someone says How are you? and I say Good, you? and they respond. If they dont say anything else, I dont know how to continue the conversation. I sit in awkward silence. Ive asked someone how they are three times in a row before. I know Im supposed to say something, but I cannot for the life of me figure out what it is.",
    "Is This Wrong, or is My Mind Sabotaging Me? My depression really didnt manifest significantly until fourish years ago, when I was on my way out of high school.

Im in a degree right now that I thought would be good but now it doesnt feel right anymore.

    "I could use some help figuring out if there‘s a possibility I‘m suffering from depression The thing that makes all this so hard to decipher for me is that Im never certain how I feel. I know it sounds stupid but its the best I can describe it. I have some good days where I just hang out with friends in discord and play minecraft all day but theres always that thought in the back of my mind that I dont deserve this. In contrast to that I also have bad days where I feel like Im on the edge of breaking down and giving up on everything. One of the most common feelings I have is hate towards myself. Now the part that every aRe yOU dePResSed? taKE THiS qUiz! website asks Have I thought of suicide? More or less. Ill be as honest as possible in this part. I have thought about if I would survive the distance from the window to the ground outside. I have thought about if it would hurt very much to stab myself. I was never actually anywhere close to doing it. I have also thought about if Im important to my friends or if theyre just with me out of pity. I have thought about if the world would be any different without me in it. So, I have some suspicions that I COULD be depressed. But I also think its possible that im just imagining things because Im just awful. If anyone made it through this, thank you for your time. If anyone wants to spend their time giving me advice i would be grateful. M",
    "Prozac worries I got prescribed 10 mg of Prozac today and I was doing some research about Serotonin Syndrome httpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiSerotonin_syndromehttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiSerotonin_syndrome. Basically its a very severe condition that can occur when people mix SSRIs like Prozac and other serotonergic drugs. This left me with a couple of questions. ampx200B Dextromorphethan is one of the drugs that can interact with SSRIs to cause the syndrome. I recently had a bad cough and took a lot of it. Also, I dropped acid in the last 3 months, which also can cause the syndrome when mixed with SSRIs. Am I at risk?

    "Could a vitamin D deficiency be causing depression entirely? Ive been severely depressed and suicidal for well over a year at this point, but Ive noticed that it started easing a bit around MarchApril the start of winter in my country and then worsening again in AugustSeptember the start of summer, while I was actually happy in June and July, and any moments of suicidal ideation were anxiety driven, not depression. In winter, because its cold, I spend most of the day lazing in the sun yes, I know skin cancer, but I dont care, so about 45 hours of consistent sunlight at least. In summer, I stay out of the sun entirely because its too hot and I absolutely hate the heat. So this makes me think that something is particularly bad in summer to make me significantly more depressed than winter. Perhaps thats a vitamin D deficiency.

    "Can missing morning erections be caused by depression? I understand that depression can lead to loss of libido and erectile dysfunction. But nowhere I find information whether missing nocturnal  morning erections can be caused by depression as well. And Im not talking about a missing erection once in a while, but total lack of it every day for months. In my limited understanding, morning erections are a pretty much biological thing, which cant be influenced by bad mood or thoughts, so I would assume a depression couldnt impact the presence of these erections. I know about the side effects of antidepressants, but here I am just trying to find out whether regular, untreated depression can cause this lack of nocturnal  morning erections. I feel like I sleep well enough, so missing REM phases is probably unlikely. Any input will be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",

Striking a lighter to light my joint. everything small you can imagine. This makes me mad and too conscious.

We live with parents in India till death. I used to steal erasers, scales etc. from school. Even from my parents too. I have been caught sometimes.

Its not like I can spend time with somebody who lives in another state, its just a penpal type of deal. Anyway, if youre still reading at this point and it wasnt TLDR sorry if I rambled, Im a TERRIBLE rambler  thats my story.... Please help!",
    "How do I tell my SO that I'm depressed, numb and think about suicide daily? Hello redditors! Throwaway Account Ive been depressed for several years now and because I have a hard time feeling any emotions at all I just pretend to and play along for the majority. I am not actively suicidal anymore but I still think about it daily and I cannot shake the automatic ... guess I can always kill myself. Only my best friend who is in a similar state of mind knows how I feel and the rest of my friends and family have no idea and I dont want to tell them for several reasons. I live with my SO and we have been living together for 2 years now. I think she knows that I am feeling blue a lot but I am certain she doesnt know how severe it is. Recently I have been thinking about how I could start a conversation if I chose to do so but I dont know how because she is emotionally unstable sometimes but not clinically depressed and only short periods of time. I am afraid that confiding in people will only make my living situation worse without actually helping my state of mind. I dont know what responses this may get but thanks anyways. I know this sounds like a douche thing to say and I appreciate the good intentions but please spare me the hang in there",
    "Things just keep getting worse Sorry this is so long. One thing after another just keeps happening to me.. Things have been really bad for several years. I lost a really great job and I havent been able to find another. Everyone says Im over qualified and wont stick around, or that Im great but they went with another candidate. Im facing eviction for the 3rd time in 3 years. Ive applied for aid with my county and state, but even though I started in May I havent gotten any help. Ive somehow managed to keep the electricity on until now. I previously owed the power company money and they spread the debt out over months. But this month I couldnt make my payment, so the payment arrangement was canceled and they said my electricity would be disconnected. I dont live in a state where they wont cut off your electricity in the winter, and there is no way I can come up with almost 800. I expect them to disconnect my service Monday morning. Im freaking out and cant sleep because Im afraid when I wake up the power will be off. I interviewed twice for an absolutely amazing job, and about 2 12 weeks ago they offered me they job. I got so excited because I thought things would finally start getting better. They said the offer was dependent upon passing a background check. Originally I was supposed to start Nov. 8. Background check took almost 2 weeks, then they said it was done and were talking about shipping me a laptop job is remote for out of state company. Then Friday they told me the background check had brought up some things that required additional information from me. I got a copy of the report and it shows 2 misdemeanor charges from 2019. I was pulled over and ticketed for not having insurance or current car tags cause I didnt have  for either. And I bounced a check that I wasnt able to cover. I was fined for both, but I havent had the money to make any payments on either. I was hoping this great job would let me take care of those. On the background check it says I was sentenced to jail  I wasnt, but might even been for failure to pay the fines.",
    "accountability buddies i need an accountability buddy on discord. i have been depressed fr as long as i can remember but later i cant do anything, i had periods like this in the past but now i am starting to get used to it and i hate it. we can make a server on discord, just for us two, a vent channel so we can dumb our thoughts somewhere, a to do list for each day, and encourage each other. Im sorry i am not sure how this works exactly but if you have any other suggestions you can add them. i would need someone extremely open minded though because i have been through a lot of unexpected stuff. of course i will try to help too. please reach out if you are interested in us helping each other. just keep in mind that i am looking for a friend not a partner so your sexuality should not matter thought i know straight men or lesbians feel more comfortable talking to girls in general and that is okay. i dont care about your race or gender or anything but i am kind of beat down of talking to so many strangers on reddit without actually building a meaningful connection with anyone so please leave sort of intro in the comments. thank you for taking the time to read this, even though i might be a bit awkward.",
    "So… is this it? For like ever? Ive had depression on and off for about 10 years now, and I just finally moved out on my own, got a job Im good at but is not what I ever studied or dreamed of doing, and I just feel empty. Like Id rather be laying in bed today than be at work. So is this gonna be the rest of my life? Im on antidepressants but I dunno. Just doesnt seem like things matter. I dont really wanna be in a 95 from January to December for the rest of forever. And I mean I enjoy video games and movies still but its just killing time I feel like. Is there anything I can do?",
    "I’m crying at work; should I ask to clock out? Content warning self harm and depressive feelings. Im not diagnosed with depression or anxiety, but I feel it often. I have intrusive thoughts and I just dont want to do anything. Im at work right now and I cant focus on work and just keep crying. I cut myself last night for the first time in 8 years and I feel horrible. I want to crawl into my bed and just let my job go to shit and just get fired but I need this job. Its a good job and I like it. I just cant handle today. What do u do?",
    "I don't know what to do at this point other than end it. Nothing has helped so far. I have CPTSD. I have nightmares, flashbacks, panic attacks, episodes of dissociation. I throw up or have an episode when people touch me in the wrong places, especially my stomach. The only reason I havent killed myself is because I have a beloved ferret named Slinky, and he wouldnt understand where I went if I died. He needs me. I dont want to live like this anymore, but I dont want to die. No treatment I have gone through has ever worked for me. I have been on 3 different SSRIs so far Prozac, Zoloft, Lexapro and none of them have put a dent in my mood. I have also been on Lamictal, a mood stabilizer. It didnt do anything, and they kept upping the dosage. I had to taper off of it because it was too much for my body to handle, and I would throw it up. I have been kicked out of several facilities for not responding to treatment in any way. Fortunately, I make a little bit of money. I sell art and I work at my grandfathers gas station down the road. TLDR Mom abused and neglected me to the point of not knowing how to function as a person, I have been sexually abused 3 times which resulted in an eating disorder, I am so mentally ill that I am in agony every day. I have untreated BPD, ADHD, CPTSD and possibly autism. I have severe anxiety and depression that no treatment can put a dent in. I have been kicked out of several facilities for being completely unresponsive to treatment. I am transgender FTM, preeverything, in an unsafe environment, and drowning in dysphoria. I live with so much misdirected guilt from everything that the only things I think about are hurting or killing myself. And I have to go to college this year. What the fuck do I do?",
    "I don’t think it’s that bad I dont know if this is the best place to post this, but I do need help. Im sorry that its so long. Im also sorry for the bad English, it isnt my native language. Some background info I dont think Im super depressed, but my friends are convinced that I am. I made a plan to kill myself, but havent followed through yet. I have previously promised to tell my friends if I made new plans to kill myself, which I did. Now, they want me to get hospitalised so that I can get help, but the psych ward hasnt helped me before. The stuff I need help with I promised to get help yesterday, but I no longer believe I need much help. They wont let me rescind my promise, and I desperately dont want to break it. I am fairly certain Im not depressed. Even though Ive attempted suicide a couple of times, I have ended the attempts on my own before getting hurt. My question is should I listen to them and go to the psych ward, or am I justified in believing I can manage on my own? Thanks in advance.",
    "Trying to help my bf with his depression after failed attempts. Im an enlisted soilder. My boyfriend is a vet. He has not held a job for more than a few weeks. Ive applied for jobs for him, gotten him 2 jobs, paid for his motorcycle repair, notarized his divorce paperwork etc. The list goes on and on. Weve been together for a 1.5 years. Lived together for 1. He doesnt tell me he loves me anymore, doesnt call me anything other than hey or my first name, cant make plans more than a week in advance. His mother, our mutual friend and I have been taking care of him. He doesnt go out with friends or try to go back school. Nor does his physical therapy even though its free. Hes actively not trying to do anything other than exist. Is it okay to just walk away at this point? As a soilder, Im conflicted and feel like I cant leave a fallen soldier. As gf Im exhausted and angry. Any advice? Im not looking for permission to stay in this relationship. I really want to leave but with a clear conscience.",

    "I am 13 looking for help Hello I live at Hong Kong. I always felt stress at school or at home. I am kinda big in video games but my parents never agreed. They believe that school is the only way to success. If I said anything I researched. They would say I am crazy  not really they but mainly my mom I also wanted to improve myself. I have friends at school but I just dont feel happy. I would cry everyday and I never felt joy outside of the internet. I think I might be addicted but I am not really at the same time. At school I never felt joy. And I am the top 5 student of my class. But I never felt any improvement. I am always doing the same thing wrong and tutor never helped me.

My girlfriend is the only thing I have and shes getting tired of my negative vibes. Its exhausting. Im 27 and work at Walmart and feel like utter garbage.

    "I don’t know why I’m seeking help here but please just read as much as you can... So Im 15 and for most of my life Ive been treated not badly but like Im really different as if there were something wrong with me pretty much only in school since kindergarten. Other than that Ive always been a happy kid with a great sense of humour but in the last few years since becoming a teen things have crashed down on me. I believe it was 2015 my close nan my mums side, ill get to why thats important later was diagnosed with dementia other nan lives on a farm outside my town where she barely sees anybody. In 2017 my cat that I had only had for about 5 years when he came to my doorstep seemingly only a few weeksmonths old suddenly died from chest cancer and I felt sad mainly because I didnt have much to do with him even though I loved him so much. Although I have had a few pet losses this hurt me for a few months tear down my face as Im writing this. The main reason it was so bad was how a normal day turned into hearing he was unable to move when my Aunty went home for a break, and that later turned into the vet saying he should be put down. On to the next crack in my life. Only a few weeks before I was born my dad died I still dont have it in me to sit with my mum and have that conversation on how it happened, and although I dont feel sad about not having him as Im used to it since birth, I have heard things about fatherless kids not having as good lives although I am being co raised by my Aunty who is pretty much a 2nd mother except she can be giving the fatherly tough love some times. There has also been drama including my other Aunty doing drugs and making our life harder I will say I dont think it is intentional but her stupid choices are messing us all up. Theres heaps more I can talk about like my addiction to games even when Im not enjoying them and the recent passing of artist xxxtentacion I know hes a very controversial person but I really enjoyed his music and just seeing his face and hearing his messages to his fans.",

The best friend I ever had left me almost 2 months ago. Everyone just leaves, rejects, and makes fun of me. I dont get why. Theres just no point in me living.",
    "Am I too demanding? How to deal with cultural differences I am a master student that study abroad. I had miscalculation on financial stuff and everyone in my new country is very individualistic. So they told me to find my own way and I got unlucky met some horrible people and I got PTSD for awful events. Every time I asked people at the university or government what should I do to fix my problem. They told me to find a friend if I could not figure it out by myself. The problem is most people here dont make a new friend after high school. A new friend wont help me to do stuff. I should get a close friend because I keep getting the answer you can use google or I cannot help you. I dont like to go to a party or bar. I am too depressed to do fun stuff. I am tired with a suggestion about joining student association because I did that and I only met students that only want for FWB. And female students mostly busy with their boyfriend. So I thought I need to find boyfriend too because no one wants to make a new friend. My psychologist told me to find an online friend. However, when I told my problem to people that I met online in my the new country, most people would reply with, You should search people in real life or You seems put lots of chores to your friend or You should stop searching for boyfriend. I know people my new country is famous for being rude and direct. But Im still dont know what should I do. I usually only ask like translation or things like guidance if I have a certain condition. I just need support and was wondering if support is too much to ask for people in the western country?",
    "Being the boyfriend. My Girlfriend and I have been dating for almost 6 years. She has suicidal thoughts occasionally. She tells me I am very supportive and a great bf but sometimes I dont think Im giving the best support. Sorry for the long post. I dont know if theres any other SOs in this thread or if there is another sub I should be posting in I dont have anyone I can talk to about this. After about a year into dating, while we were cleaning dishes in her apartment, she let on how serious her depression was when she told me that she had once held a gun to her head. After a long silence we both cried and I told her how much I loved her. She told me that she had only ever told her best friend and didnt want anyone to know, so Ive never told anyone, not even my closest friend of 15 years whom I share anything and everything with. So thank you to whomever shares any words of wisdom youre all I got. Over the the last year our relationship has dwindled, we still tell each other we love each other constantly and talk about getting engagedmarried. But we dont have conversations like we used to, she always falls asleep on the couch so we dont sleep together hardly, we dont have sex at all, I think 6 times total last year, that has been a big point of frustration at least for me  Ive tried to initiate sex and been shot down so many times that Ive all but given up at this point, even when its your lover, your best friend, it still feels like crap when you get rejected. Ive tried to talk to her about it many times the day after or some time that is away from sex so we can have a calm conversation about it but everyone so far, every time we have talked shes gotten worked up and basically says she doesnt feel like it. We both have HPV so sometimes that gets in the way but whenever weve talked its always that shes not in the mood. I feel like shes not telling me something. I feel as if weve stopped growing and are maybe even starting to resent each other, which is scary to me.",
    "i want it all to end Last year i got done with my senior highschool year and despite working soo hard for since june till the next june, studying hours daily i ended up falling short of the percentage i needed to enter the major i wanted to which is computer science and let myself and my family down. I had to major in finances since it was my only choice and i am hating it. Moreover i am hating the fact that i am living with myself as a failure, i never achieve anygoals that i want and i never get anywhere. I have OCD which i am taking medication and therapy for and it has been kicking in so hard lately with all the negativity making me go crazy. I am always depressed and my family is disappointed from me. I just feel like a burden now on every body around me i always have breakdowns and my family always blasts me for it. All my relatives are engineers and other good majors and jobs and i am stuck in this. i am sorry if my writing isnt organized but i am so disoriented right now. I feel like if i just die i would relief every body around me from my burden and relief them from the shame of having me. I cant stand living with my self knowing that i an a complete and utter failure. I dont deserve anything. I will never get anywhere in life i just want it all to end. i just want to die i cant live with myself anymore. And it is a relief knowing that when i die no one will care as i dont want to hurt anyone. I have no friends, my family wish they didnt have me. My relatives didnt even care to call or visit me when i was hospitalized after a cycling accident. I just wish to die and be forgotten instead of living in misery and burdening my family. I dont want to kill my self because i am a bit religious and suicide is prohibited in my religion but i wish i could. I just want to die i cant live anymore. I hate my self. I hate seeing my self in the mirror every morning. I hatr waking up and knowing i am still alive. i cry my self to sleep every might wishing i never wakeup again but i still do.",
    "No longer actively depressed but now I need help beating the apathy. I think my life has been changed forever by the major depressive episode I had last year. I dont think Ill ever feel quite like that again I hope, but its left me a parting gift. I just dont care about most things anymore. This is positive in some ways  it makes me less of a perfectionist for example good enough is fine and I dont get choked up on the little things as much. However, it is also very very negative in other ways. I will go for several weeks without doing my laundry, wait until the last second to do assignments, wont clean, etc. I have NO sense of urgency or shame, particularly urgency, but still have minor guilt after the fact if someone comments on my slobbishness. Like, if someone was coming over and I had an hour to clean I wouldnt get everything done. Id probably pick up a few things and say Im sorry for the mess and feel guilty afterwards that Im a slob. But it wouldnt make me change, however and that annoys me. I know that I do care that these things are happening, but theres a total disconnect from actually caring enough to do them respectably. For example, I would like to clean my room because I enjoy the look and space of a clean room. I know it makes me feel accomplished when I do. But a bigger part of my brain doesnt mind living in squalor because it is so apathetic to everything. I dont like this about myself. I want to be timely and disciplined but I have a hard time caring and almost 0 motivation though its slowly creeping back in occasionally. I feel this may be a discipline issue but I would also like some sense of motivation or ambition. I get like this with my career goals too. I want to want more for myself, but I dont act on it.",
    "First break up So ive scrolled on here for a bit and it seems like everyone is really nice... so here goes nothing This is my first break up but very weird ending. Ended with us both crying and and saying we loved eachother but the timing just wasnt right. He kept thinking about a toxic ex that he just couldnt get over even if in every way our relationship was healthier.his depression is a bit more severe than mine, but i would feed off his too0 much as well witch was bad too. I honestly dont know what im doing here....i guess i just want my story hear even though its rather insignificant and dumb haha. But i feel different now this is a different kinda of depression, i feel more just empty rather than hating myself or wanting to hurt myself. I dont really know how to cope with it. Like is this just how you feel after a break up and it passes or like do i just feel empty now...? Yes he was my first in practically everyhing we did over all but i cant help to feel it was all fake... he said he would think abouy her when we were together thats when i knew his depression was bad because he would just stop everything, caring, talking to me, all attention would stop it like would mental fuck me up. Like when he would do that it was a never endint cycle in my head like okay what wrong how do i help or just support,what if its me? Can i be nicer? Can i be sexier? And i ugly yo look at? Is he thinking of her? Etc. And it would every single time come down to him just randomly missing her. Like even right now it still fucks me up when did he think of her? When i was my happiest? Like it just all crumbles in to lies for me. Or im over thinking this whole thing and should stop thinging of it but its hard lol. I dont know maybe im in the wrong post but just advice, help on my depression how to cope with my body image cause i think im gross.i really dont know",
    "I'm so tired I wanted it to stop, I just wanted this awful string of events to end already, yet whenever I got scared or overwhelmed all I was told was to get through it to summer, but I couldnt. I didnt think I could do it, at this point I was being told it would get better soon for months on end but everything got worse. They said thats just life, theres always something to get in your way but you have to do it regardless, but I couldnt cope with that anymore, I couldnt cope with that awful reality. I just didnt enjoy living anymore, and if its this bad now as only a highschooler I couldnt imagine myself being older, in an actual work environment where the same problems persisted. I wanted it to end so badly, nothing was improving and the foreseeable future looked awful and stressful. I promised myself that if it got this bad again Id ask to see a therapist again, it took a couple weeks. Sometime towards the end of next week I learned that I was also taking the SAT another standardized test infamous for not working in the southeast in about ten days, leaving me with not nearly as much time to prepare as I thought. I broke down completely, preparing for the AP exam took enough out of me alone, but two of them back to back was a death sentence for me. I kept crying over the idea that it got worse again, that whenever I thought I was at rock bottom it just kept going downhill, no mtter what I did I would continue to feel awful about living itself. I laid out a ten day study plan to go through, saying that in ten days it would be over and the better times everyone talked about would finally be here, it hurts to say but I dont think thats happening. I remember the next day where during all of class I lied in bed, not saying a word to the friends I usually talk to all day, it just all felt so hopeless.",

    "F 15 struggling with depression and feeling hopeless. I feel like I have no one to talk to. Any advice? Hello Reddit. for a little backstory, Im 15 years old and I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety just over two years ago. It has definitely gotten worse sense then, and I have not talked to a counselor since. Last November, I dropped out of my high school to begin home schooling with a tutor due to social anxiety and my depression hitting a low point. Though I enjoy the environment and freedom that comes with home schooling much better, it does get very lonely. The only people I talk to now are my long distance boyfriend, a couple online friends, and my family who are very busy with their own work and school Along with my family being busy, I hardly ever mention my depression to them. If I do, I feel like Im wasting their time and theyll be disappointed in me. My depression has gotten increasingly worse over the past few months. Ive always been skinny, but Ive lost a significant amount of weight to the point its unhealthy. I have no appetite, no desire to do anything, and no one to talk to. With the start of summer, my day consists of laying around and watching TV or playing video games. Even if plans do come up, physical symptoms of anxiety like panic attacks, head aches, and stomach aches typically prevent me from going. My boyfriend wants me to see a counselor, But Im hesitant because the one I had previously didnt help much, and was very expensive. I worry that by asking my parents for help, with my anxiety, depression, and poor eating habits Ill be wasting their money and time. At the same time, Im afraid that if I continue to sit here and do nothing I wont live to see my 16th birthday. What should I do? Any tips on getting help and finding meaning and motivation in life at a young age?",
    "Does anyone know of a non-lethal poison that causes vomit and/or diarrhea and can be mixed with water? Instead ofbesides hurting myself, I could do some justice in the world. Since good things dont happen to good people, I think I can make bad things happen to bad people. Not intending to cause any permanent injuries, just a little of karma. Might change my mind later, but I want to consider some options. A little of mud butt wont kill anyone, right?",
    "Help. Depressed husband. How to best support and love? Hi! I believe my husband is depressed but not completely admitting to it yet. We have been together 14 years and have children together. I love him dearly. His depression has manifested itself in pushing me away, anger and hostility towards me, I believe as a defense from trauma in his childhood that has been retriggered in the past few years. I am basically his scapegoat for everything wrong in his life. He also is distant, wont talk, and uses TV and books as an escape which are at thankfully healthy but spends considerable time in them. I would love ANY solid advice on how to navigate this. How can I best love him through this? Especially if his instinct right now is to push me away. Any dos or donts? Can I leave affirmations  encouragement for him in the form of notes? This is killing me slowly inside. I miss my friend. He is such a fantastic guy and I feel as if he has been swallowed by a dark cloud. Also to note we are in the beginnings of couples counseling. Thanks again for advice. Especially if you have been that husband and come out healed on the other side.",
    "I haven’t been happy in so long I look up how to get out of bed all the time. I see sit up as the first step but when I wake up in the mornings I dont want to feel better. I just want to go back to sleep. I sleep all day. I dont have a job and I know my boyfriend is being affected. I feel like a parasite on everyones life. No one benefits from being my friend or being with me. Im literally just a burden. Some of my best friends have even blocked me on social media and honestly Im not even mad. I understand. I take my anti depressants, Ive been to inpatient hospitals. I literally have no motivation to keep going. I dont want to die but I dont want to wake up anymore. I just want to lay in bed. I have a son. Even though I have no job, he goes to a babysitter. I only watch him twice a week. I love him and I miss him when hes gone but I can barely even take care of him when hes home. I know hes going to grow up to resent me. I wish I was the same person that gave birth to him but I am completely different. Hes such a good kid. Hes so happy I wish I could be a good mom for him. I wish I could be who my family needs me to be. I hate myself. I am terrible for my family. Most of the time I think that staying around is going to be worse for my family than if I just left. I dont know what to do. I want to be happy but Ive tried so many times to heal and the attempts have never gained any happiness.",
    "I fucking hate bipolar In mania got violent with a parent. was taken to juvy. Was released because the petition wasnt filed. In my state they cant hold you for 24 hours with no petition. Was released still riding the high wave of high energy excited to go home. Was taken to my empty grandparents house. Then to my uncles.

A good thing to mention right now is that my stress and other things I couldnt sleep, loss of my appetite, etc... had also stemmed from my home life, but that goes into a whole nother story. On Friday I found out something, that he had already gotten a new girlfriend we broke up on Monday btw with a girl who had a crush on him through, and before, we went out. I know it was stupid of me but I was upset, I was glad for him but I couldnt help feeling...betrayed?? ?very stupid of me I know In short he then told people why i broke up with him, and that is when i started to ignore him as it was private. I keep having these breakdowns and I feel that this story is when it really started to affect me, at this moment I have had 3 breakdowns in lessons and 1 at break, along with many at home. I just want to know if Im being stupid or if I actually have a problem, sorry about my bad writing skills, Im writing this as Im in a breakdown If you would like I will get into my home story, it is a big part of this story Thank you in advance",

Ive been asking my mother to get me help for months at this point, and yesterday i just broke down crying and begging her to get me some help because my depression was getting super bad. Before anyone asks, Im still underage and cant get any help on my own. Ive been harming before and recently started again, and months ago my mother did find out about the scars and even then it wasnt enough for her to get me the right help. Now I know that the virus slowed down everything for everyone, but when i was asking for a psychiatrist they were already working ppst quarantine and my mother easily booked me an appointment but she was stretching it out for absolutely no reason.

I can feel the physical pain in my chest, or heart, specifically. Its so heavy. Ive been seeing a psychotherapist for a few months already, but it doesnt seem to help. It started because of work which I already resigned from 2 months ago. And then this pandoras box collection of traumatic events in my subconscious seem to have been opened so Ive been still experiencing the breakdowns despite seeing a psychologist.

    "I could really do with some kind words. So I just got off the phone with my GP. Shes prescribing me Prozac. Ive never been on psych meds before. Im 17 and have struggled with increasingly worse severe depression since I was 11. Im undiagnosed as of now because Im only this last 2 months seeking help for the first time kind of a doordie situation. Im from the UK and NHS mental health services are dire. My GP essentially told me that due to being 17 and a half years old, Im too young for adult mental health services and too old to be referred to the adolescent services. She listened to me talk and on the spot said that I sound like I have PTSD I honestly feel like I do as well, but Im not prepared to say I have it wo formal diagnosis which I feel was way too quickly to say something like that. Basically the next half year ill be monitored to make sure the Prozac doesnt finish me off, because in people of my age it can make suicidal feelings get worse. I feel so lost. She said I cant see a psychiatrist or a clinic or anything until Im 18, which is 7 months away, so Im just put on meds and stuck waiting. I feel such lack of support or urgency... I literally want to die and theyre just like heres some pills, come back when youre 18. I dont know, maybe Im complaining too much. I just felt like they were worryingly quick to give me meds and tick me off the list. Im super overwhelmed right now, there wasnt even any talk of side affects or really what to expect, apart from by the way, these pills make you even more suicidal sometimes.",

    "We were engaged. He left me for a 19 year old he has been talking to online for the past 3 months They only saw each other in person once at the time, had each other added on Snapchat ever since, but never talked. When the Tokyo Olympics finally started, she posted a story on Snapchat about Brazil losing in a game of volleyball or something, thats what he told me at least. Since him and I always watched the games together when we could, he knew about it and replied to her story making a joke. Theyve been talking ever since. He told her about me and our story, that we were engaged, etc, and she thought it was awesome and asked to follow me on Instagram. I accepted it. She was extremely nice to me in the beginning and also replied extremely fast. After a few days talking on there she asked me for my WhatsApp number. Ill confess that I didnt really want to give her because I barely knew her and I dont like giving my number to random people. But I didnt want to be rude so I ended up giving her my number and we started talking there. After just a little while talking on WhatsApp, she asked me if we wanted to do a video call with her us 3. I thought she was moving way too fast with intimacy with us, but I asked my fiancé if he wanted to and he said it was up to me. I ended up accepting it. It was actually nice and we called once or twice more. Well, so this situation of her being friends with us lasted for about a month, but around the beginning of October I started being suspicious about some things with the two. We used to call every night before I slept Im at GMT3 and hes at GMT5, and he started giving excuses to go to sleep earlier because he was feeling sick, tired, etc, and I believed him. Well, all those times he was ending our call earlier to call her for 3 hours straight. They also called at other times during the day that I never knew about.",

I immediately went and bought some mens deodorant since it tends to be stronger, but I was hoping someone might have a better way for me to combat this.

    "Some guys on reddit may have location info for \"nudes\" I posted and I am so close to ending it Long story short, I had anorexia and needed some body positivity. So, I uploaded images to flickr, turned off share exif data feature, and posted a before and after pic of my body, which ended up being a lot of chubby pics of me completely clothed but bikini. I was horrified to find out some scary captions were appearing and I could see it was being fetishized, which was not my intent really, I just wanted to feel better about myself because Ive felt like shit lately. 240 people viewed it and it was reposted to a sub for fat girls by another account, which was my mistake for putting the link on reddit where it could be crossposted in the first place. My exif data contained my location and phone, but Im not sure what else... Im terrified that they have my location data or serial number not sure if possible. I contacted Flickr and they CONFIRMED there was a glitch that showed my exif data. However, even so, seeing as I live in a college dorm, is there really any cause for worry if they have my phone model and location, if this is 5K miles from my real house, and the photo was not entirely sexual? Im deeply horrified and have had a panic attack all day. There were maybe 20 photos of me. You couldnt see my face or head or anything other than bust. How much should I be worrying about this?

Sometimes I love her, i want to marry her, life together, etc. Other times I imagine myself being happier with someone else. Maybe someone more attractive or with more things in common note my gf already quite attractive and we share interests, not necessarily perfectly my type but nobody is. But Ive had this with other things. Im incapable of Happiness unless I am EXTREMELY distracted, or drunk. or both. when im not distracted, i think about everything. maybe ill never be happy. maybe ill never be skilled enough in my interests and hobbies to satisfy me.

There is something wrong with the way I think. i think? but idk what to do.

    "I don’t know what’s going on I was always the guy that never thought he would get depression you know. Honestly me even saying that I have depression makes me feel like less of a man, it makes me feel like one of those emo and edgy kids from school pretending to be depressed and in their feelings. Everytime I felt sadness or lonely I just take a break and go to sleep or just get back on the grind and try to push through it. But I dont know, lately its gotten so much worse. Two weeks ago for a whole week straight I had insomnia, and Ive been feeling lost, unmotivated, frustrated, anxious with everything. My life is falling apart because Ive been being unmotivated to do anything. And back then If I ever felt unmotivated I always thought that it was just a lack of discipline to do the things I dream and strive for. But lately its been different. Ive been in my feelings every night, and I sleep for more than 10 Hours daily. Im always tired, I feel lethargic, unmotivated, and I need help. I looked up what the things Ive been feeling could mean, and the Internet keeps suggesting I have depression. But I dont feel overwhelmingly sad, I just feel overwhelmed, stressed out all the time, my body doesnt just want to do anything. My Mind just wants to take a day off. I just wanna give up on life. No I dont want to die, but I cant bring myself to try anything anymore. I want to make D1 Soccer in college, but I just dont feel like it anymore to practice and train and so I deteriorate in skill and fitness. I guess this is Karma because someone told me a while back they were feeling the things Im feeling now and I just told them to step up and be a man, and kind of just disregarded the Possibility of them actually being depressed. Even then, I used to have a friend who was depressed and I told her to just stop being depressed and own up to her actions and feelings, I told her it was just a lack of strength and that she just lacked discipline. But I guess now I understand. And I hate it.",

I know that Ive caused my own isolation, my depression wants me to push people away so badly, and when I see people not making an effort on their side, people who I felt they would, its just tearing me apart. I really, really just want to disappear. I feel horrible for wanting people to feel guilty, but Im so exhausted of feeling this way and I only want to be bitter and angry at the world.",

It started on my birthday of all days... she suddenly got really paranoid and yelled at me that I had poisoned her food... She keeps contacting me through various means and screaming at me that Im a horrible person and that she needs to beat me up forever and that I actually have no feelings and somehow my whole life is a lie. She keeps spreading rumors about me to her friends and online. She beat me up until I started hallucinating really badly and then told the police I was a stalker who she had never met. I cant find anyone to help me. Shes sometimes lucid, but usually, the things she says arent even coherent... I have no idea what happened... Im so sad and hurt...",

    "Im 14 and i already managed to fail my life hi guys, this is my first post on Reddit. I am only 14 years old. Ive been suffering from depression ever since i was 12. I rarely feel happy anymore. Unfortunately these intense feelings have lead me onto a path of constant drug use which only makes my depression worse because I know i am smarter than that. I started smoking weed 2 years ago and obviously things have only gone downhill from then. I am literally mentally and physically addicted to a fucking USB Juul and Ive even found myself robbing weed dealers just because I thought that would make me feel sick but it only made things worse. I have been taking escitalopram since I was 11. Ever since I wet to high school I did a lot of stupid shit and now that I look back at it i purely did those things because of peer approval. These couple of years have literally felt like a lagging game. I havent smoked in a day and I feel like complete shit. Theres probably a lot of things I left out because when i dont smoke for extended periods I feel dumb and slow. I made a Reddit account just to post this so please dont come at me with some bullshit jokes. I feel like ending my life my family is fighting as im writing this. Even typing a paragraph as simple as this feels mentally challenging. In elementary school my teachers would constantly say how smart i was and I would get 80s and 90s without studying and now I feel like because of the effect weed had on my brain I wont be able to find a career later on in life. PLEASE SOMEONE GIVE ME SOME ADVICE",

Im not sure how to phrase my question or even what exactly Im looking for... I guess I just want to hear some other thoughts on this. Does anyone of you ever left a partner due to your depression?

My repressed anger, my failed, awkward attempt at love, my feelings of hopelessness, but like I said, theres so much I cant even keep track of it,like my mind is reminding me of all those thoughts one by one.

    "I think I need help.(Long)(references self harm) Im not one to usually ask for help, im a high schooler now and for most of my life Ive been a suffer in silence person. However, a couple years ago, towards the end of 7th grade, I sort of began to withdraw myself from friends and family, and I basically started writing a journal in which I very heavily contemplated self harmsuicide. My parents found this and set me up with a counselor, who thinks I have majorclinical depression. She recommended I go to the doctor for very mild antidepressants, because she thought those could help. My doctor, though, didnt prescribe them. It feels like no one takes it seriously when I do talk about this? I did begin smoking weed in about 8th grade to help cope, but have began smoking a lot less once I did meet counseling. I should note that it did feel better over the summer between 7th and 8th grade, but hit full swing in 8th. Im in 9th now still feelin it, but my friends just sort of brush it off when I mention the possibility of self harmsadness. Im not really sure what to do with myself to be honest because no one seems to care, school counselors just told me to join clubs and no one really tries to help. People say I hope it gets better, dude! But it always seems fake. Could I get some advice please? ?",

Ive come to terms with it and am fine with it since im in the adult world now and have more to focus on, however I cant help feel depressed as im going to be finished college within a year, going to be buying a 2 part house with my parents eventually and actually start my career and adult life but I cant ever seem to get girls to even look at me and its honestly depressing. Ontop of that even if girls were interested in me I wouldnt know how to read any signs or know a good way to ask them out  the closest I came was last year with a girl in one of my classes but I heard her talk about her boyfriend and that kinda put a stop to any thoughts about dating her around then. Adding to this im always feeling lonely most of the time, as pretty much all my friends in college have girlfriends or have atleast have had a better and more eventful relationship then me. Its getting to the point where im thinking to myself im just not one of those people persons because i generally work better by myself, and will end up growing old and alone except being that kind of person terrifies me because thats now how I want to live my life. Anyway I guess thats my first rant on here, I would appreciate any advice someone can give me to help stop the loneliness or be more of a people person, going to post this in the other sub and see if I can get any help there.",

Every couple of days Ill have moments that can last 30 minutes to an hour or longer where Im not happy, not necessarily sad... just unhappy? even if the main feeling unhappy isnt happening if my friends ask me to go out with them after school I think about going along and then think that I wont have fun and start to dread the idea. This even happens with my girlfriend who I love but if she asks me if i want to come over the next day I will never say a definite answer, instead Ill say maybe or possibly just because I dont know how Ill feel like the next day. I also feel that nothing will bring me joy like video games, i will quickly get bored of them in these moments and try to think of something to do but everything I think of doing doesnt seem as if it would make me any less bored. In the mornings Ill think of the day ahead and absolutely dead it sop much that the night before I prep myself by saying why the next day is going to be good, this sometimes helps a bit but i usually run out of energy. I feel like i have a fair amount of symptoms of a less severe depression but from everything Ive read it seems that an episode lasts around at least a week.

    "I just told my parents that I had depression, it didn't go well at all. No matter from where you are and which century you got born in, problems such as depression doesnt leave the world, everyone can get depression depending on the situation that they are having. My Iraqi parents went through alot when they were in Iraq, they went through tough wars and time where they dont have food or water. They moved out of the country to Dubai, where I got born and raised in. We all know that depression can cause people to suicide, but my parents had another thoughts. I am a mechanical engineering student studying in Malaysia, for the past year, i got soo stressed by the amount of assignment, tests, lab reports, lessons that I have to study, and extra work that i need to do to have a good GPA. Going through al of that made me go insane and depressed, i reached out for help ofc, it helped abit but not that much, so I had to relay on myself, and heal myself. And thankfully, im doing well nowadays. I decided to adopt a cat recently, because first i like cats alot, and second, i read alot of researches that says pets can help people with depression. My dad is an animal guy, so he doesnt mind at all. But my mom has allergy and asthma, so convincing her is pretty hard. Today, I told my mom i had depression, and if adopt a cat it would help me alot to avoid the same senario. Instead of asking why I had depression and what caused it, she decided to say smth rude, which was You getting depression because of school pressure and you wanting a cat is all a girl thing, dont be a girl and man up At that moment I felt that smth pinched my heart and I just wanted to leave the house to somewhere else, she made me feel as if my problem didnt exist and i was faking it just to get a cat, i was soo offended and now im scared that ill get depressed again. I know my parents went through alot, but they should take such situations seriously, no matter where you got born or in which century.",

I started to play video games because as a child I was never allowed any type of electronic and I was extremely curious. Because of how my family treated me I started playing more and more video games and it became the one thing that I actually felt motivated to do.

My parent filmed me on a camera and now all my homework must be done in front of a camera. I am just sick of how everything in my life is falling apart. My parents made a contract for me to sign about the rules of the house. I signed it. There are special things like, finish all homework get 30 mins of screen time. There are also stupid rules like at lunch no tv, only homework. My parents want me to do exercise but I am already 6ft1 and 150 pounds. They scream at me when I want to use my 30 mins of screen time after I have done my homework. On weekends I sleep for 14 hours and I just feel like I am in a constant cycle of screaming and pain.

    "HS ruined my life HS was the start of several problems to my mental health, stress, anxiety, social problems and bad grades with it too as a consequence... Everything started back on the 31st of October of last year when we were having a party in our class because of Halloween, then two bullies entered the classroom, and basically changed my life. There was a bully episode that day, and was the consequence of me changing the section of the class, which means changing classmates and teachers. I made the right choice as I was constantly harrassed by the old classmated and the teachers were bad, like, really bad. So I changed the section, and I thought everything was back to normal. I was wrong. I find it hard to even study now. I cant force myself into doing nothing. Literally nothing. There is nothing I can do even to go to school. Its really fucking hard. I failed my mom. I failed everyone and what I wanted to be. I find myself in the situation where I cry a lot thinking about this. I am a failure. My mom had faith in me. There is still people that love me. My grandparents, my mom, everyone in my family. Except I havent talked about it to any one of them. I think it would be embarrassing because they cant understand what its like to be like this. I expect an answer like youre too young. And they are almost right, except depression can be found at any age. Im having a mental breakdown, seriously. As I said before, I struggle when I want to force myself into doing things, like homework or just study. I just want to end it right now. The only thing that makes me sad about it is what my family will think about. It not gonna be their fault. I even failed them. They were never strict with me, always there to love me.

He then proceeded to ask if I wanted to join him on trip which just took place this Monday through Wednesday. In that moment I got angry. How could you tell me to go on this trip when you just told me you didnt love me? It wasnt logical. We argued and towards the end he said he was done. I asked him to clarify and he needed some space from me. Fine. I let him be until he contact me on Sunday the 10th wanting to meet up the following day. We didnt end up meeting up on Monday and did a follow up instead on Tuesday. We talked. I was worried for him. I told him that people were concerned for his safety and he just laughed it off with the laugh of a maniac. He said that why did people care. He was so distant. Before I left I asked again where we stood. And he told me to give some time. I asked for how long and he told me he would let me know. Fast forward to this Monday. He told me to have any false hope of getting together. We went on our trip and I noticed he was texting a lot while trying to angle himself to hide his phone. It was something I noticed right away. We moved on through the day. We got to our destination. While laying down on my bed he came laid down next to me. It was odd because he didnt want to be close to me previously. We went about our day. Came back to our Airbnb and as I was laying down again he came into my room again and fell asleep next to me. After our naps we went out to explore the town.

Also, Ive managed to reconnect with some old friends from school, which I didnt think would ever happen.

I felt like I couldnt handle his needs, his constant need to tell me over and over how he didnt understand and how he felt bad for not fixing me. I then decided that I needed to take time apart from him to figure out how to get back on track for me, to try and get better and heal. I realized that trying to be in a relationship with him at the moment someone who just isnt in my everyday life to understand firsthand my situation and then doesnt hearappreciate what Im saying, then freaks out that he cant fix me, etc, just is not conducive to me getting better. I told him all of this, told him I love him but I need to focus my attention right now on me and my health, this is what I need to do to heal. I also told him I cant give our relationship the attention it needs right now. We took a few weeks not communicating as much. When Id check in and say hi, he didnt ask me how I was feelingtreatmentanything about my life at all. He literally responded to a simple Hi, hows your day going by responding with a giant text about how he was not managing it so well, how he was struggling etc, etc. I ultimately now feel angry bc of his behavior. He then asked to have a phone call to discuss his feelingshow bad he feels without me in his life and I told him I cant do that bc theres nothing more I can do, he has to accept the facts as they are, there is no point to getting into another emotional discussion where all he says is how bad he feels. I dont think hes a jerk I think hes just ignorant and literally lacks the ability to understand. But at this point I feel like this is a problem I cannot get past if Im to have any future with him. Ive become so angry too lately bc I feel like even though hes unable to deal with this, instead of trying to educate himself, learn more and understand, hes just being selfish. Does anybody think Im being insensitive, or unfair?",
    "I don't know what to do, and I feel like i'm drowning I am done with all of this. Ive never had any real friends, never been in a relationship, im not close with any family members, and the only texts I receive are from my parents, which usually just keep mocking me for not having a girlfriend and asking when im finally going to go on my first date. When I was in high school I was addicted to pills, and I also developed an eating disorder, and nearly died twice. I remember spending time in mental hospitals, spending time in intensive care, etc., and the only person who even came to visit was my mother, who came once after an overdose, and she just said she was disappointed in me and grilled me about why I did what I did. In the past 3 months Ive lost 3 friends, one to suicide, one to a drug overdose, and one to cancer. I feel like im going to explode, and I dont know what to do, and I dont have anyone to turn to. I need advice on how to move forward, and how to get out of this situation, please. I dont know how much longer I can go on like this anymore.",
    "Im going to be alone forever, and i believe its better i kill myself. I think no matter how much i change, Ill be treated like shit. Im 21 years old and Ive tried dating since i was 18. I hate life, i want to die. Changing so much for people until you look like some one else entirely. I cant find any motivation to keep going. Why live anymore in a world where im treated like shit. I think in the end, Ill be miserable alone and with people. No one cares about me. Christian, atheist, anyone. No one cares in this world. Not even other depressed. Im going to just write my note and get to where i have a high chance of suicide.",
    "Overbearing Parents Ive been raised as the only child in my family. My mother always constantly barges into my room somehow forcefully making her way through the lock to check up on me  I am 18 at random parts of the night. Additionally, she always harasses me saying that I am basically a failure and should just attend community college. Then, she consistently tries to wear my makeup, perfume, and steals my hair products everyday claiming she bought it with her money. I have my father whos always a supporter of my mother and says that Im a human being with no emotion. I just feel so trapped. Some days I just sit by myself in the dark and just cry. Theyre a constant burden on my back and im not able to hang around people unless theyre literally given a background check and the parents meeting. I have no freedom. Im 18 and they still treat me like a kid. Whenever I bring it up, theyll say oh youll always be my daughter even when youre 40  its pointless. Idk what to do but all I know is that if I have to spend one more minute of quarantine with them im going to cry. I love them but this isnt it.",
    "Concerned friend wrote me a letter My best friend wrote me a letter last night. She cleared out her childhood bedroom and we thought it would be fun to read trough old diaries since Im not doing great at the moment. But we eventually read mine too. I forgot how dark my notes were. It was honestly very eye opening but I think reading about my suicidal thoughts, in the current situation concerned her a lot. This morning, she handed me the letter, saying Id have to read it when Im feeling down. She wrote about our friendship, how we give each other the courage to be ourselves, how much Ive helped her, how much she wants to be there for me. I read the letter twice, I cried both times. Now I feel guilty for worrying her. How do I respond?",
    "I need help My english is bad sorry Ok so I have bad migraines every 2 days and I googled it and it says that depression, neck pain and migraines are connected. I go to therapy but I dont take antidepressants. My suicidal thoughts are awful lately and when this stupid corona thing goes away should I talk to my therapist and talk to her about it? How should I tell her that I need antidepressants? I really need them because I read that they can help with depression and migraines at the same time.",
    "Has anyone ever felt like their brain has shut off? Thats the best I could describe how Ive been feeling for almost 2 months. Im just overwhelmed with everything thats going on in my life and the world to the point where its hard to keep up. Ive been hearing nothing but negativity thats been happening in this world and it caused an overload to my brain. Its been difficult focusing and Ive been feeling more apathetic. Nothing brings me pleasure anymore. One of the things that helped me cope with my depression has made me lose interest in it. Its bothering me a lot because it happened so abruptly. Has anyone overcame this? If so how?",
    "Loneliness Lately, Ive been feeling quite lonely. For a long time, Ive dreamed of a best friend, the kind that you never let go. The kind that truly cares for you, that you can be yourself around with, do fun and stupid things with, talk about everything under the moon and that you feel a connection to like no other. I have friends. Maybe even a few I would call best friends. Weve been friends from childhood. But we barely talk or see each other. Im talking five times a year or something. I started feeling left out already when we went to highschool and it got a lot worse over time. Now that weve all gone to collage, I feel more distant from them than ever. I have even considered cutting off ties with them. I dont think I know how to build friendships anymore, or trust someone enough to become that best friend. I crave friendship and company. Im not the greatest at keeping up with people either, through text mostly but also otherwise. I always feel like the other should initiate the conversation, and I almost always end up waiting days for them to text me back, because Im too shy to.",
    "Stuck between moving forward and killing myself Some background information My GF of almost 3 years broke up with me over half a year ago and ever since I have been severely depressed. It wasnt a bad breakup, just a sad one. Shortly after the breakup, I noticed I wasnt dealing with it well at all. I couldnt do anything but cry and wishing she would come back. I went to a psychologist and he diagnosed me with Major Depressive Disorder MDD. I still had friendly contact with my ex, but I was just hoping she would come back. After an emotional call, she told me to take a few months for myself. And so I did, but I just got worse. I couldnt do anything. I stopped working, studying, playing sports, everything, because I had no energy or motivation for it. I almost got admitted to a psych ward, but it was still my choice to do stay there or not. I chose to not do it as I had a bad feeling about it. October of last year, I contacted her again and we met for the first time in months. It was supposed to just be friendly, but talking about the relationship was inevitable. She said to me she would never take me back. She wasnt angry, but just serious and honest. It broke me even more. The next day I sent her a goodbye text and was close to killing myself. She called just in time and we had a good talk. Though a few weeks later, when things look better and we actually had made plans to meet up as friends, I got a panic attack and sent her emotional texts. She sent me a long one back and then blocked me. I then attempted suicide again, this time getting hospitalized. I have not directly spoken to her since. It was either via other people or letters. Last December I sent her a suicide letter, but I quickly regretted it. My brother sent her a message for me, apologizing to her and telling her Im okay. Then for Christmas, I sent her a simple card, but never got a response nor did I expect one to be honest.",
    "I'm 16 and I'm a mess When I discovered that one of my favorite games was hugely hated on the internet, it made me feel miserable, like my taste was inferior, like I was so dumb to like that thing. I spent, no, waisted so much time defending that game online, and it left me with a terrible sour taste in my mouth when playing it afterwards, like the voices of the people criticizing me were echoing in my head, telling me how stupid I was, how wrong I was to like that game. I eventually didnt even finish it. I couldnt play it anymore. And it keeps going. It still happens, I still get that hot feeling in my head when someone hates on something I love and Im passionate about, I feel dumb and I wonder, I wonder if everyone is like me on that regard? Or is there something wrong with me? Is there something wrong with all of us? Im not even clearly sure about the mental illnesses that I have. I feel like I made so many mistakes, so many unachieved things, so many failures in my life,that may not seem much, and Id agree, but mean so much to me, I feel like I have so many flaws, and those thoughts, sometimes, theyre so loud, theyre like screams. And my throat is so sore that I cant scream louder than them, so I just want to be deaf. Sometimes I just want to end it all. I regret so much things I did, so much things I didnt, so much things I said, so much things I couldve said.. my mind feels poisoned, to the point where it can physically hurt. Im slowly heading to become a social failure, with no lover, no friends and no job. My grades are dropping, I dont do any work, sometimes Im so tired at school that all of my body hurts from it litteraly, its a horrible feeling. Its a bit more complex than that too, I cant describe it but I hate it very much. everyone keeps mocking me, sometimes for stuff I dont even understand. Im slowly becoming paranoid of doing anything in public, like Im always doing something wrong and poeple will laugh at me, its like Ive been put in a game I dont know the rules of.",
    "What should I be doing to get out of this..I am a solo warrior and I am sure I can beat it. I am slipping into a very dangerous world again where I am kind of staying alone and having recurrent episodes of going to my dreaded balcony. I am coping by taking a shot of diazepam and whisky. Its gone to the point that now I can barely sleep in a week easily for more than 4 hours a night and I am constantly fighting people all around. If I dont have someone around I get delusional that I am at fault and this constant selfloathing and a sense of not having done enough is driving me crazy to the point that I think I am worthless. I am also professionally undergoing a transition to a new role and in between, I fought with a lot of my close buds and a couple of my relatives and this is now showing on my face and I can barely smile now. This is a sad state of affairs and I am now seeking professional counselling online with people who have undergone this. I think I fucked up quite bad this time and I really need someone to talk to. Friends who I thought would understand have kind of given up on my constant emotional outbursts and I have now shut myself in. I had a really rough start to this year and things have been very bad at home and I have been all solo on this and I have got myself into situations where I have been super drunk and tried to OD on any tablet I could find. Strangely in my office environment, I come across as pretty normal but sadly . I dont know this is so fuckin messed up that now I cant even reach out to anyone at home and here in this foreign country. What is my best action plan? Any ideasno I dont want to go to doc as this is just 16 days to pass before I go back to my home country and I am kind of reserved to again open up. Meditation doesnt help. I am also having random episodes of night terrors and recently I have started drifting into a weird halo.. I have even called one of my friends to come over and he doesnt have any idea whats happening for 4 days just to have someone around to ensure I dont fuck up anything.",
    "Depression and anxiety came back I havent been depressed or anxious since I was 12 I attempted suicide and was admitted into a hospital a year or so later I was discharged with all my new coping skills, come 6 years later I got scammed out of 400 bucks thats literally all I had and some of my friends so Im in debt and cant help pay my part of the bills, I dont have anxiety or depression medicine anymore so I take sleeping pills to slow down my heart rate but its beats like a drum all day long, Ive been getting 3 hours of sleep the past few nights and I cant eat anymore, I was looking at my pills and feel like downing more just to feel numb from this pain any kind words help. Thank you",
    "just another depressed post everyone will ignore I dont want to kill myself but I dont want to continue too ik this will go unnoticed like a billion other posts here so I can rant whatever I want the thing is imagine the worst personality , introverted guy , that no one loves , because hes too weird to talk to thats basically me and for the same reason having minimal Friends that come and go is very common for me I hate being pitied , but then I feel most of my friend are talking to me just because they are pitying me thats it having no real reason for life is my problem thanks for not reading, Because everyone knows no one does , this is a shit subreddit anyway byeee have a good day hugs all around",
    "To everyone who actually took time to read this, thank you for caring for me, a random stranger who probably doesn't deserve getting much help anyways. I got depression around the age of 11, but I just never bothered to get myself help until I was close to really cracking down from all the stress and anger Id hold in from all my encounters with my sister and her husband. We dont get along, and they always gang up on me, saying how my best friend did this better than me, I was always so bad at this or that, or how I was so fake and I always lied to them. They say other things too. My mom started this nightly ritual for me, and it really helps. Shed take Vaseline, which would help heal wounds, and shed spread it all over my arm where Id hurt myself. Then after that she takes this long seethrough sash, and shed tie and secure it on my arm so I dont pick at my wounds and scabs at night, because I do that a lot just so I could feel the pain. But every time in the morning and afternoon, Id always reopen and add more cuts and pinches onto my arms. This really stresses out my mom because I never stop, even if she really begs me to. I just get mad at her and say that it helps me. Today, I had gotten into a pretty bad argument with my sister and brotherinlaw. The previous night, I snuck my iPad into my room no electronics in my room, and I stayed up till 4 am playing and talking with friends, who were pulling an allnighter. It was fun, until my brother in law read my messages without me know and he found out. He got really pissed, and they enforced my already strict parental controls on my iPad, and now I can only strictly use it for a few hours at a time. They also deleted a few of my apps they didnt like me using because they didnt use it and found it a waste of time the apps were things like TikTok and some games. While I was using my iPad, my brother in law got all in my face and pointed out how I already used my iPad for 4 hours already, so he told my sister to block my iPad so I could stop using it."
