    "My bf just broke up with me and it's triggering my depression Im 22f and yesterday my long distance boyfriend of almost 2 years broke up with me. I thought everything was going fine so it was completely out of the blue for me. He said he didnt think things would ever work between us and he doesnt love me the same way anymore. I am devastated, Ive gone between crying, sobbing, sleeping, and thinking how to kill myself. I just never want to feel like this again, I dont want anyone to be able to hurt me. I dont do well socializing because Im afraid if I open up people wont accept me or are going to hurt me. He was the only one I thought I could trust. Hes left it open to being friends, but all I can think about is how hes not mine anymore and Ill never be able to kiss or hug him the same way again. I was desperate and talked to him today because I felt like I needed him, it didnt turn out well. Other than him and his friends I dont have a lot of friends. Im part of a friend group but Im not really close with any of them and they have kicked me out of the group before for not being active enough. The only person I really have is my mom and she has to go to work tomorrow so I dont know what to do.",
    "Does anyone else punch themselves as a way of self harm? Every once in awhile Ill punch myself in the face when a very intense bout of depression sets in. Usually its when someone starts talking in depth about sex and relationships, and the magic surrounding it. Its therapeutic and part of myself thinks I should be punished. I guess I cant really express my emotions either because people will find it too dramatic and silly, as I have been told before. No one takes my emotions seriously. Im too afraid to cut my wrists and the endorphin rush from the punches feels so good afterwards, but it hurts and my face swells up. I make sure not to hit my jaw. I feel like its the only way I can calm down. Everything feels so smooth after Im done. Ill only do this every so often though, its not consistent but I think I might start doing it again. Does anyone else self harm in this way? Have you found an outlet to stop self harming?",
    "High functioning depression Hi everyone, Ive been lurking in depression subreddits for a while but I finally decided to post. I have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and clinical depression. I was diagnosed when I was 17 but since I started university my depression has become more high functioning, and there have been times when people do not believe me when I open up about my depression. Even when I talked about my PTSD from a sexual assault and a mentally abusive relationship, some people did not believe me. I shower two times a day every day, I finish all my assignments a week ahead of time and I make sure I get near perfect grades on everything, I work 56 days a week, Im a clean freak who has to do laundry and dishes every single day or else I panic. My anxiety disorder screams at me to get these things done or else my anxiety will eat me alive. Ive had people who tell me my depression isnt real because their depression had them unable to leave their bed. When I talked about my struggles with suicidal thoughts I was skirted to the side and seen as a liar, while someone else was praised for their struggles because they were unable to continue going to college due to their depression. I felt like screaming that depression is not a contest. It ruins lives and there is no one size fits all depression. I just need support that my struggles are valid.",
    "Help with Husband's Depression My husband and I dearly love each other and hes going through a rough time right now. Hes really depressed and I feel like there isnt much more I can do to help him. He seems fine at work we work at the same place but as soon as I ask for help around the house, his entire demeanor shifts. He used to always be so willing to help me and going out of his way to do so. Now he wont even sort his own clothes. Its been really hard for us. Im working almost two full time jobs and then I come home to do all of the cooking and the cleaning. When my husband comes home, he goes straight to videogames and will play them for hours. My husband wont seek out therapy and Ive convinced him to go to the doctor to have his meds looked at. Ive tried talking with him many times to see whats wrong and he just says I dont know. What can I do to help him?",
    "It’s over My friendship with a boy I love has seemingly finally come to an end. I lack the strength to get over him and its been months. Im too low and tired. I honestly dont think Ill ever see him again and it kills me. I dont know how my life could ever get better at this point. Alone for 4 years. Too shy to even use social media to make friends. Lost my new job due to another lockdown. I dont imagine Ill ever get over him. Every day it seems less likely Ill live to see 25. Im 24 now and my birthday is in spring. The only reason I am alive is because I dont want to upset my mother or brother Sometimes when I cross the street I dont look for cars because at least then theyd see it as an accident and not blame themselves I know thats wrong, I am just so so low and alone in this life I just wish he cared again",
    "I hate myself, i need an outside perspective. I feel like a complete failure at everything i do. Everyone in my life says im so talented or that im smart or have potential but every time i hear someone say that it makes me want to shoot myself in the fucking face. Whenever i hear these things my ego just gets bigger and it gives me a reason to think  Maby im not so bad which i then immediately disprove by doing some other stupid shit, i cant get get relationships right, im pretty sure my girlfriend is slowly loosing interest in me, and i dont blame her, i would too. Im not good at sex and fail to pleasure my partner, im terrible at work and am constantly overshadowed by new employees despite my seniority, im failing all my classes at school and i havnt spoken to my friends at all recently due to a lack of motivation. I feel like im looking in on the world from outside a glass door, and i hate it, i hate myself, i hate every decision that i make, will make, or have made, and i wish nothing but the worst upon myself. Im at a point where i do all of these things and feel no remorse, i feel no sadness, im just an empty sad excuse for a man looking for my next momentary shot of dopamine to keep me from loosing my mind and realizing what a piece of shit i am. Thanks for your time.",
    "I am so tired I have entered this on a different subreddit, but no one seems to be too responsive besides one person who I am really thankful for. I want to hear more from others.... Im a very introverted person, and Im smart. I know what I should do to get help, I know what the sources of my problems are, I know what I have to do. But I am so tired. To make a long story short, I was emotionally, physically, verbally, and sexually abused for the first eleven years of my life, and now I am adopted by my godparents, who I highly respect as my mother and father. Anyways, like I said, Im a private person. This means people say things to me without thinking how I might feel about it. I also do not share my past memories with others I need to move on. I cannot blame them for their ignorance, that would be rude. So when people get mad, and yell at me, I leave my face blank and take it. But its been hard lately. When my mom gets upset with me, practically anything that leaves my mouth is talking back or an excuse. It makes me feel like her scolding me about being ungrateful means I dont deserve what she gives me that I dont deserve a loving mother, I deserve what I had, and that my feelings are excuses. But I take it, and I bounce back. Those outside of family know me as a happy, innocent, smart, and responsible person. If I am ever anything except some state of happy, people think its weird of me. Because I always get back on my feet without them knowing I fell. But I am so tired of getting back up. Of forgiving everyone that has hurt me over and over. Of taking all of those offensive comments silently. Of fulfilling the expectations of those around me when I already expect perfection out of myself. Of trying to put effort into my appearance only to look at my own hands and feel revolted. Of acting. Of not feeling good enough for anyone.I sometimes wish I had a normal life, but look back on it and would rather it be me than anyone else. And I want someone to see that.",
    "When searching for happiness my mind turns up a blank I am a 26 year old male, living a pretty normal life, I have a good job, still live with my parents. That being said I still havent figured out what I want to do with my life and feel like I have been living on autopilot for most of the recent years. I feel like I have been going through some form of depression since I was a teenager, nothing major but I certainly feel a lack of motivation, a dissatisfaction with myself, apathy, cynicism and anxiety. Whenever I try to think about what I want to do with my life I just get a blank. Whenever I feel sad and try to think what would make me happy I also get a blank Lately I have been so dissatisfied with everything that I started asking myself, what world would I want to live in? where would I be happy? Unfortunately, I cant think of anything. Maybe Im asking the wrong questions but why cant I imagine myself in a happy place?",
    "I hate my body and my thoughts Ever since I was little I was always struggling with my physical appearance. I have been told throughout my life that I was overweight and that just screwed over my image even more. Here I am feeling guilty cause I had a bit of grill chicken and honestly Im just tired. Im tired of thinking of exercise as a mere chore. Im tired that I cant enjoy food anymore, and the fact that my mom cooks so much doesnt help. My family all says Im lean and normal but I feel so disfigured. My shoulders are too broad and my arms are flappy making me look twice my size, my thighs are gigantic and are covered with cellulite. I really hate my mirrors and if I could break them I would. My weight is always in the middle of normal or overweight and one slice of cake could tip it off. Ive been active and even trying to just eat healthy foods but I still hate myself. I think my thoughts have screwed over and long for the underweight body. At this point I think normal looks fat.",
    "Is it just me, or when depressed, is it better to make yourself sad than to be numb? Bit of backstory here. So Ive been Depressed for six months, just that slow train that you cant hop off of. So it always starts with Numbness, and because every time I feel happy, I can still feel the numbness underneath, I dont trust it. So I listen to sad songs, and my triggers, so that I can feel anything besides numbness. Does anyone else do this? Or am I just crazy?",
    "Texas ice storm - feeling guilty &amp; overwhelmed I live in Texas, and my community is in need of a lot of help. I was out of town for the worst of it, and was lucky enough to come home to all of utilities still on, no damage to the house, nothing. I even had a good amount of food in the pantry. I housed a few friends, and donated to some organizations, but still feels like Im not doing enough. Specifically Ive been invited to volunteer this weekend alongside other people from my industry. However, yesterday I wanted to get my house in order first, but ended up lying in bed, and eventually falling asleep for a few hours, because it all just seemed so overwhelming. Cue guilt for neither volunteering nor getting anything done around the house. Today Im in the same boat. I apologized and told the volunteer crew Id definitely be coming today, but again the house is still a mess, and I need to get it back in shape before I go back to working full time tomorrow. Funny thing is that I could totally do both, but my depressionanxiety tells me I just need to hide in bed all day instead. Frustrating, because four months ago I started taking medication been in therapy for longer and its been incredibly helpful, but it cant seem to take the edge off during this time of crisis....even though Ive hardly been affected personally. Im spiraling because I feel such a duty to help others, but I know I need to help myself first...and seems that I can do neither right now. Any helpadvicesupport would be appreciated!",
    "I don’t know what’s going on And then that summer I got my shit together, started training for soccer,and I thought I healed. But I guess I didnt because junior year here we are. I feel abandoned. I feel alone. I feel lost. These things never bothered me before, but why now???? WHY IS IT PULLING ME DOWN NOW? I NEVER HAD PROBLEMS THESE PROBLEMS ALL JUNIOR YEAR?! You know my ex, got over me so quick. She already found a prom date, and she and her best friend replaced me with another guy. Double replaced. This guy they replaced me with is annoying as hell though, but hes so much smarter and more athletic than me. I guess they did better than I did. Im just here alone, no one to have my back. I guarantee you, no one would give two fucks about me. No one thinks about me. No one is there to check up on me. I have no one. And its killing me. I thought loneliness was strenght, cus Kobe was lonely, and he became one of the greatest athletes of all time. So I thought me being lonely was gonna help. But lately, I dont know, hey Im sorry for a mess of a story I just told. I just need some help and needed to let it all out.",
    "The Story of This Year I havent stopped crying, Ive been using drugs and alcohol to mask my responsibilities and now everything has creeped up on me. I cant stop reflecting about everything this year and the pros and cons and its hard to see the positive ahead. Ive lost my dog, my 2 best friends, Im a couple thousand dollars in debt, Im failing uni and my head is so fucked up I cant think straight. Suicide is constantly on my mind and I cant help but think its the only way out. I dont know what to do or who to speak too. I cant take out anymore loans and I hate asking for help from the people I love and care about. So Im coming to reddit for some advice, some positive thoughts or anything. Im lost and hopeless and I think its coming to the end of my time. How do I get past this? I dont think I can do this anymore.

    "Looking For Coping Methods My depression has been really declining lately. I live in a really bad household and Im being targeted by my grandfather whom nobody will stand up to and if I try to stand up for myself, Im the one in the wrong. Hes been yelling at me over small things, calling me all sorts of names, leaving stuff at my door for me to trip over, and more. This especially hurts because him and I used to be friends when my mother was the one being horrible and nasty She calls me disgusting, a few slurs, etc he was the one that was always there to comfort me and try and talk it out with her. Now, however, it feels like that never happened. It feels like I was the one who did something wrong, and I dont know what. Its seriously effecting my relationship with my boyfriend, friends, and myself. Its an incredible struggle to eat just a meal a day, my lips are getting torn because I pick at them, I cant ever get to sleep and stay asleep, its frustrating and since Im a teenager I cant leave this enviroment. What do I do to cope? I use music to try and melt away, I play games like animal crossing to stay distracted, I draw, I play ukulele, I just breathe and try to remember that it will pass. Im terrified of being suicidal, Ive attempted once and was lucky I know Im capable even if I dont want to and that scares me. What are some methods you guys use to deal with these sort of things? I desperately want to get better, but it feels like I cant here.",
    "Help with ex girlfriend (trying to stay friends) (M29) (F28) So my ex girlfriend was going through a rough time with her depression and ended the relationship to say that it wasnt fair on me and that she needed to focus on herself. She still wanted to be friends and weve chatted off and on for a few weeks but recently shes gone radio silent, leaving my messages unread. Even after we broke up it had been a back and forth between who started conversations. I dont know if this is her way of letting things fizzle out entirely or if this is her depression taking a turn for the worst. I can see that shes been online thanks invasive apps tracking loginactive times so at least I know shes still alive but Im worried about her. Deep down I still love her and I care about her as a friend but Im a little lost on what to do. I want to give her space but I suppose I also want a definitive answer as to whether things are over in terms of friendship and I feel guilty and selfish. I dont want to smother her or take too much of a step back but my experience of depression is nonexistent.

    "What do I do if I've attempted suicide, but years have passed since and I haven't really talked to a doctor about it? Do I just waltz in to my next doctors appointment and mention that Ive attempted, and that Im concerned about the effects its had on my health? Last time I tried to talk about my mental health with a doctor, they panicked and tried to get me involuntarily committed, despite no longer being an active risk to myself. Im afraid of doctors and my physical health has worsened as a direct result, but I really dont want to continue avoiding my issues like this.",

My life has been falling apart like a broken wall for the last couple of weeks and Im hardly happy anymore. I dont have a purpose. I cant do anything right and I dont deserve all my lovely friends and family! Since the day I was born i was surrounded with lovely people and Ive grew up worth them too, but I dont deserve them or what they have done. Im a waste of space and a wreck. I dont want to go anywhere or do anything because its gotten too bad! I find it hard to get up in the morning and talk to everyone.

I know very well, that this thought is not normal but damn I dream about being hospitalized, filled with pills just to forget that Im still alive. I dont want to be aware of anything. Im tired of life. Im mad at myself because I dont trust anyone enough to talk about my problems. I wish I had the balls to end it but I dont.

    "My insecurities are everyone’s plaything. Ive been through a lot and its insanely diffcult to open up about them, so it seems to family I act the way I do just because I chose to. Im constantly being made fun of for not doing certain things and I get really offended and uncomfortable. I prefer not to share what, but I usually tell them to quit it, yet theyre always like its a joke or youre so over dramaticbuzz kill. Now I dont ever say anything because now I have the reputation of being the negative Nancy of every social event. I even have a certain family member who pry into my business cause they want to know my secrets. Why isnt boundaries a thing anymore? Sometimes I think to myself I should just blurt out what Ive been through just to have a greater chance of letting them leave me alone, but its scary and personal. I cant even write them in a journal, to my past therapist who I saw for six months, or friends I trust. I hate myself everyday for always keeping things in. Im a coward. I feel trapped in my mind. Always telling myself to forget, but think about it everyday anyways. What do I do to change? How can I escape this constant degradation from people? Thanks for reading.",
    "Feeling so down and beating myself up for mistakes I dont feel like talking about whatever is going on in my post since it might be too long. So to simplify it I made a mistake asking someone from a laptop repair shop to back up files onto a hard drive. I didnt think too much about what I did so of course I wasnt surprised when my parents were mad at me. I tried to fix the situation by calling and texting to let them know of the situation. Then my mom just starts calling me out and calling me names cause I kept making mistakes. I get that I dont think through things sometimes and it gets to me, but my mom really tried to drag me through the dirt cause she thinks so highly of her golden child compared to me. It got to me and I fought back verbally. I was so mad at her at that moment and couldnt believe the things that she said. Im now sure that whatever my mom said is going to and will affect me. I just barely have the motivation to do anything at the moment. As you can tell, Im probably not doing so well and would be down to talk or chat with someone.",
    "The Story of This Year The male room mate out of the 2 that were sleeping together ended up finding another girl he liked and he spent a lot of time with her which left me and the girl to get very close. Now all these people I consider my close friends, but the girl and I became really close and spent a lot of time together. We were just friends, and thats the way I liked it. We would spend every night chatting and laughing and having a grand old time while my other roommate was off with the girl he liked. The girl he liked who studies nursing ended up leaving for placement. She had to move away for 6 weeks to study so he spent more time with us at the flat. I started getting more and more depressed, just little things getting to me and stuff playing on my mind. One of my biggest stresses were bills and money. Our first electricity bill was close to 700 and that was for one month. I was so stressed about the next one that it made me really depressed. About 5 months after the first bill, our second one was due. About a month before I knew we would receive it I tried my hardest to start looking for ways I could pay it in case it was as high as the first. I desperately were looking for jobs, I started thinking about selling my stuff and I couldnt think of anything. So I came to the conclusion that I might not be able to pay it, and that if I could, when the next bill came out I would have to do this all over again. So I decided it might be best for me to move back to college. I ended up telling my room mates and they werent happy about it, we got into a fight and upset me so much. I was so stressed and sad that I thought I couldnt take it anymore. So I went to my medicine draw and grabbed every pill I could find and took them. It ended up being about 70 different pills in total. After doing it I freaked out and called my house mates, they both had left to go to a party. The girl came home and rushed me to hospital while the other one stayed at the party to get drunk.",
    "Family crises She swears they didnt do anything sexual. Im kinda losing my shit right now..... Ive always been suicidal. My mom caught me in 5th grade trying to kill myself. I love my boys more than anything in the world, and I love her. Shes got an amazing family that supports her no matter what as the should. So she talked to her family about what happened and they all have her confidence. I dont have any family here, nowhere to go when things get rough. Shes just acting like nothing happened. Im extremely upset about it, she said they didnt do anything, but I cant stop thinking about her fucking some other guy in his boat. Before the Corona virus we went to 1 therapy session, and the woman diagnosed me with severe anxiety disorder, and that we need to get to the bottom of my problems so I could be a better man for her. We have a phone conference scheduled for Wednesday. I couldnt sleep last night, my heart has been beating out of my chest, I cant relax, and my breaths are short but frequent. So far its not let up, Im sitting in an empty church parking lot right now. I wanted to post this to get it off my chest and maybe give me relief? The feelings of suicide are very strong right now, but I could never do that to my boys. I have no where to turn, and I dont know what to do about it.

    "I am depressed.. nofap 200+ day plus Hello I have been on an incredible streak with nofap, which i thought would help with my depression. I lost my counter but it should be over 200 days now. I used to suffer everyday by watching porn and edgingclimaxing with a pillow or hand in order to fall asleep. It was a huge struggle for many years, but now, I find it easy not to do both those things. Potentially having someone to sleep with has helped me not relapse, however, I have not felt any benefits of Nofap and its frustrating. I was depressed before, Im depressed now.

She excites me greatly, but its difficult for me to have sensation there or to will myself to get hard because I have thoughts like I am too small or I remind myself she has had sex before me and Im just so in my head, she wants me to be dominant but I really act submissive. I work out, I am extremely fit. I am very physically attractive according to many people, I have a lot of charm as people love to point out to me. Why dont i see any of it? why do i not like myself? i dont have a semblance of a identity and my brain is so foggy. I discussed with my therapist, and Meds are on the table but i dont think that will help me be more confident with myself... i cant meditate for long because my thoughts are just so painful.

    "how do i ask for help so for a few years now ive considered myself depressed but i dont know how to talk about my feelings to anyone. i tried once to tell my mom that i was depressed, since ive never actually been diagnosed, and that ive self harmed and had suicidal thoughts. i never actually told her that i was so close to actually doing the deed per say because how do you tell your mom that her child wants to end their life. ive spend days laying in my bed and not moving a muscle, not eating, not talking to anyone even my siblings, i didnt even have the energy to get up to use the restroom. i had no energy whatsoever that i couldnt even cry i just laid there in silence looking at my wall and hugging my dogs as they walked in and out of my room to sleep. for so long ive wanted to ask to go to therapy but anytime i talk about being sad and not feeling like myself my mom and sister tell my that i have no reason to be sad and that im just faking it. i think this all stems from childhood trauma but mostly from a past relationship that never shouldve been a relationship. it was so toxic and the worst first real relationship i ever had. it ruined me mentally and emotionally. the jealousy, the controlling, the emotional abuse, the pain we caused each other, just the whole relationship was horrible and i deeply regret ever getting into a relationship with her. it was always so crazy to me how everyone thought our relationship was perfect and nothing but happiness when in reality it was tearing me apart yet i couldnt get away from it. maybe i stayed because i didnt wanna be alone or maybe it was because i liked the attention she gave me, all i know it there was never any actual love in the relationship. it was just lust and the thought of us being together and having a future. i just dont wanna be sad anymore. i want to happy like actually happy not just moments of relief and distraction from the pain. how do i tell someone that i want or need help without feeling so vulnerable and embarrassed by my emotional baggage",

I have never taken a day off for no reason. I am sure this will pass and Ill be fine again. But what do I do in the meantime? What do I say when people ask if everything is ok? Or when they say something is up with me? There is literally nothing for me to be upset about right now. I am afraid I am going to come off whiny or just self pitying.",

Yesterday this irritation got so bad that I felt it was hard to contain it. It feels like pain and burning in my head. I am currently not working due to sick leaves. I will be seeing my psychologist tomorrow. Any suggestions? Any food or activity that would help me?",
    "Asking people to call to wake you up? Have you done it? Did it help? Did it make the person you asked feel weird, even if you were close? Looking at my daily schedule the amount I sleep in and nap is the most unhealthy and detrimental part I spend a lot of time ruminating and having negative thoughts and then feel bad since I oversleep, as I am sure a lot of you are familiar with. I asked my friend to call me today and it helped. Even with alarms I dont get up. Hearing an actual person helped, I think.",
    "I want to be happy again. Goal Currently I am all timer sad and want to be happy. I am neither a good person nor a bad person. I am somewhere in the middle or maybe totally out of circle. I dont know. I feel like I am living three lives. One which I show to my Family, one to friends and excolleagues. I am jobless. And one my true self which I show to myself only. Of course any differences in personality from my true self I manage by pretending someone else in my other two lives. But as soon as I enter my room and after carefully slowly locking my door I throw away the mask I was wearing and then I can clearly see the differences in my voice, thoughts, body language and goals, if any. My body feels so relieved. Then I start getting back in my true zone where I forget the tasks and goals I had planned in my mind. And I start feeding myself the worthless shit on Internet. At that time, I am only looking for that temporary dopamine hits because nothing simpler was giving me any joy. I started losing myself in weed. I sometimes was stealing weed from my friends or roommates. After smoking for at least 3 years, a small joint was not that powerful anymore to bring down the curtains covering my real life problems. So, I jumped to eating. Now again, simpler food was not any joy. Junk is pretty much gonna hit the Dspot. Small meals mean less dopamine. Give me more and more. Dont worry, Ill puke the previous and eat again until I am so wasted by the effort of eating  throwing  eating throwing and of course the taste of food. There are consequences too. Bloating, Gas, Always upset. But nothing can stop me from doing it again and again atleast from last 2 years nothing has stopped me. Then in search for more dopamine I look for porn. Again, simple means no joy. Fell into HeteroBBC  Trans  Sissy. Now I dont imagine me having sex with girl instead I am that girl and big funk is fucking me. I started dreaming about dicks. Bought a vibrating dildo.",
    "I hate winter My therapist and I even had a 15 minute discussion about how winter is just awful. Now I dont mind looking at snow. The visual aesthetics are absolutely appealing. A white Christmas is great. I like chucking a snowball at my boyfriend. And hot chocolate is my favorite. However, why is it so fucking dark? Sunset at 5? Are you kidding me? Im exhausted, time confused, miss the sun, and I swear to God if it rains again at 40 degrees, Im hibernating for the rest of the year. I hate driving in the dark. I have to go outside to get to the basement to do my laundry, which thanks to last nights snow, means going through an inch and half of snow, on top of cold mud, into a rocky cold basement at the bottom of some rickety ice covered steps, just to put something in the washing machine. We have multiple cats, so I have to dump cat boxes daily, which makes a daily run to the trashcan, now in the dark. Driving in the dark. I hate how dark it is. I hate that it looks like midnight at 6 pm. Its just absurd. How do you all survive winter without living in a cocoon of blankets on the bed? Side note, yes I am aware of S. A. D. S, but I have no medically confirmed diagnosis of it currently, though its possible. Confirmed major depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder. TLDR HOW DO I KEEP SANE IN WINTER? ?",
    "Can a 14yo have depression and anxiety This got worse and worse until I thought about suicide almost everyday. I also had a crush on a girl who toyed with me and always said stuff like I miss you, I like your curls or lets go out some more we never go out alone. We had my 14 birthday this summer and I threw a party shes 16 so alcohol was involved and we start leaving the people and going to bed to cuddlewe didnt had a condome and dry humped she always made me hope that someday we could be. We are one day in school and we got a new student. They where together after 2 days they didnt know each other. I also tend to forget how to walk when near people my age and try to avoid contact even with eyes. I dont go to social gatherings anymore bc of this and covid. So I dunno if I have depression cause I felt no joy in the last 2 years. But I also dont want to be an 14yo deep fake depression boy so I didnt talk with no one about thisother than 2 friends Pls answer me and help me to find out if I have depression.

    "I feel empty and I don’t know how to fix it. To the point where it hurts Before I was diagnosed with clinical depressionlast year I was going through a tough time , but I dont know if I came back or not. Its something that comes and goes every few days, and sometimes itll stay for weeks. I just have the empty feeling, and it gets tight in my chest. I feel like Im missing something but I dont know what. Do I need a boyfriend? But Im only 16 is it necessary? But then again that would be nice.. Is it my grades? I just dont know what to do. I dont wanna continue drugs and behaviors that fill the pain in for only a couple hours anymore. I want to fix it. I dont know if this is just a need for attention, but Id rather not tell my parents not anyone. I want to fix the problem on my own. I dont want anyone to think Im weak, I just want this problem fixed. I know I sound over dramatic but it sucks. Im not good at explaining things, I cant focus, and i dont like asking for help so Im sorry if reading this is a mess.",
    "Should I? First time posting and on my phone, sorry about the format. Im 27f at a breaking point with my depression and anxiety. Im a stay at home mom with two kids and my husband works all the time. The last couple of weeks or so Ive been angry, constantly angry about everything and I cant pinpoint the cause of it. A friend told me I was angry because of depression. Ive been fighting with it for my entire life and today Ive considered getting antidepressants...but for some reason Im so, so scared because my whole life Ive been taught that theyre for crazy people or itll change me completely and Ill always be dependent on a pill to be happy and never be able to be happy on my own without it. I know it sounds really stupid...but I just need advice as to wether or not I should finally just get them. Will they really help me?? TIA",
    "I can’t describe what i felt anymore It will be 2months already since she broke up with me. I already give up to the thoughts that we will be back from each other cause its really impossible. Shes already happy with her someone new. For me I already accept it and its good to know that shes happy already. But its still hurt a lot to the point that theres no more tears to cry. My chest is feeling numb to the pain that Im feeling. My emotions is like a roller coaster right now Im feeling hurt later. I feel empty sad and later on i feel nothing no emotion. I dont know at what point of life is me right now",
    "Does anyone else feel like the saturation in their life is turned down? The best way I can describe how I feel is feeling as if someone has turned down the saturation in my life. I can feel emotions. When Im with friends and family or watch a funny video I laugh and smile, but it just feels empty? Lifeless? Like on a scale of 110 10 being the happiest I know I should be feeling a 10 and in general the situation is a 10 but for some reason I cant seem to get past a 5 at most. Its like my brain is saying this is funny you should laugh and feel happy but I just dont feel that? At least not fully. Its like my 5 is other peoples 10s, both are fully happy just one is less than the other. When other people are laughing so much theyre in tears and cant catch their breath Im only chuckling, even though I know the situation is funny. I cant even remember a time where I laughed so much I was in tears. When I laugh it almost feels like a chore or an automatic response that I could just as easily not do. This is hard to explain but when I laugh and smile its like im not physically feeling it. What I imagine true happiness to feel like is a warmness, something you can physically feel in your body, but when I smilelaugh the outside physically changes but inside I dont feel anything. It almost feels as if Im acting but Im not because I do know the situation is funny. Its like theres a disconnect somewhere. Its hard to explain. And this is just one emotion, I feel this with everything. The only emotions I seem to be able to feel the strongest are annoyanceanger and sadness, but even thats toned down, not saturated, lifeless.",
    "My girlfriend wants to commit s, I don't know what to do. Help Idk what to do. My girlfriend has been adamant lately that whe will commit suicide by the end of January. She has major chronic depression and on hee meds, but her parents were never supportive and doesnt believe in mental health, nor her conditions in general. Believing that shes just wasting her life. Her father wants to kick him out of house asap bec she came out as trans mtf, and couldnt really accept her sexuality, plus she dropped out school, and quit work this sem because everything was heavy for her and she doesnt have any energy to do something, even small things. Im just so scared that shes going to really do it. Idk what to do, I really want to tell this to her parents. But she told me dont ever tell them. And Im so scared, idk what to do. I want to write a letter to her parents and tell them this important situation atleast, would that be possible?",
    "I don't know how to deal with this anymore. Since I could remember Ive always been off emotionally, Ive tried therapy, and medications it never helped. I should probably give context but, I am just lonely to the point where I feel like nobody gives a shit if Im alive or dead, even though I know I have people that care. I get really kind of crazy if you will, when Im having a depressive episode. When it gets really bad I isolate myself from everyone around me, and it usually helps calm me down if Im getting to manic. This would work when I had school and saw people, I was able to sort of have a connection to the outside world, then Id go home and not talk to anyone and just listen to music and exist. Now that we have a selfquatantine all day Im just alone, and when I have these episodes I have no one to turn to. Even to my closest friends I feel like a burden, and I dont want them to worry, Im aware at how cliche I am. The last few days have been really hard, and I just dont know how much of this I can take while being alone. I just feel very panicky, alone, empty and depressed, and usually my episodes dont last several days, but this one is, and I dont know how to deal with it now. My only coping mechanism doesnt work anymore since I cant go to school then isolate myself. And its getting awfully painful just being me, and living like this. I know and hope itll be better soon, but right now things look awfully grim and I dont know what to do about any of yhis. I dont know what Im expecting from posting this, Im just hoping maybe writing it out could help somehow.",
    "venting because i need to (somewhat nsfw based on this sub's rules) recently ive just been drinking to feel something because im numb to my depression but its to the point where my drinking makes me brutally aware of my depression. i cant use drinking or drugs to help me feel anything anymore. i shouldnt have in the first place. but im at a point where i want to go to self harm to feel something. even if its a created feeling that lasts a couple of moments. and ik at some point that wont help anymore and ill become helplessly numb. and im coming to the feelings of suicide like theres no point. when im happy its amazing but it comes down in a crash and all the sudden im just absolutely numb again. and i used to do a lot of art but even that doesnt help anymore and ive lost interest in everything.",
    "Is it possible to date if I'm depressed? Ive been diagnosed in the end of 2018, but I honestly cant remember a time in my life where I havent been sad although it gets better at times. So I recently started dating my best friend and its been all good. Hes really understanding, supportive, has been there for me in my darkest times and things happened so naturally for us that it just felt right. But sometimes, I cant feel things as intensely as him and that makes me feel really bad. Like, I know I love him but there are days where I just cant find the motivation to do anything and it feels like my feelings get kinda blocked, so when he starts being affectionate towards me or something, Im just there like... yeah. We have talked about this a few times, but sometimes Im afraid Ill never feel things again and itll get impossible for us to handle and I really dont wanna be a burden for him. What do I do???? ?",

I dont feel like going to school any more and ask my parents if I can stay home and do it online. I recently moved schools and left all my old friends and now I literally have no one to talk to. I tried talking to my dad today but he was just shaking his head and agreeing with me no matter what I said. My step mom is acting like Im not even alive. My bio mom wont let me see my siblings, I try to and she says maybe next weekend she has said this since the beginning of this summer I Honestly dont know what to do at this point.",
    "I don't know what to do at this point other than end it. Nothing has helped so far. Just blamed me. I live with constant guilt. Whenever I make a mistake, I hurt myself. Consciously or not. I have scars up and down my arms and all over my fingers from stresspicking, and my shoulders and thighs and stomach are covered in selfharm scars. It does not matter if its a big mistake or a small mistake. I cannot deal with the guilt of fucking up even a little bit, so I hurt myself to punish myself. Its the only thing that makes me feel a little better when I fuck up. I have been sexually abused 3 times. The first instance started at the age of 10 and ended at the age of around 12. My childhood best friend had started acting really strangely, cutting me off for no reason and telling me he hated me and treating me like shit. Essentially, we made a trade I get to stay friends with him if I send him videos and pictures of myself. He never told me why he started acting this way. The second time was the worst one. There is serious background to this. I made a new best friend in 4th grade, and we have been super close ever since. We had a mutual crush on each other for years. In 9th grade, I couldnt handle the stress anymore, and set my suicide date as New Years 2017. By some stroke of luck, my best friend invited me to an Xbox party and talked to me all night long and distracted me from killing myself, and we confessed our feelings for each other that night and started dating on January 4th, 2017, during my 9th grade year. We have been together ever since. However, in 10th grade, he admitted to me that he had a fat fetish. I was mortified I was pretty overweight back then from stress eating, and had no self esteem, but I tried it out because I loved him. It was horrible. I told him we needed to stop doing that, and that I was going to get fit and lose weight. He then insisted that if I did that, he wouldnt love me anymore.",
    "I don’t want to feel depressed anymore Ive been depressed for 8 years now, and long story short its really been getting the best of me these past 3 months. I dont know why its all crashing down now. Im tired of feeling like this, I say I want to die but in reality I just want to escape. I finally want to be better. I just dont know how. Therapy doesnt seem to help, and Im willing to try anything to feel better. Every time I get to a good place mentally, something happens and Im back to square one. Im a mess I guess and just need help to get beyond this",
    "Do i need a therapist? ampx200B In the period between 14 years old eighth grade and now almost 18 a lot more things happened. My sister had to move out because she made my mother mentally broken, I had alcohol poisoning at school, we had a stepfather who made me and my mother mentally broken my mother had to go to the psychiatric hospital for a few months, i almost had to go to the childrens home which would probably have been a good decision and some more stuff which i cant talk about in detail cause it would take way to long. Now to the current situation. Lately since about 8 months I have a lot of worries and fears about my life. I often think that my life is worthless and that i did and do everything wrong. I have strong emotional fluctuations during the day but i never show them to my surroundings. Many praise me for being such a calm guy and always having everything under control I actually do almost no sport anymore that was one of only things that I enjoyed. I have no structure in my daily routine. On my days off, I sometimes lie around for hours on my bed and just think about it all the mistakes i have made and all the bad things that have happened. I dont really enjoy anything anymore beside listening to music or playing video games. I almost no longer write to my friends, sometimes only reply to messages after a few days or ignore them completely. Ive had suicidal thoughts for a few years now and then, but I couldnt do it to my mother  family because my mother would probably die from the loss and she means everything for me. I never harmed myself. I never opend up to anyone except my exbest friend i wrote about  and this subreddit rn. I never spoke to a professional therapist or something like that, but I think its about time, since all of this is a heavy burden and I just cant find a way out.",
    "Exercise doesn’t help that much I 25m have basically been somewhat depressed and unemployed since I finished grad school in September 2019. Since then and even before that I was probably depressed in grad school and most if not all of undergrad Ive found that while I like working out and exercising it doesnt make me feel that much better mentally. I was briefly seeing a therapist who suggested I make sure to exercise more often and more regularly. The thing is that I used to work out a lot and while it helps me feel better physically it doesnt do that much for me mentally. Are there any alternativesthings I can do that might help me more?

Couldnt sleep at night but then I spent the whole day in bed. After my mom bugged me a lot I got up and brushed my teeth by late evening. I feel like crying, I havent eaten anything.

    "How do you heal from the trauma of being unloved and emotionally neglected by your parents? Hello everyone, so Ive been depressed and lonely for a more or less long time. I fought a lot with loneliness especially, because its an issue I keep coming back to, even if I manage to tend to my various other issues well enough. Its the loneliness that dwells on me the most. I attempted to deal with my loneliness by trying to make friends and specifically by trying to find a romantic partner. I know what selflove is about and I know the premise behind it, which is to be able to be okay with not having anyone, because youre supposed to fill your life with your own love. But here is where I keep running into an issue No matter how much effort Id put into this, it would never be enough. There is no such thing as a void in my heart which everyone seems to talk about. I would say my heart feels pretty intact, actually. Im pretty fine with who I am. And Im told this is enough, because you cant possibly achieve a state where you genuinely love yourself, unless youre narcissistic. You can like yourself and enjoy your company, yes. And I do believe this is where Im at right now. And yet, Im still looking for someone else. An intimate companionship. A certain sense of belonging. And this is when it suddenly dawned on me Those are the things my parents could never give me. What do I do about this? How can one heal from this trauma?",

    "What to say to someone who talks about killing themselves and having depression? TW mentioned suicide wish. So I am not friends with this person, but I have followed them on social media for a very long time 4 years and have met them one time in person, when we were close in vicinity they live in a different country. We also wrote sometimes via dms about this and that. About 20h ago they posted a checklist for signs to look out for, if you suspect someone is going to take their life and they made a check behind nearly all of them. In the caption they talked how they want to die, how they feel like a failure and absolutely worthless with what they archieved or not archieved in life so far. The only thing holding them back from killing themselves is their fear of pain. They say nothing that we could comment would make her feel better. Is there something I can say, should I send them a help hotline? They said they already called a hotline but hung up after a short moment in waiting line. Is there something impactful, that I can say to prevent them from killing themselves?",

    "Finally able to get professional help but.... How do I do it correctly? Hi. Sorry that I cant split this long post into paragraphs, Im on mobile and it just hasnt been letting me do it. So, anyways... Ive been struggling with mental problems that are incredibly similar to common clinical depression symptoms loss of motivation, emotional numbness, insomnia, suicidal thoughts, anxiety attacks, low selfesteem, and some more we dont have to bring up since I was about 10 and continuing since then. Nobody has ever taken me seriously, and I feel worthless constantly, so Ive just put a bandaid on my problems and tried to ignore them. But its gotten to the point where Im crippling myself to a noticeable degree and I cry for days on end. So Ive decided to finally seek help. I think Ive found a therapist that interests me but... What do I do? I mean, I know how to bring up my insurance and payment methods in a professional manner but thats all I know I can do. Do I bring up my problems before the appointment so that she can be prepared, or do I wait? Whats the formality usually like for these things? And besides all this just to get the ball rolling, is there anything else I need to do that isnt obvious? I just want to get better so my family isnt so worried about me but I sincerely dont know. I feel like this sub could possibly help as Im sure someone here must be attempting recovery with a professional. Thank you for reading, I appreciate it more than you know.",
    "Please Help: Spontaneous Suicide Attempts - 25 y/o Female I asked her if she was fully honest with her psychiatrist about her suicide attempts and her ideation, and she admitted that she has downplayed it. I told her that my dream is simply to grow old together, and that I would fight for her life with everything I have. I suggested that she schedule an emergency appointment with her psychiatrist to discuss her recent attempt, to be transparent about her actual ideation, and to push for more serious treatment, as her and my life truly depend on this. I also asked to join the meeting to provide my observations and ensure that the seriousness is truly conveyed she can be so friendly that she downplays negative things. She was totally open to this, and agreed that she needs to push for more serious treatment, since it is truly life or death. I am usually the one who steps in when some tough pushingadvocacy needs to be done, and I am now here to step up. This has become the most important thing in my life, and I am on a search for a solution. I just want her to survive, to live a peaceful, happy life, and I want to be there with her, until we get old. I know that the psychiatrist may have the answers, but this is too serious to put our lives in a single persons hands. Im begging you to please consider this, and to please make some suggestions about treatments we should raise with the doctor, or if there are certain doctors you think we should seek out. Is electroshock therapy something we should bring up, for example? Im fighting for her life, and will do anything to save her. She wants to be better, and is open to whatever is needed.

    "I feel like my subconscious is trying to keep me depressed Lately Ive been struggling with my mental health. Its gotten to the point that I feel physically sick from it, and Im fed up. Im a person who gets stuck on details and repeating the past in my head over and over to the point that I get sick. And then the next day Ill be extremely hyper and euphoric for about 4 hours and swing immediately back into this depressive state like its my default state. I feel like no one likes me and that I have no friends, and the reason that Im in a leadership position in theatre is because my director feels bad for me. Although people tell me that thats not true I cant engrain that into my head for some reason. Part of me knows that Im being irrational and overthinking everything, but I cant stop. It feels like Im subconsciously looking for something to upset me and get me down so I can keep feeding my depression, and I hate it. I want to get better, I really really do, yet my brain wont let me. I keep making things a way bigger deals in my head than they actually should be. I keep feeling like people are out to get me when theyre not. Its like I have tow people living in my head, the depressed one is in charge, and the rational one is being held captive and out of control. Its negatively impacting my relationships.

    "This is too long and no one likes reading long shit but I just can’t take it anymore idk what to do Still screaming at each other. I am broke and cannot afford a lot of furniture so I hear EVERYTHING. They always slam shit so hard it shakes my floors and triggers my ptsd very badly, I think the person is getting abused downstairs so I had enough and finally called the police on them to file a domestic abuses complaint. I packed up my ps4 and let the cops in as I made my way out. Ive resorted to going to my parents on the weekends to avoid their slamming and fighting. Im so sick of living in a shithole and being forced to stay away from home every fucking weekend. I miss my poor cat who is my lifeline, I dont like having to leave her alone. But if I stay it triggers my manic depressive BPD and Ill just lay in silence fixating on the thumping and arguing while I contemplate suicide bc I hate my fucking situation. No one will probably read this because its so long, but Im tired of being poor. Im tired of having noisy abuso e neighbours triggering my BPD by slamming shit shaking my floors every fucking day. Im scared of going back to my apartment tomorrow because even though the cops came, nothing will change. I still live in a shithole and a never ending nightmare of being woke up to slamming. Im tired of careless people. A couple weeks ago they triggered a BPD episode to the point where I punched a hole in the wall. They love to blast music and movies with their big ass bass that shakes my floors. I wrote a letter to them begging them to stop. Nothing changed. The rental company will do nothing as always. Or theyll kick them out so crackheads will move in. No where feels safe anymore. I miss my poor baby cat who is alone at home now. Im scared to go back to my apartment tomorrow because theyll probably just keep slamming shit. I CSNT afford to move to a new place. I cant find a job.

My parents, my partner, my friends  all have that. Sometimes there are recorded sirens in the news and we mute it for a second to hear if its in our city or not. Now for the depression. I fear to travel outside my city. From both people and missiles. I fear for the future of the people in my country. Ive canceled lots of plans. Today was the first day I moved the live news broadcasting to my iPad, and powered up my xbox to clear my mind. It lasted one hour.. I dont know what to do while everything is going on other than listening to the news, stay safe, and buy foods for weeks so i wont get out of my house. If you have any idea, commentary, even support i would love reading everything you write.",
    "Any advice on working full time with depression? Ive had a job pretty consistently since I was 15, Im now 27. Ive always worked part time because it made it easier to manage my mental health. Im now in pretty desperate need of a good job and Im willing to do full time, Im just very nervous about getting burnt out fast with the typical 40 hour work week. I know so many people with mental health problems manage to do it, and I would love some advice.",
    "I'm alone. Im lost. Im afraid. Im worthless. I have no one in my life anymore, bar one friend who lives on the opposite side of the world. I lost my boyfriend yesterday. He broke up with me because my depression was bringing him down. I understand, I guess, but the last thing I could ever have wanted or needed was my boyfriend to leave me, he was my rock, and he cheered me up even on my worst days. I have no family. They never wanted much to do with me, especially when I started developing mental health issues 8 years ago. They slowly but surely made their way out of my life and upset me in the most awful ways. I have no friends. I moved into university and left my friends at home, and I really struggled to make new friends here. I have one, my flatmate, but thats it, no one else wants anything to do with me. Im even considering moving back home to a mother who really dislikes me and made my life a living hell, I cant stay here at uni. I have no one left. I have no reason to live anymore. Ive fought for so long, and surprisingly, I think I can say Im currently at the lowest part of my life, and I have gone through and done a tonne of shit. I dont know what to do anymore.",
    "Depression after my scoliosis surgery Hello everyone, Ive had a surgery on 10th of February, since my scoliosis reached about 60. I was happy I was getting the surgery at first, seeing it as an investment in the future. Without it, I would have experienced extreme pain in later stages of my life. However, after i woke up from the surgery Ive been hit with nightmarish pain, unable to sleep for almost two days. Since then, Ive been worried if I have made the right decision. Hearing nurses say that people are recovering after just three days got me really sad, as i can barely move around in my bed without major pain. Im feeling really desperate, as if there is no escaping from the pain, as I feel plenty of it even under hospital medications. I had a friend that underwent the very same surgery, i looked up to her as she was able to live easily with it, as if she never was on a surgery. Unfortunately, I fucked up our friendship because I was a dick. I greatly regret it since now i see what she had to go through and how strong she was. Now I have no one to reach out too about this. If someone has any experience with a scoliosis surgery or can help, please do Thank you",
    "I'm a recovering alcoholic with Severe Depression I started drinking about 8 years ago, and Ive been sober for 2 years. Within those 6 years, I went from casually drinking, to drinking a fifth of Vodka a day. It got so bad that if I went without alcohol for a day I would start to have withdrawals. I pawned a lot of my stuff just for alcohol. I destroyed my relationship with my son and his mom. I did a lot of things in that time that I wouldnt ever do today. I look back on it and wonder why I even acted the way I did. I was a complete asshole. Fast forward to today, and Im still dealing with a lot of issues. I cant function like a normal human being. Ive withdrawn myself from almost everyone. I have no desire to go out and make friends or have fun. Not that I care to have a social life I just figured Id throw it in there for context. I cant forgive myself for a lot of the things Ive done. I dont know how to. Ive spent so long punishing myself I dont know how to forgive myself. I want to get better. I want to be happy and have a stable relationship with my son again. I just dont even know where to start. Ive tried talking to a therapist before but I didnt really like talking to someone I dont know about my life. I dont like talking to anyone about my feelings. I dont know what else to say. Just started speaking from my mind for a minute. I dont do it often and what better place than here. P. S. Im atheist so I dont think religion is going to help me with this. If you made it to the end I appreciate your time. I hope you have a wonderful dayevening.",
    "i’m so sick of this shit (rant) 34yo female here. ive had major clinical depression for most of my life. im medicated. i do everything i can to keep on top of it. but it just comes back whenever it wants without any warning and knocks me out. im not suicidal BUT sometimes its so overwhelming to know that this is going to happen at random times for the rest of my life. its so exhausting. it makes me realize how tough people with depression are for fighting this off ALWAYS. but im struggling. i live alone. i have my animals thank god but i have no choice but to work. i cant take time off because i need to pay my mortgage. my friends are understanding but dont really get it. one friend just suggested i plan a fun birthday party to take my mind off of it and it honestly made me more depressed. then i felt selfish. i dont want to randomly text my friends who are busy with their kids, jobs, etc just to say i need help because it feels like a burden. no matter how many times they say its not. i just feel like they say that and then roll their eyes to themselves like oh here she goes again. i have no reason to be depressed i have a great job, home, family, friends, etc but my mind just goes insane and i suddenly cant do anything. i cant shower, barely feed myself, and just do the minimum amount of work to get by. i dont even know what im looking for. i guess just people who also feel like this. like  numb. youre not crying or angry. youre just sitting there waiting for the day to end. ive been dealing with this for 25 years and im OVER IT. i just wish i at least had a warning when it was coming back. ill be on top of the world for weeks or months and then all of a sudden, the grounds knocked out from under me and i have no control over it whatsoever. then the guilt sets in i should be cleaning my house. i should shower i should be working etc. idk im just so fed up. not suicidal.",
    "A therapist doesn’t want to see me because I have trauma. What the fuck. I feel so confused. I had a consultation with a potential new psychotherapist yesterday, to which she told me we should both take 24 hours to think amp see if were both a good fit, to which I was fine with even though I already had my mind made up based off of the description of servicesexpertise she had listed on her website. After the 24 hrs passed, I havent heard back from her, so I emailed her following up about our session, and stated Im confident with moving forward with them, just for her to email me back basically stating that she doesnt feel shes a good fit for me since I have CPTSD, and how shes still an intern, meanwhile she CLEARLY states all of her credentials, some mentioning acute AND complex trauma! Along with helping marginalized communitiesLGBTQ. I should note Ive seen two other counselors at this practice, but unfortunately cant see them due to changes in insurance. They were the ones who referred me to this therapist. I feel so alone and its been SO difficult finding help. This was a kick in the gut for me.",

    "Please help, i am so tired Can someone please explain? So i dated this guy one year ago. He became severely depressed and we kept texting when he felt like it. He doesnt really talk to me about it because he doesnt want to burden me its annoying. He is seeing a therapist once a week and is taking all kinds of medication. I made him a christmas package. With gifts, food, and a selfmade depression journal see my other post. And i cant wait to cheer him up with it. I texted him last Thursday if i could bring it. He seemed happy about it and we agreed to meet that evening. But then he texts me last minute saying his best friend is at his place and he forgot they were going to have diner together. He then gave me all kinds of new options, and I then asked if today was okay, but i still didnt get a text back... it has been 3 days I dont know what to do anymore. Should i send him another text? Ugh I am trying to support him but he keeps letting me down every time. He is with his best friend literally every second of the day, it seems like he cant be alone. But he also seems to be unable to text me back? I dont understand. I really dont. I read books, i talked to you guys, and i educated myself about depression, but i am so tired. Can somebody please try to explain? I dont even know what i should do with the christmas box anymore... advice is really appreciated",

    "Every night just before drifting off to sleep, I'm overwhelmed with feelings of self hate and guilt. Im a seasoned pro in dealing with depression but this is getting out of hand. It used to happen every once in a while, but now its consistent every night. As I lay here with my eyes closed and I begin to dream, suddenly I realize Im a horrible employee and Im on the verge of losing my job. Or Im a horrible father and my son deserves better. Or Im a horrible husband who should have let someone better marry my wife and make her happy. Or I suddenly realize my finances are messed up for someone my age. Or I feel like Im the worst kind of friend. The tremendous feeling of guilt is absolutely overwhelming and I wake up and have to often times sit up, my heart pounding like crazy. The house is a mess, Ive been working on the same task too long at work and theyre going to find out Im a fraud, I have a ton of yard work I need to do and the neighbors think Im a total slob, my son doesnt feel loved and needs better things in life. The list expands exponentially if I let it, even as I type it out its flowing in like a river of crippling worry, my face is completely bloodshot like Im embarrassed, and I cant catch my breath. All I want to do is go on facebook and tell everyone how sorry I am for being so embarrassing. Or go sit at my desk and work more so I have more to report on in the standup. Or go lay with my 4 year old son and tell him how proud of him I am and how great his Lego creation tonight was. Or clean and organize the whole house so my wife wakes up and feels good about being married to me. I get this frantic feeling like it all needs to happen, but its too late, the day is over, and I messed up again. I did not feel this way an hour ago when I laid down in my bed. It spikes in me just before drifting off to sleep, like I was watching my life in a movie but then I suddenly realize its real and I am overcome with fear, dread, embarrassment, and guilt, like Im driving a train off a bridge or something.",
    "I want to open up. I need to open up about this to someone, something, I dont give a fuck if its just a reddit page. Im depressed. Im seeing some therapist, which I dont find very good. I cant trust her. She tries to put me on medication, I dont want that and ive made it clear. I dont wanna kill my brain cells. thats what I feel antidepressants do, I tried some a few years back and it made me a zombie. Ive had some other therapy in the past, some of which were good and some were completely shit. I drink to numb emotions. I dont even like to drink with other people, I enjoy drinking alone till I pass out. I dont drunk text, drunk call or usually do anything stupid while drunk. I do it 34 times a week. Its the only thing that helps me numb this constant pain and regret of being alive. Its been going on for 2 years. I cant give up that habit. The constant theme in my life is that I cant run away from my emotions. Ive tried living in different countries, fitting in with different kind of people, anything that would like... get me settled down. I dont feel like I fit in anywhere. I dont think I need to feel like Ive made to someone or that like theres someone that would make me feel special. I think I just wanna fit in, somewhere, anywhere, howevere. To find  not really my people  but my place. Anywhere Ive gone, I get this feeling of new start, burying these old feelings of shame and not fitting in. And they just come back to me after a while.

    "How do I fight again numbness and guilt? Im 21f and I have had a terrible year so far, in which my depression has reached levels Ive never imagined. I have had this feeling for a few weeks now. I wake up every day knowing it will be the same. I feel like a bag of meat, just hovering around the house doing things on autopilot. I dont eat much, cause my family is going through a very though situation so theres not much to eat. Im in college and I get stuff to do all the time. Ive been a very good student so far, but lately, Ive barely had the energy to check on my assignments... I feel terrible for not putting much effort anymore, because this might be probably the only way I can help my family in the future. I cant sit on my desk and get things done bc my arms feel heavy and my head empty. I thought that maybe getting a new job would help me getting my life together and distract me from everything that happens at home, so I applied for part time tele marketing jobs, but dont receive any call backs. My teaching job is very unstable so I decided to step back because it was taking more than it was giving me... I feel the constant need to cry and just curl up in my chair and stay there forever.

I just wanted to get some stuff off my chest and maybe reach out to some people for advice on how to handle this issue. I feel like everything I see or is recommended to me across all media is something depressing and political and its like a hammer beating me over the head constantly. I honestly cant take it anymore. Whether its watching tv, browsing Reddit, at work, even hanging out with friends playing tabletop I feel trapped and that I cant escape. I just dont care and I never have nor will. Im already an easily annoyed person. Its gotten to the point where Id rather sit in my room drawing by myself or writing than interact with anyone because inevitably something politically charged will come up and more than likely make the situation awkward at best and outright hostile at worse. Even telling someone I dont care about their politics is taken as a personal attack and I get blasted for being ignorant. Its definitely hampering my willingness to interact with the world and my mental health. Tldr how do I avoid being constantly exposed to depressing negative politics and people who are so consumed by it that they throw away any sort of human dignity? I need help. P.

    "How to deal with the cyclical triad of draining symptoms Over the past months my depression has progressively become more disruptive. Im now to the point where Im stuck in a cycle of anxiety during the day, insomnia at night, and anhedonia all throughout the day. Its definitely affected my work as I know and feel Im not as efficient and poignant as I used to be, and I fear that Ill lose my job due to lackluster work. Outside of increasing my SSRI dose with my doc, how can I overcome this if I cant find therapy right now due to pandemic? Much of my depression I feel comes from loneliness. Im a man in my late 20s and Ive never had a true best friend or romantic partner. I hoped this year would be that year because I found a job in a city I wanted to live, and it felt like a chance at renewed life. I accepted before the shutdown, and started after restrictions were in place, so Ive spent the entire year alone in a new city as all social avenues were cut off. I almost have no socialization with coworkers either due to working remotely.

    "I have a problem with getting mental help. My parents are a bit off. If their friend or a family member needs help, they will put their entire life on hold. But if their kids need help, its rarely done. Ive tried for months to get them to make a few doctors appointments. Specifically my psychiatrist. But no matter how many times I ask, it never gets done. In fact, about six months ago, I went to the dentist to get some cavities filled. I had cavities on the top and bottom sets, so, they said that we would have to come to two separate appointments to properly get them filled. Well, we went for the top set, and Ive asked my parents to schedule the second appointment ever since. However, my main concern is going to a psychiatrist. Mainly because for about two and a half years now, Ive had problems with the way my brain functions, and my grasp on reality. I just havent felt right. But in that time, I never considered going to a psychiatrist because i had been to one before, and they did prescribe me medication, so I thought that if there was something wrong, they would have found it years prior. But i spoke with some friends about it and they told me it would be smart to go back. That was a few months ago and I havent been able to convince my parents that I should go back. Its not a financial issue, my insurance covers everything And its not a time issue, neither of my parents are working. My parents are the There aint nothing you cant fix yourself type, and dont understand much about mental help. Its getting so bad that my mother wont hardly talk to anyone because shes either too lazy, to too buried in some kind of device to do anything. Then, when I ask my aunt or grandparents for help, my parents get pissed and complain about how I make them look bad. Dont get it wrong though, they are great in most other regards, but when it comes to me actually needing help, they really dont do much. When it comes to real responsibilities, they are just all around lazy. If anything cant be solved within a minute or two, they wont hardly even look in its direction.",

Was because they are doing diversity hiring and couldnt fit a white person into their principal lineup? Was it because Im a military veteran, and someone looked me up to make a stink about it? Was it because I have trouble getting social media followers? Was it because Im autistic? ANSWER ME GOD DAMNIT! This isnt about how I feel, this is about what these people are doing to me, and I want to know why they are doing it to me after I have earned my place!

Ive posted my audition results from every company to whom Ive submitted this audition season, to show you that telling me not to give up isnt changing their decision to reject me!

I want these companies to relay to me exactly why they rejected me so that I can improve, Or else I want them to change their decisions, So that not giving up becomes a reality for me as much as it does for anybody else you tell it to!!!",

    "26. Depressed, socially anxious, lost and suicidal. A big part of my brain focuses on high school and that fact that I pretty much did nothing during it besides smoke weed and drink. I had freinds but I feel like they werent genuine freinds, just other people who enjoyed partying like i did. Most of the summers I spent alone sitting at home. It was like that in middle school too. I remember joking to a kid on the bus in middle school, telling him I go home and stare at my wall for hours then i go to school. I never had a girlfriend in high school  just a few hook ups. I regret not joining the track team multiple people said i shouldve, I was really fast. I wish I had an intimate relationship in highschool. I was always pretty smart but I really just stopped caring about my grades at the start of freshman year. I had a lot of angst and spite against my parents and I attribute that to why I stopped giving a shit. Pretty much all i thought and cared about in high school was smoking weed. I shouldve been focused more on joining a club and my grades. Although marijuana was a huge escape that I initially loved I feel like it was one of the worst choices I made because it only made me more introverted. It also made okay with the fact that i was doing nothing with my life and not thinking about my future. I had one job as a bus boy which i quit after about 2 months. I graduated high school as a below average student wirh absolutely no clue what I wanted to do in college. I went to a community college for a month before dropping out. While there I felt extremely out of my element, only talked to fellow freinds from high school who also went there, and made zero new friends because of my social anxiety. After dropping out my life as an extreme recluse began. I worked but it was with my dad doing roofing and home improvement type work. I only hung out with one friend from high school and going to his house and getting drunk with his family at their house parties was the extent of my social life during this time. I spent most of the money I made with my dad on weed.",
    "Still on the fence For a long while now I have been depressed and havent really had many close friend and for a little bit hitting a point of literally just 1 semi close online friend and no body else at all, but thats besides the point. For the last probably month or 2 I have been on the fence or just cant decide on what to do with one side being just live a happy life with a tightly knit group of girl and maybe online friends with possibly even a relationship and the other side being suicide. For the longest time Ive been leaning back and forth and thanks to friends Im feeling better some time but thanks to school and alot of punishments and groundings every so often and fairly recently having moved between states pushing me the other way. Im not sure if this is just me or amazingly common but I just dont know what to do any more and I want to be able to land on the right side of the fence on my feet and not fall back into a pit sorry if its an odd analogy. I just really dont know what to do since the only people who ever really reach out to me are semi close friends and just some school mates ending nonsense. All I do if sit around mostly unmotivated to make a difference and better things for myself by simple even doing homework but instead I feel like a lazy bum who uses his only bit of motivation to ask a handful of friends how their day was when I see them only but still feel like Im just pestering them. I mean its been almost half the school year now and the only person who sits next to me because they want to and not because their entire group moved to where I sit is my semi close friend I mention earlier. Ive got nearly no friends, got near nonexistant privacy, no motivation, and the only 2 things that I can always look back on for a reason to keep going are Im my dad only child and he put 15 years of effort into making my last this long and just the simple question of how can I do it quick without it hurting too much or looking a fool.",

    "I’m lonely and depressed So I was off on a youth volunteer program, located across the country. We would have been traveling to a second place, which didnt happen. I was in a house with 10 youth from around Canada, who started off as strangers. We were living together for 2 12 months before we were sent home, which was halfway through the programme. I met some of my best friends. We have plans in over a year to do a road trip across the country. But I wont see them until then, as we live so far apart from each other. I loved the time we all had together. There were ups and downs, but I got a lot from the experience. Im generally quite shy, so it was amazing to be surrounded by people, socializing 247. I definitely came out of my shell. We would stay up late, and all sleep in the same room. We would wake up, and have breakfast together. Anytime I felt like going out for a walk, I always had friends around to join me. We smoked weed many nights together, watched movies, and made food late at night. It was what I always felt like I was missing, not having any siblings who I had this relationship with. Anytime I was feeling a bit off, my friends were there to talk to me about it. Also, I was independent. I could do what I wanted and be who I wanted to be. I wasnt being told by my parents how to behave, or being judged by a group of friends from home who I act a certain way around. I came into the programme as myself, and only myself. I didnt have to act a certain way to fit in with a group of friends, or act a certain way at home to please my parents. Dont get me wrong, I love my parents. But Im at the time of my life 17M, btw where I want that freedom. I want to explore who I can be. We were supposed to travel other places, and fly to a different part of the country to spend the second half of the trip. Then we got quarantined. Then we were sent home.",
    "Therapist won’t give meds Im a minor with the NHS in the UK. CAMHS. Youre probably thinking that there must be a reason, no. Im this close to ending it all and my therapist will just refuse to let me see the psychiatrist no matter how many times I ask. If I do attempt it will be successful, so its not like Ill have multiple attempts ie. they may give me meds after one. What do I say to get them to think more about giving me them? Theyre so reluctant. I see people complain 247 about how they dish out meds on a platter. But its the opposite for me and there is absolutely no reason. Ive done my research and I know the side affects. But no therapy will work now.",
    "Please Help: Spontaneous Suicide Attempts - 25 y/o Female My wife 25 year old female whom Ive been with for 8 years, recently attempted taking her own life for the third time. I was lucky enough to notice something was up, and prevent the act. When she isnt in a depressed state, she is smiley, friendly and she even manages to excel as a grad student at a top school. She has been battling with bouts of severe depression and suicidal ideation for her entire life. These depressive episodes never seem to correspond to events, but come on spontaneously. I think its also worth noting that her biological aunt committed suicide when she was in her 30s and it was also unexpected and didnt seem to be related to any specific occurance. The first time my wife attempted suicide was in college. A friend called 911 and she was briefly evaluated at the ER and then released I think she lied about her real feelings. A few years later, she suddenly told me one day that she felt she needed to be admitted immediately for her own safety, and I drove her to the hospital where she voluntarily was admitted for about a week, and was finally set up with a psychiatrist. This is where things got a little bit better for awhile the psychiatrist prescribed some medications that really seemed to help, a lot. She seemed to get down less frequently, and she said that her depression was more mild and less frequent. She also said that the voice that tells her to harm herself was far less common. Her medications have been adjusted a bit over the course of a couple years Ive included the current medication regimen below, but unfortunately things are still far from alright. While her depressive episodes seem to be less common, she still has occasional, spontaneous serious suicidal ideation. Recently, she made an attempt in the middle of the afternoon that I was able to stop, and by that night she was smiley, laughing and back to her normal self. This latest attempt has made me realize that we are not out of the woods, and she needs more aggressiveserious care if she is going to survive. I asked her if she was fully honest with her psychiatrist about her suicide attempts and her ideation, and she admitted that she has downplayed it.",
    "I’ve had a rlly good last few days even today is fine so why do I feel so depressed? Sure there are definitely some things Id change if I could. But Im pretty sure I cant sooo why let it brother me? I push myself through the days but Im just not happy. Im depressed and havent felt this for awhile. I miss how I use to feel. I just let something get a hold of me and now its hard to shake it off. Im not sure if its correlated with the pinching chest pain Ive been having as well. I see its affecting a few of my highly valued relationship and my health. Anyone have any tried and true healthy tricks to distract themselves from this feeling?

    "I am really struggling with people touching me Ive been having a pretty rough two or three months. This means even that I feel uncomfortable having my boyfriend touching me. I have talked to him about this twice how Ive been growing distant and disliking anything to do with touching he is a person who loves touch. It seems like even though Ive told him how bad it feels having someone touching me, he keeps doing it and it is starting to suffocate me. He is always asking why I dont touch him and stopping me to hug me or touch me in some way. This is making me quite irritable as well. I am waiting to get help from a doctor and see what I can do about it, but can you guys give me some advice on this? How can I get myself to not feel this way?

I swore growing up working with my dad that Id never end up here. Somehow, some way Id find some way to make a living and support myself in some way that involved more mental work and air conditioning. I always thought Id be a writer, but since about 25 when I had a mental health crisis Ive had no inspiration barely the aspiration to remain alive for a long time, I just existed very depressed, in no small part because I was doing this same work. I have a college degree, but its a bachelors in Culinary Arts. Essentially its useless as anything but wall art, but it was important to me to finish college regardless of how depressed I was. The program gave me an easy couple semesters when I couldnt stand being. I always thought some inspiration would hit, or some brick would fall onto my head and Id see clearly what I should do with my life. I remember tearful prayers at 14, asking God for some kind of guidance that never came. I didnt know then and I dont know now what Im going to do when I grow up  35, in case you forgot. How do you find a path forward? How does one acquire inspirationpassion? There will to live?",

    "I really need some advice to fix my life.. My social skills were and still are very poor so talking to people thru social media made it easier for me to communicate with others and make some friends so thats what i did and because of that i found some amazing people that i had lots of fun with and kept me distracted from my real life problems. Some of them were momentary but some i still talk to even till this day. My whole life i had to endure family drama from both sides of the family and i had to solve every single problem i had by myself cause i did not want to bring up more problems to my family so i had to mature pretty early on in my life. Fast forward to now i have lost 2 school years because of absences i dont have any REAL friends that i can count on and no one to talk to i spend my whole day in my room with nothing to do, i dont even sit on my computer anymore i just lie on my bed sleeping or thinking,crying. I am working on losing my weight and thankfully that goes pretty well but i still feel like shit and i find no motivation to keep trying or even living. I am very self conscious about my weight and i hate the way i look regardless of the weight, oftentimes i hate myself and i am disgusteddisappointed with what Ive become.. every day that passes these feelings get stronger and stronger i dont know what to do. Now that you know a little bit about me i want to ask for advice because i have no idea what to do or where to start on fixing things.. I feel like i lost interest in everything and i feel like I dont want to live anymore..i feel alone, lost and that no one likesloves me for who i am and those who do do it out of pity or just do it because i am a family member, i dont have anyone close to me that i can talk to because the only close real friend i had started avoiding me and i dont really blame him for that. I am ready to make a change because i want strength to be able to support the people i love and if i dont make a change i fear that even more negative thoughts will get in my head like self harm or worse.",

    "Everybody seems to be “adulting” so well. I feel like I’m the only one who can’t cope. Hey everyone, I would like to apologize in advance for the long post. And, thank you for taking the time to read my post. My high school experience wasnt so amazing. I was depressed about 60 of the time. Nevertheless, I was a decent student. I tried many things. I was in the choir club, swimming club, netball club and music band. I didnt particularly feel passionate about my extracurricular activities but I was interested enough to keep pursuing them. Same with my subjects, I did my best and tried to achieve good grades. I was good at art and languages. Once again, I was not passionate about them. In fact, I hated art because I felt the heavy work load sucked the fun out of the subject. Math and science were my weakest subjects. I tried so hard to excel at them but in the end I couldnt cope. I was emotionally drained, burned out and gave up. My final grade for these two wasnt so amazing, as expected. Nevertheless, I passed. When I left high school I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. I knew I was expected to go to college, but I had no idea what I wanted to study. My mom expected me to either become a doctor, accountant or lawyer but, as my math and science grades suggested, that was never gonna happen. In the end I decided to abandon the norm and follow my passion. My passion, being fashion design, was my worst nightmare in college. I regret not listening to my gut and leaving. But I was too caught up in not wanting to disappoint my parents and, I had no clue what I would have done had I left. So, I stayed. And there began the downward spiral. I spent the next two years of my degree, confused and depressed. I couldnt cope in my final year and at one point, tried to commit suicide no one knows about this incident. In the end I failed a module only to repeat and pass it the following year.",

    "I followed the plan, and everything sucks. So, I was a good kid, got good grades, went to uni, graduated with a good degree, met a good man, married, and had kids. I fell out of love with my chosen career, and so bounced from job to job before my husband and I decided I would stay at home with the kids. Since then, weve moved far away from our friends and family  for husbands work, and I do like living here  but I have lost almost all my friends, and since my parents died, no one in my family really talks to me any more. My kids were never much involved in any school activities, so I never made friends with other moms. Our neighbors never seem to leave their homes. When my youngest graduated, I decided I wanted to go back to work. My health threw me a roadblock or two, so I didnt really start looking until February. I reworked my CVresume, and began applying. Nothing. A few years ago, my husband started what might be called a midlife crisis. He wants to open our marriage, and while we tabled these discussions because of things were dealing with, including financial struggles, he has started bringing it up again. So, I basically dont have a family, have very few friends, my health isnt great, I dont have the money to fixreplacebuy things that are needed, cant get a call  let alone an interview  for a job, and my husband  who has been my rock up until now  is angry and resentful because I dont want to talk about opening our marriage right now. I followed the plan, and now I hate my life. Getting a job would help so much, but my degree is old and my experience is old, and no one wants me. I feel useless and awful. These are office jobs husband and I agreed other jobs would not work because of health issues mostly, lower pay secondly. I have no one to talk to  friends arent that close family dead or wont talk to me cant afford therapy  so I am venting here. If anyone read this far, thank you.",

    "Advice and help please TLDR Im underage, depressed and dont want to involve my parents in this. I dont have any friend support right now either. Not sure what to do now and feel like just giving up. Im 17 this year and went for a free mental health checkup a few days ago parental consent and knowledge not needed which confirmed that I suffer from Major Depressive Disorder. Ive been feeling the symptoms for a little over a year now and attempted suicide a few months ago. Now that I have confirmed that I have depression, Im not sure what to do next. They recommended that I look into getting a psychiatrist and psychologist for medicine and counseling respectively, especially since my family has a history of depression. However, since Im underage, I need parental consent. Im not close to either of my parents or any of my siblings and I have quite a lot of bad memories from my childhood as well. Additionally, my father has quite a negative perception of depression which definitely would not help. My younger brother has had suicidal ideation for the past year as well his school found out and told my parents so my mom in particular is very concerned about him. I dont want to burden them further or open up to them about this at all, and since my brother is not mentally well either, I feel that my parents should focus more on him. At the moment, none of my friends know about this diagnosis and I dont intend to tell any of them either. I pushed away my two closest friends a few months ago and I dont trust anyone enough to tell them either. Even if I did, I dont think they would be able to help much ranting does not help me much and just makes me feel like a burden. Im pretty much completely alone now and have no clue what to do. It feels like my only option is to tell my parents even though I really dont want to and they may react very negatively. Also, Im very tempted to just let this get worse and worse until I eventually kill myself so that hampers any attempts to get better as well. Any advice if possible?",
    "I'm so tired I ran out of therapy appointments, it didnt really help anyways and my therapist never really gave me any methods to feel better instead of just trying to do things more. I got swarmed with homework again, having to finish two full art projects and some other things I forgot, but my family was going on a trip over the weekend at this point I stopped fighting over quarantining it was clear they didnt listen to my concerns so I wouldnt be able to work on it much. Everything just built up to this point where something as relatively small as having to finish a project just made me snap. The night before the trip I just freaked out, I was a mess of tears and slamming stuff around my room while packing. I remember cutting my finger, I dont know why its just what I went too, I felt awful after it, it hurt a lot and while it calmed me down I just felt so embarassed and ashamed that I did it. That weekend everytime my finger brushed against something even slightly I just got reminded of what I did to myself, it was horrible. Sometime after or before, I have no idea really, something similar happened. I didnt do a couple of random spanish assignments in school and those appearently counted as quizes without us being told, causing my grade to drop to a solid 30 or 40. Again this was a pretty small problem that was cleared up shortly after but things built up so much that something like this was a breaking point. The night before a big spanish test that would either save or ruin my grade, I was completely overwhelmed again and just broke down, my mom was annoyed I was making noise that late and she kind of just aggressively told me to calm down a bunch but it only got worse. It just all felt so hopeless, but it was the first time in a while that I felt grounded in a way, that I ws actually there presently instead of just going through the motions, but the whole situation hurt. These downward spirals never really got better. Those were the worst examples but the time in between those was filled with me feeling a crushing sense of hopelessness and exhaustion constantly. I was tired of it all, I was overwhelmed to the point where small mishaps with homework could break me.",

    "Does anyone struggle with figuring out whether you're depressed or just struggling?? And pulling yourself out of a deep depression? TW! Lifes not going good for me and Im realizing now that I may have been in a deep depression and not even realized it. Ive been depressed before and realized it but this seems different. Ive had good days and bad days but everyday it seems like I always drop to a deep low everyday. Idk if Im depressed or just over thinking it. I cant get myself to be happy. Ill find little moments of joy and some days Im in a really good mood but then always seem to drop down. Like Ill be having a good day and then it feels like the floor crumbled under me and now Im so low that I cant see light. I just dont feel good. Ive put up these many walls to keep emotions and feelings away because of my new job, home responsibilities and marriage responsibilities. Ive pent up so much that I cant even seem to cry. Ive tried but after like minute it just shuts off. Like I cant get myself to cry. Im at a lose and dont know what to do. I keep telling myself things will turn out OK but I just want to stop existing. Like I dont necessarily want to die but I also dont want to live. And this has been a consistent for months. I feel like Ive been in a deep depression and I cant seem to pull myself out. But again idk. How do I tell when I am and how do I pull myself out? Can anyone please help?...",
    "Why do I feel so shitty Yeah I post here like everyday, I cant get myself to do any of the things I say Ill do. I feel like Ive done everything I could do at this point, so why do I feel so shitty? I feel so tired and emptyheaded even though I really need to start on a paper for school. I just cant make myself get up to do it, I feel like I cant even start bc I am so weighed down by my own thoughts. I feel ugly, useless and I wish I could just get over that, learn to accept it in the back of my mind as something I cant change so I could actually do shit. I dont know what else I can do. Going to try to email my dr tomorrow, but I guess I wont if I dont get a good start on this paper bc Im spending so much money on college, literally cant afford to not do my best or get a shitty grade. I eat healthy everyday, try to lose weight but of course its very slow, but I just feel like I just sit around and rot and I dont know how to get out of that. Thank you for reading or any advice, I really will try to take it but again I just feel like its impossible to get myself to do things that arent immediately easy. I really do try not to be lazy and useless, I dont know why its not working out.",
    "Lost motivation, want to quit... please help Because I want to help people but this isnt the way I envisionwant myself to be when I graduate. amp Ive realized over the years that there are so many other ways to help people besides the conventional path glorified by Asian society of becoming a doctor amp saving lives which is limited by manpower amp the time crunch amp bureaucracy so in the end, how much can you really help?. Ive tried seeking mental health help from a psychiatrist amp was diagnosed with dysthymia  panic attacks, but the meds dont help as my symptoms are precipitated by the med school environment amp its associated stress. Ive contemplated quitting med school but Im trapped by the bonddebt. Ive considered talking to my school about my struggles but... lets just say that the way doctors talk about mental health behind patients backs doesnt paint a very encouraging picture for me to open up to them. Ive even expressed my thoughts on leaving medicine to my parents amp while they are understanding amp came around after a tearful session of confessions amp explanations, they dont quite get the amount of mental pain Im in amp keep advising me to at least complete school amp get my medical degree before leaving. I know that logically, this is the wisest option as theres only about 1 more year to go... but emotionally amp psychology, Im at a loss as to how to get through 12 more months packed with lessons amp ward rounds amp performance assessments amp two more big exams.

    "I'm ruining my own life but I can't stop. Im 20 and in my junior year of college. I was rediagnosed this year with dysthymia used to be major depression and started Prozac, which basically just gave me mild side effects and didnt help at all. I switched to Wellbutrin and didnt even have any side effects, I felt like I was taking a sugar pill in the morning because it also didnt help at all. I start Effexor tomorrow and am setting up counseling, but Im literally ruining my life right now. In past semesters, I was able to scrape through with a B average and go to most of my classes. Thats not the case anymore. Im not getting out of bed until the sun goes down, Im skipping days of classes at a time, I have no idea what any of my grades are  and the worst part is that I cant even bring myself to care. Somewhere in the back of my mind I KNOW that if I fail this semester Im going to majorly fuck up my financial aid and wont graduate on time, but it just doesnt matter to me. Im too tired to care. I barely wake up in time for work most days, and Im having to make excuses for being late all the time. I dont cook, so I dont eat. I dont clean, so my room and kitchen are disgusting. I dont even know what homework assignments I need to catch up on. Im exhausted all the time. Im too tired to even read over this before posting, so sorry in advance if none of it makes sense. Basically Im halfway through this semester and Im pretty sure Im going to fail all of my classes, ruin my financial aid, get fired from my job, get written up by housing I live on campus, and Im worried about what I might do to myself if this all happens. I dont know what Im supposed to do. I dont know how to make myself care. I dont know how to get motivated to get out of bed in the morning. I will accept literally any advice from anyone.

Tired of the way things work to as soon as something good comes along it ends fast. Nothing even helps me tried doing everything in the book. Ive got treatment resistant depression so literally if a med helps which they usually dont they help for a month and then stop working.

    "My suicidal long-distance friend often does not respond to me for days and idk what to think about it, how can I help her? So a few months ago I befriended a girl which whom I have a connection like with no one else. Unfortunately her mental health has been declining recently, she had a suicide attempt. I am extremely worried for her, last time we talked she told me I dont have to worry for her because she doesnt have the means to commit suicide, but its still extremely worrying. I told her that I want to meet her, that I can come in a few months. I texted her everyday but since a few weeks she rarely views my messages leaving them unread, despite her being online. She says that its from anxiety and brain fog and I want to believe her, because being ignored is something I really dont like. That also of course makes me worried for her as fuck. I guess that calling her would probably be rude and will cause her discomfort? I dont know if I can do anything for her? I wanted to support her with talking to her but right now I cant even do that. I dont have any contact to her family, and contacting them would probably make her upset. She has a long distance boyfriend but he is also kinda shady as he is a source of her depression and he often ignores my messages too. Any advice wiil be appreciated",
    "Saw a therapist today ... what’s next? Today I finally saw a therapist to figure out why Ive lost my zest for everything in life. Job. Hobbies.

Our next appointment is for the 22nd, at which point we will address treatment. I want to learn how to help myself. I was happy before and believe I can be again. But I dont want to wait 13 days to start. I want to start making steps towards progress now. What are some small things I can do that youve found successful in the past to get yourself up and moving again? Do I force myself to go to the gym X times a week? Make appointments with myself? What about socialization? Anything small will do. Im just so happy to know theres a community on Reddit fighting the same battles I thought I was alone in. Cheers",

    "Morning disgust Hello there. Been diagnosed with severe depression two years ago. Now i got rid of medications, and there has been no problem for month or two. School started and I noticed how often i would get sick due to weather change. I also started to be more nervous in open spaces, even at home. But the worst thing that came back are the mornings... each day, in early hours, I would wake up, with sudden... disgust? I dont know how to explain it... basically the thought of getting up is terrifying. It feels like torture. Whenever i would think of something positive, my brain would deny it, or even worse, make my positive thoughts negative. Telling me i am all alone, that this is forever, and that I am a bad person for not doing anything about it. I know i am very sensitive person, But i havenť seen anyone so terrified by this. People would judge me and tell me that its my duty to go to school. They would start explaining it to me like I am some stupid outcast who thinks he can do whatever he wants. I know that i canť, but this issue is stopping me from doing so. Now that its back... I am terrified more than ever. It is easier to overcome it by getting up with no thought, but it is still hard and life consuming. I dont know what to do, have you ever experienced something like this?",

    "Do people actually care? Sorry for the title, but it really is the best way to put it. Everyone says they care about me, want me to live, to message them if I ever feel like doing it. But Ive noticed a pattern, those same people talk about me behind my back, those same people often want me alive, but not necessarily around. My question is this, am I right to think that people as a whole are a lot more fake and cold than theyre willing to admit? Because I see a lot of words being said but Ive yet to meet someone who I actually believe cares. This post may seem self centered but I ask it out of frustration, I try my best to fight through it, for others. To be there for others. To care for others. Yet I struggle to find evidence of reciprocation besides empty words. The only reason Im alive today is because I promised I wouldnt hurt those around me by doing it, but Im feeling like they wouldnt actually care?

    "I don't know what to do I just graduated from high school recently and I thought that would help with all my anxiety but Im just sitting in my room feeling lifeless. I dont sleep or eat regularly, and I barely know the time. The past 5 years have been really difficult for me, and Ive only had 2 people to talk to, one being a school counsellor. I think they just prolonged whatever I have but nothing really helps. I stopped having constant suicidal thoughts since 3 months ago, but it was so sudden and I just feel this lethargic tiredness always lurking. I dont know if its residual or its because everythings physically taking a toll on me. Even when everything I thought was giving me stress was over, nothing changed. And I have been trying to go out and meet my friends. Ive been out of my house more these days than most of my life combined. I thought whatever I was feeling might have been situational but I dont think it is. Ive tried swallowing pills a bunch of times and hurting myself and nothing happened, so I took that as a sign to try to be more healthy, but its not really working. I felt completely fine and then a few weeks ago I took 24 colored pills and thought maybe something would happen, and I just ended up with nausea and a stomach ache. Thats not normal, is it? I even took cough syrup with it. I dont get how nothing can happen, and I really dont get why Im still doing these things when Im not under stress which is usually the only reason I would hurt myself when it all started. I cant meet a paid professional because my parents wouldnt ever believe me. Theyre not bad people but theyre ignorant and misguided, and that mental illnesses only exist for people with real trauma. Theyd say I was lying or faking it. And believe me, Ive tried approaching the topic with them. I had 2 panic attacks in front of them and they still wouldnt let me meet a mental health counsellor even when we went to the hospital and the doctor recommended it. Whats wrong with me?

    "I suffer from persistent depression and my GF wants to leave me. Last night she told me she did not see a future for us in that way. My sombreness, some of my anxiety fueled behaviour and display of a victim mentality hurt her and have crossed certain boundaries. She meant to tell me this before, even left some breadcrumbs via text. I only noticed her pulling away, losing interest or giving me the silent treatment. I could have guessed this was on her mind but maybe I was to scared to have a talk. I feel sad that she has been dealing with this for a while and how difficult that must have been. She told me that shed given me the benefit of the doubt a couple of weeks ago but never mentioned this to me like so. I do feel her way of going about this, her communication could have been better. But then again this must have been difficult and she told me that it felt like abandoning me. I am so caught up in my current mental state that I have trouble going about things. Like litterarly doing anything some days or going somewhere on time is hard, and I hate that!

She recognises this is my situation and that I am not the guy she fell in love with right now. She needs some time to find herself and I need to get a grip on my situation..

I even start wondering if it even does anything and if I even need it. So I stop. A considerable amount of time later, I start circling the drain, going from lethargic to suicidal. Honestly, sometimes I even start wondering if Im depressed or just sad. It does hit hard, but it doesnt stay as long as majorly depressed. Two weeks is long for me. I think thats why I keep telling myself I can handle it without the meds. Part of it is the disdain I feel for people who say theyre depressed so easily just because something marginally upsetting happened to them. I start thinking Do I really have it that bad?

I always think I can help myself..but obviously not. Im wondering if therapy really helps. I want to avoid medication at all costs. Can anyone who has seen a therapist tell me what the experience was and if it helped?",
    "I’m tired of everything and really just wanna quit everything. Im just so tired of everything and wish I could just accomplish the shit I put my mind too but I cant. I have literally no motivation and dont wanna leave my bed but I feel like I have too. I fucking hate the fact that no one takes me seriously or tells me youre fine just because Im 14. Ive been diagnosed with severe recurring depression and moderate anxiety, and yet I feel like its just considered a fucking joke. My life is tearing me in half and so many time I just wish I could find something to do ore motivate me to do something. Honest to god I felt like I feel for a girl really hard and it seemed like things were going well but it seems like she lost interest but still leads me in acting like she wants something to happen but nothing ever does, I have to maintain every conversation and It just weighs me down. I handle a shit ton of stuffpeople will just laugh at me if I said what and I love it but hate it. I wanna do nothing. I just wanna lay in bed with music blasting in my ears so I can forget the world exists. I barely get any hours of sleep anymore, I dont like talking to my parents about anything regarding this because they have no idea how to treat it, and they know my Reddit so Im honestly scared to post this because I dont want them to worry about me because it makes it worse. I just want people to listen to me, I dont want your advice unless I ask for it and just I dont know, I wish everything would just slow down, I wish I could have a best friend, I wish I could find just someone to be there constantly, where we can have fun all the time and just enjoy talking. Im really close to giving up and feel like Im to open with shit. Sorry for ranting I just wish I could do something and be happier, if you have any advice tagging any of this clusterfuck if a rant please tell me. I cant sleep without crying Im so over this.",
    "Letting my boyfriend commit suicide. Please help. Throwaway because he knows my main. My boyfriend wants more than anything to commit suicide. Ive never met someone so sure of anything before. It comes off that way at least. Its not a cry for help, its not for attention, and its not a bluff. Im 100 positive. I try to offer support, solutions, and my love but it makes no difference. I know I have to respect his wishes because ultimately were both prochoice, and I dont want him in pain anymore. I cant handle this reality though. Im in so much pain, and I dont have any support. I love him so much. He says that if I love him, Ill let him go... Please help me...please. Ive had 247 derealization for 4 years now. I also have BPD. I cannot process the my emotions when I think about him dying or when we are talking about it Im the one who asks to talk about it especially if he says something like I despise life or I just want to be done while hes frustrated  and he reluctantly does just a little bit. I go into a very confused state really, I feel a level of confusion most all of the time where my feelings are so overwhelming that I feel like I need to claw my brain out or just hang myself right there. I try not to show this in front of him, but I have had some horrible panic attacks after our conversations. I know this just stresses him out more, and I feel awful about it. I have a SEVERE death phobia. Its always on my mind, and it makes it extremely hard to function daytoday. I have constant intrusive thoughts about bad afterlife scenarios. I guess it may be partly OCD. When I think about him being dead I get so many instrusive thoughts about him not being okay if there is an afterlife  that hes lonely, scared, or in more pain that he was here.",
    "I don't have any motivation, and now I'm screwed I have no motivation or energy Ive been increasingly losing motivation and energy to do anything over the last couple years, but its gotten much worse over the past 6 or 7 months. It clicked about a week ago that I may have depression. Im currently a junior in high school, and I was considered one of the smartest and hard working kids in elementary and middle school. I have big plans for the future and know exactly what I want to do and how Im going to get there, but I have no energy to actually do anything. Ive completely screwed arguably the most important year in high school. Ive barely done any extra clubs or activities after school, my grades have been slipping, and now Im stuck trying to catch up on work. But the closer I get to the end of this week trying to get everything turned in, the less motivation I have and the more stressed out I get. Im not necessarily sad, I just have zero energy. I dont even have energy to get on my phone or play a game for more than 30 minutes at a time. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Im just trying to get motivation for the rest of the week, and Im seeing a therapist on Thursday.",
    "Am I to blame for my boyfriends depression? Me and my boyfriend have a really good relationship most of the time. We want the same things and are usually very in sync, until we have a minor disagreement. To me they are mainly about trivial things like chores, but they always escalate because of how we both act. I get frustrated and either get angry and shout or really upset and cry. He just leaves, actually packs up his bags and leaves home. This happened again yesterday and he left. He came to pack his stuff today and after begging him he eventually opened up to me. He said he feels like a shadow of himself with work, friends, family and that he feels so much better away from me. He said some nasty things yesterday but this was really what he thought, and it really hurt me. Ive been doing some research and think he is depressed, I managed to get him to agree to get help today and said i would give him space for a couple of weeks while hes basically said hes seeing if hes better without me. I can barely breathe without him, and while I am so upset that he has treat me this way I just want him to come back to me. What happens if he realises he doesnt need me? i have no appetite or enthusiasm for anything and dont know how im going to function enough to go to work, let alone make it through the next 2 weeks, or longer, alone",
    "Divorce and depression Hi everyone, Please forgive any misspellings or runons. Focus isnt one of my strong suits at the moment. This is my first post here so I appreciate any advice. So I am at the beginning stages of divorce, which is definitely making my depression worst. I am sure I am about to name off items that people deal with daily or have gone through so please forgive me for redundancy. We have a 3 year old daughter and weve been together for 7 to 8 years 9 married 5 years. Ive never in my life felt anything as soul crushing as this. I cant sleep and even if I do I cant escape through my dreams because its all I dream about. Im 35 years old and I have gone through heartbreaks throughout my years but nothing like this. I dont know what to do... I dont want to hit the bottles cause I know that isnt healthy. The thought of even dating down the road when im ready makes me sick. I honestly want to die but dont have the balls to off myself. Work is a struggle, eating is a struggle, working out is a struggle...this might sound odd but right now I would love to trade places with a tree or just an object that has no feelings.... I dont really have friends, me and family dont communicate, I dont really have anyone thus why I am on here making a post. I though I knew pain but I didnt. Im really struggling, this is the hardest thing in my life at the moment and i feel like my world has come crashing down. Hell I probably cry 36 times a day, short spurts to long cries. I feel really down in the dumps and I just dont know how I am going to prevail. Thank you everyone who reads this and providing input, and thank you to whoever reads this just to read it.

    "Someone else in my skin would be happy, I've no right to be depressed and sinking into alcoholism, yet here I am Im a mid 20s male, college graduate, living in a big city, have a great job. Yet I think about suicide every day. But I feel like I dont have a right to. Other people dont have a lot of the things I have. Im objectively very lucky and have everything I could want to be happy.

The next morning I wake up, go to the gym, and go to work. Then after work I hit the bar again. Alone. Im just so lonely. Why dont people like me. I try not to be an asshole. I really do. I dont think Im an asshole? But I think people are uncomfortable around me. I think I sour their moods. I try not to be negative though. I try really hard. I feel my youth wasting away. I feel the passage of time very heavily. These are supposed to be some great years. Maybe even the best yesrs. Single, big city, acceptably good looking. College certainly wasnt the best years for me. So maybe this is when my life is supposed to peak? But I have no friends. I have no one to hang out with. I dont have a girlfriend. I have no one I connect with deeply. Ive tried cognitive behavioral therapy. But as soon as I stopped going feeling like I was fixed the problems began again. Ive been medicated for depression consistently for years now. Ive even added exercise to my routine at the behest of my doctor. Improved my diet. Stopped smoking weed. I feel like Ive done everything. What can I do now? I feel trapped. I wish I would just die. Life has been very kind to me, and my stupid ass cant take advantage of it.",

    "This is a cry for help... I wanted her but she was into me too? I spent a week chatting with Jane on Instagram. She was absolutely amazing. So, sick of depression and everything, I took a leap of faith. I dropped out of college and moved back to my hometown. A few days later, I heard jane broke up with that asshole because of me. I started dating her and we dated for 2 months. Finally, I was happy after a long time. I was living in heaven. She was so perfect that I was finally happy for a short time in my entire fucking life. I totally forgot about my ex girlfriend and fell in love with Jane. Note Jane is one month older than me. I lost my virginity to her. We had sex for 3 times when we were dating. So I became kinda attached to her, you know? I loved her and she loved me sooo much. We couldnt get enough of each other. Something to add, she was extremely jealous. I thought that was really cute and adorable cause it shows that she cared for me but, our relationship got toxic. She fought with me a few times about those 3 girls I dated in the past! I explained to her that they meant nothing to me and our fights ended with her saying I love you One night she told me she loved me so much. But if she sees that Im flirting with other girls and stuff, she will breakup with me cause she cant tolerate that. I kissed her and told her that there is nothing she needs to worry about. And I meant it. I was 100 loyal and honest to her. But one time one of my friends girl from my excollege commented on one of my Instagram posts miss you. The next day, I realized Jane flirt flirted with a few guys. I asked her what the fuck was going on, and she said I started it. I was heartbroken, told her that was a misunderstanding, and she apologized, which I accepted. But, I was heartbroken cause I couldnt believe Jane wasnt loyal and committed to me.",
    "17 yo male Ive been depressed for 5 years now and I really need help. Ive struggled with cutting and self worth and self image. I finally opened up to my parents but it honestly didnt make it ANY better. I want help but I dont feel comfortable talking about it with many people. Im a Christian but not a very mature one at that. My parents want me to read the Bible and find helpful verses and seek comfort and peace in God. While I agree it works i dont know if Im mature enough to do it. Any advice would help.",
    "Are my feelings valid if I don't cut, or harm myself? I feel like this is a hard topic for me to approach, but I would like to express some things Ive been feeling. Before we start, I would like you to know this is going to be very long, and explaining things that happened in my life, and what I am feeling at this moment. Thank you, all. Truly, Im not sure if I am depressed, but at this moment Im not willing to seek out help, outside of virtually. I hope you all understand that. But I am sad, that much for sure. I cannot express really in words what I feel, other than the fact than waking up is seeming to be a struggle at this point, always feeling overcome with such a gloomy feeling, where if anyone pushed me Id be constantly on the brink of tears. The entirety of being constantly upset, trying to cry, trying to find a way to let out the emotions which you didnt even know you were feeling, but being so empty, you cant even muster tears. I believe I started feeling these feelings around a year ago, after getting out of an abusive relationship. I became so dependent on one person, that I thought I couldnt cope without them. I made excuses for everything they did in my head, and always ran back to them. When they blamed me for their suicide attempts, because I didnt show them enough affection whilst they were hospitalised, though I do not know if she was truly hospitalised, or if it was another facade, I broke. I sent over 100 messages a day, as I knew this would happen if I would not, but she didnt want me to feel happy, despite anything. Not even in the simplest of things to brighten my spirits per say. Anyhow, I had to discard my friends, she had complete control over whom I talked to, and whom I wanted to be friends with. And she forced me to choose between her and them once again. I picked her. It may be irrational to some people why I would do it, but when someone starts convincing you how much you need and rely on them, with all the things youd planned together, with what you said, the words they, and you, said. Its so hard to turn away.",
    "I really want to die, but feel like I can't say it. So Ive been suicidal for 78 years, have a plan, have access to the plans mean of suicide but everytime I mention it the copsambulance are called. I take 30mg Diazepam 180mg pregabalin 12mg buprenorphrine  day. Only the buprenorphine is on a script, the others were prescribed but cutoff about 4 years ago, since then Ive been using the darknet for the diazepam and pregabalin. It is proper medication sourced from spain, with leaflets everything I even sent some samples to Energy Control and they came back fine, 100 what it says on the box. Right now, my GP, my drugworker, my psych are all aware of this me buying illegally from the darknet and giving zero shits but I mentioned Im feeling suicidal to my drugworker pretty much as always, and a CRISIS team was told about it. They called and setup an appointment that I went to today. My worries are that in the past, ambulancepolice teams have turned up to my house and take all my illegal diazpregabs I have no illwill towards the cops, they have to. But it forces me through a 72hour withdrawal until I can place another order and see the psych team who just ask Are you suicidal?, are you going to kill youself today? No? Okay you can go. So now Im feeling like I shouldnt tell anyone, thoughts?",

    "Excessive drinking, help please Hello guys. A friend of mine has always been quite introvert. Preferably staying at home to read a book. He hated alcohol, partying and smoking. And he used to be very socially awkward. Since he became depressed, he started drinking and partying a lot. He also gets drunk quite often, sometimes this will make him scared and I would have to go get him. This isnt the person he used to be. And I know alcohol is bad for his Multiple Sclerosis and Depression. He is using antidepressants. But he doesnt seem to care. I dont recognize him when he behaves like that.. All the while he keeps ignoring peoples texts because he doesnt have the energy to respond. But apperently he does have te energy to party? Which is something i do not understand. I will have a talk with him tomorrow. What can I do or say to support him? How do I make him realize that his behavior is selfdestructive without making things worse? What could be his reason to drink so much alcohol? I really want to understand this huge change in personality, but I keep thinking that depression isnt an excuse for it.

    "The days have nothing to offer for me: Looking for projects or hobbies to ease depression Hey girls and guys, Im suffering from depression and social anxiety since I was 15 years old. Today Im 21. My symptoms are mainly anhedonia disinterest and joylessness, lack of drive, motivation and ability to get stimulated, painful negative thoughts starting right in the morning when I open my eyes about past, present, future, that I dont have anything to offer, that Im disabled, that future life has nothing to offer for me etc., lethargy, low mood, sadness, cognitive restrictions memory, focus, access to knowledge and thoughts and irrational social anxiety. I wake up and see nothing that waits on me, nothing that I wait for or am up to or interested in, no drive or motivation to stand up, nothing that drives me anhedonia again. I then think what reasons or motives do other normal people see when waking up? I feel so empty about what the day has for me. Only thing I can see is food, maybe. Even food is no drive for me, I dont eat that much and dont feel the need to eat, I suffer from lack of appetite due to depression. Sure, I dont have much self worth or confidence at all. I dont have many things Im passionate about or Im good in. I see the connection no things youre passionate drive or good at feelings of success giving self worth gt depression. I still do things. I have a side job, not quite good in it. I study psychology, 5th semestre already, not quite good in it. As already mentioned my cognition turned incredibly bad, I always think Im dumb and unable to follow conversations, intellectual topics and such. Studying and university tasks or contents are very hard for me. I play tennis but rarely, quite good in it. I used to go to the gym, was boring but still quite good for distraction and feelings of success. I produce digital music, quite good in it and makes fun when I have a good day.

She performs songs plays, etc , has a relationship etc. and me? No guy had ever looked my way, my life is literally wake up , school, come home, homework, rinse and repeat.

And it doesnt help that Im a dark skin girl and nowadays boys and men seem to go out of their way especially black men, to point out how they believe dark skin girls are unattractive in all ways. I just feel behind.

    "Please help me I don’t know what to do So for the past month my boyfriend has gone from the happiest boy alive to completely silent, always down, constantly tired, never feeling social and just very sad hes slipping into a depression I know what that feels like and its scary he is going through it About 2 weeks ago he started strictly shirts, no swimming, no showers, no changing, he stopped wanting to be intimate with me, never took his clothes off in front of me until the other night he just completely broke down crying, saying sorry and that he just needed to cuddle I just kept telling him I loved him and eventually he finically started to get tired and we started mucking around I went to tickle him on the stomach and he got very aggressive and defensive pushing me away saying no, dont put your hands there, please dont look I know it was probably wrong but I kept pushing until he gave up and he just started tearing up again there are cuts all over his abdomen and more on the sides of his legs I just hugged him and told him I loved him until we fell asleep But I dont know what to do, Im so scared, Ive been where he is before I have self harmed too Im just so scared and I dont know what he is going to do he has never had any sort of mental illness before and I think hes really struggling I wanna help but I know how hard it is to stop and I just Im scared he is going to kill himself if I dont do something",
    "How do I gain confidence when almost every person I've talked to has put me down for my appearance? I feel so fucking hopeless, even though Ive been working out, trying to gain some healthy weight and muscle, naturally a quiet but nice person who genuinely cares what people think and how they feel. Been adding protein and healthier food options, and attempting to add more daily calories to my diet as to help me look less skinny and more healthier and fit. But at the same time its honestly for nothing, Im worthless and people make sure to remind me of that. I dont know how I was placed on this earth for basically every single person Ive spoken to, to make me feel like a worthless piece of shit. Im only 19 and I feel so fucking ugly, Ive been told by the nicest prettiest girls that I, Look like an old man. on multiple different occasions. Do you realize how fucking painful that is? Imagine if I told that same girl, You look like a 50 year old lady. I fucking guarantee you shed have been heartbroken from hearing that. How the fuck am I the only person in the world who thinks about how my words can possibly hurt someones feelings? Am I the only person who thinks before they speak? My own family has teased my appearance including high school teachers. Ive heard friends of mine overhearing teachers making fun of me behind my back. My OWN friends make fun of my appearance straight in my face. Its impossible to have self confidence when youve literally been proven to be fucking hideous, people dont tease me to share a good laugh. They do it because Im genuinely ugly and nobody cares about how depressed I am and how I have literally not a single person to talk to. I cant get suicide out of my head I dont wanna live with other humans if theyre just gonna make me feel shunned and worthless. I really dont know what to do. Ive tried to make myself the best person I can be but nobody gives me a crumb of appreciation. All my hard work literally doesnt mean anything to anyone and nobody cares. Sure Im doing all this self care for myself, but I need to feel accepted by someone.",
    "I feel depressed I have felt depressed for a while, I have done a lot of things to try and help myself through therapy, sports, working out, videogames, talking to wife, friends and family, church, learning a language, working full time, staying busy, going to university. all I have found is that each time I completely any of these things that I still feel like I am empty. when I do not do those things for more than 10 mins by myself that my thoughts just get dark and I be little everything I have ever done. I think about all the things that I have done in the past, I have talked to many people about them but the pain is just as deep as before. I have decided to stop talking about the stuff cause I can tell that everyone around me is getting bogged down by it and people are more happy when I pretend to be. I am going on trip to the place where all my pain started to hopefully overcome it all and to turn my life around from the pain. I dont know if it will work or not. any tips on what else I can try? Also I get depressed because I have dreams where Im constantly bombarded by women who are not my wife who want to have relationships with me and its a nightly battle to not give in to it when Im dreaming. I know it sounds silly but I fear that if I give into the dreams that I might do it in real life. I dont want to tell my wife because she doesnt understand other weird dreams that I have had in the past.",
    "I'm lost again, I got caught I'm afraid. I havent been able to see a doctor, or a professional who can diagnose and help me, I havent been able to get up the courage to talk about this with anyone. I remember there were nights when I would stay up crying until dawn, where I just wanted to die, where I just wanted to end this pain that I didnt understand where it was coming from. This year there were people who helped me, I was in a very bad situation and they literally saved my life. And thanks to them I was able to help many people in need, especially many children, to see the smiles on the faces of people who have been having a hard time, to see the hope coming back in their eyes has been the best thing that has happened to me this year, I honestly did not think I would make it to the end of the year. My parents dont know, I have to be strong because we have been in a very bad economic situation and I have had to be the man of the house. My younger brother tries very hard, he is working very hard on a sports project, where he has to be concentrated and training seven days a week, and he has me as his anchor, so I always have to be strong for him. Ive been holding on, looking for ways to escape from this, there were moments where I was able to escape although I really dont know how long I managed to avoid it, there are songs that calm me down and make me stop thinking for a while, they make me feel like Im getting out of my head and going to other places, The song Dont you worry child has been one of those, the chorus that says Dont you worry, dont you worry child see heavens got a plan for you has been like a kind of anchor, but every day I feel it working less, the unexplainable pain is coming back out of nowhere. I dont know what to do, Id like to have someone to go to, Im alone and I have no one to seek refuge in. I had been able to keep it away, but it has caught up with me again, this feeling of Im afraid of falling back into the hole and spending every night crying and with that feeling thats like being stabbed in the chest or could get worse, Im lost.",
    "Loneliness, sinking down, and... I am extremely depressed now. This depression sinks me to the bottom today. I am so desperate. If someone in the DFW area reads my post, please DM me. While I was scrolling down my contacts, I found that no one I can contact and ask to meet with me tonight. Those who I have trusted and befriended... I could not call them. I thought that they would laugh or scoff at me. When I was a teenager, I had the protection, socalled parents. However, I feel that I am alone in this world. One night, I called one of my sisters and poured out my emotion. Since I trusted her so much, I told her everything. However, she ignored me and said, Hey, bro, I am so busy with my life. And do not complain about your life. Also, my life is so tough! So could you not throw away your emotion to me? I am not your trash bin! Often, I relied on the counseling service. But, I found that Counseling does not help but exacerbate my depression. The problem of professional counseling is... the counselors have their own frame. And also, at this point, I do not have enough money to receive more counseling services. So, I dont ask for any money but emotional support at this point. I feel that my emotion is collapsing and sinking to the bottom of the abyss.",
    "A bit of a strange case: Exercise has DESTROYED my mental health. Thoughts? Advice? more than I hated swimming. Every second of my 95 minute sessions felt like torture. The intensity didnt matter, as even super lowintensity sessions made me doubt my sanity. But, because Id been so used to doing a huge amount of cardio every day, I literally made myself go to the gym to row. This sent me into a deep depression. I dreaded waking up every day, as I knew that I would have to go do a torturous rowing session at some point during the day. After watching a video on existentialism and Nietzsche, I decided to completely change my life and viewpoint. I realized that what Id been doing for the past year and a half or so was INSANE. What was the point of doing so much cardio? I was already fairly skinny, and I had no plans of becoming an athlete. I realized that I needed to live life to the fullest and actually enjoy myself, rather than wake up every day to torture myself. So I completely stopped doing rowing, and reoriented my fitness focus to strength training, the activity which I had enjoyed for so long. But unfortunately, this didnt work out. The toxic attitude I had regarding rowing poisoned my once beloved activitystrength traininglifting. I hyperfocused on the negative aspects of lifting the pain, the struggle, the discomfort. I no longer enjoyed lifting, instead, I dreadedhated it. It felt like torture as well. This only worsened my depression, as I realized that NO form of exercise would help, or even just have a neutral effect on my mental health. I took a twoweek break from all exercise a couple of weeks ago, and yes, I managed to distract myself with other activities, but when I returned to lifting, my depression returned. Imagine knowing that, for four out of seven days a week, you will be stabbed, shocked, beaten, and tortured. That is how I feel and how I have felt for what seems like so long. I feel like Im a prisoner in Guantanamo Bay, and frankly, Im surprised that more people havent killed themselves in that godforsaken place.",

    "Making the same mistake years later. Hello, sorry for a long post. Ill try to keep it as short as possible. Thank you for whoever reads this. Ill start with events 4 years ago when it all started. I am 22 year old male. I used to work in a bar where I met a girl I instantly fell in love with . We got to know each other well, went on dates etc. She was everything I ever wished for. Im from a small village and I have some good friends here. We were always considered to be the bad guys because we partied a lot etc. I never done drugs thought. She always assumed I do drugs and one day I decided to take some to impress her  stupid I know I guess to keep up with the bad guy reputation. Problem is, I fell in love with cocaine. And thats when my life went into a downwards spiral. I started taking cocaine for breakfast everyday. I turned it an angry mess, our relationship slowly got ruined. I was angry at her one day and tried sleeping with her best friend. I was nothing but a scumbag. I was a cheating, lying scumbag. I didnt see that at the time but now its very clear for me to see. She deserved better than me After overdosing once, We broke up and she moved away. I decided I had enough and went sober. I went through some very rough time then. I was very deeply hurt and depressed. Day by day it got better. 4 years have passed and I still never fully got over her even when I was with other girls but I was living more or less fine. I dont really like this town but I have some great friends and reasonably good new job. Anyway, after all these years, last weekend I was out drinking with friends and I met an old friend who offered me a bag of cocaine for some reason i snapped back to my old habits and bought a bag. I knew she was back in town, later on I ended up at a house party where I got in to a very bad state with drugs and alcohol.",

Im very new to taking antidepressants so i dont want to disregard them just yet so am trying to hopeful about them. I had sporadically seen some therapists over the years but not currently seeing one. my job is okay but Im getting bored with it and I wouldnt know where to go even if I could move to a different one. I guess Im just feeling very lost and down and my motivation just isnt there anymore.

    "I just don't care badly enough unless I'm in a crisis. Nothing is really interesting or exciting. How do I care enough ? I cant get myself to work on my resume. I cant get myself to apply to jobs. I cant get myself to look for a new doctor. I cant get myself to read a book. Im not even interested in planning a trip. Its all just whatever to me. I only do things if I HAVE to or if Im inspired by a strong emotion. Like if Im angry, Ill do something. But that wont last long. I used to be ambitious. I used to care a lot more. I used to have some sense of passion. Now  I see just how powerless Ive always been and how overall meaningless it is to care so god damn much. I understand I need to be providing others with something of value to get value in return. I understand that the more value I can give, the more value I get. Its just that whatever value I can get in return just doesnt really appeal to me. None of it is incredibly interesting or exciting. And even what I would classify as the most exciting  its not like I can accomplish it. I cant attract the type of life companion that I want because I wouldnt even date myself.

    "Scared of starting antidepressants Im a 22 year old guy Currently in college studying economics, in my 5th year. I struggle with depression, GAD and minor OCD. I have major issues with motivation. Most of the time, especially when Im stressed out the most, I lack any motivation whatsoever. There are a couple fields that interest me, but the college experience has been very stressful for me altogether. However, Im not motivated to do anything. Starting a new degree doesnt motivate me because Im not passionate about anything in particular, except for statistics, and my degree is the best to undertake a specialization in that which I want to do. Very often, if not almost everyday, its hard to get up from bed. Its hard to eat. Its hard not to cry. I have the full support from my parents, I have friends, I dont struggle financially yet Im profoundly unhappy. I hate myself as well. I have suicidal ideation very often. Im scripted benzos but I want to drop them for antidepressants. Benzos make my anxiety better and make me motivated and cheerful but theyre not something designed for long term use. So I want to ask my doctor for an antidepressant script, since he is a very kind and understanding guy and Im sure hed script me what he thinks is best however Im profoundly scared of side effects. I have more exams in one month and Im scared to be hit by side effects during them and that they might make it even worse. Idk if its irrational. But thats my thought process.

    "Struggling So I have always struggled with depression but after I had met my husband 8 years ago I started doing really well and for the most part didnt have depression. We were always doing stuff to keep busy and keep my mind off the stuff that would bring me down. Well fast forward to now and I am just feeling at the end of my rope. My health took a 180 about two years ago and I now struggle with quite a few health problems that keep me from doing the things I use to do. I cant even do simple things that a lot of people take for granted. And now I see what toll it is taking on my husband to have to take care of me so much and it kills me. He has become so short and angry at the world and has made comments that make me feel like I am to cause for all this. I am sure that is not how he feels just how it makes me feel I just wish I could make all the pain and hurt go away. I feel myself slipping further and further away and I dont know how to cope anymore. Just wish I could quit feeling like this all the time. Any Advice would be greatly appreciated.",

My brain has been fried, neglected, and has deteriorated to the point where I may be able to understand complex ideas, but Im slower to process than your average remedial student. This is why I suffer at work and in conversation, I have to try very hard just to understand what people are asking of me and sometimes they just sound like unintelligible chatter unless I focus very hard. Its like Im underwater. Im completely incapable of multitasking and it costs the store money because of things I continually mess up and forget about. The only thing I have is speed and I can make things look nice, that keeps me scheduled. But Ive gotten lectured so many times about fuck ups. None of my opinions about the world are well received. I think that we need to get along by compromising and meeting eachother in the middle. People these days are to one extreme or the other. I feel even crazier not having anyone agree with, what to me, seems so intuitive. Nothing is right for me and Im so tired of feeling this much pain. I cant see a path to making things better or I would move towards it. Im not giving up I just dont have anymore options and I want somebody to just help give me some clarity. Ive watched people like jordan peterson and alan watts to try two different paths of fulfillment and neither works to calm my mind.

    "Advice on intrusive thoughts? Hi! Im 19F and have been going through a depressive episode since late Decemberearly January. Its the first time Ive had this, or at least to this extent. Im on 50mg sertraline, but have begun to decline again more recently, so am making a doctors appointment about the possibility of increasing my dose. My parents are both mental health professionals so Im pretty lucky there, able to get advice on how to verbalise feelings, and what they think I would benefit from. Anyway, the reason Im writing is because Im suffering pretty badly with what I can only describe as intrusive thoughts. For me, theyre all memories of times Ive hurt someone or done something negative. A lot of them are extremely minor or where nobody was hurt, but I do so much mental gymnastics to the point that they seem life destroying. They almost feel like flashbacks, and I get more intense panic than I had while the events were actually happening. Theyll come if Im doing uni work, watching TV, in the shower, just woken up.. it doesnt matter. So my questions are has anyone experienced this sort of thing? If so, how do you deal with it? Ive been recommended EMDR and given details of a good therapist who could do this. Is this recommendation echoed by anyone with personal experience? Thanks ahead of time, and let me know if any more info is required! !",

It is almost always met with shock, them thinking in silence for a minute, then asking why. Like they are expecting a one word response like religion, which isnt the case. Im just trying to figure out whats going through peoples heads when I say this. It usually just kills the conversation or brings it to a topic I dont really want to discuss. It even catches some guys off guard a lot of times and they seem to usually behave around me differently so its not even just girls acting this way. Also I only bring this up when asked, I dont go around broacasting this. Am I just going about telling people the wrong way or is it a major red flag that I have to live with?",

It feels like I was born on the wrong planet or the wrong time and to make it all worse no matter how long I sit and logically think about it I cannot think of way out of this hell other than suicide, just selling my timelife away as a slave, or just being homeless. And to top it all off when I was 13 or 14 my hair started thinning and during high school with my thin hair everyone Including every single person close to me even teachers started making fun of me saying things like crackhead or you look like an old man, you look like a hobo, Looks like Albert Einstein, Do you wash your hair? and while it sounds hilarious from an outside perspective eventually after hearing dozens of different people say this constantly my entire juniorsenior year it has really dragged me through hell and back just trying to keep myself from going completely insane and it caused me to completely lose any self confidence I once had. All that I really want is a female to love me and a place of my own to stay at without having to owe other people anything. Just me and a lover free to be ourselves to do what we want, live how we want but theres always someone else who thinks its in their place for you to owe them money and money is whats completely ruined my idea of a happy life. Its literally unfair for someone else to tell me how to live but the government thinks they can tell people weed is illegal to possess yet thats fake as fuck like nothing is illegal if it was then some nonhuman force would seek redemption for me possessing weed but no, its other people telling ME that Ill be punished by other human beings if I have weed by throwing me in a cage for doing something of my own consent. or insert anything illegal that I choose to have in my life Does the government have consent of MY BODY? Yes they do if they can throw me in a cage for ingesting something of my choosing. Is living as a truly independent human just completely impossible? To live without being under someone elses rule?",

    "My girlfriend died and then before i could get any closure for myself covid came around and i haven’t even gotten a chance to talk it out with anyone To begin with i am a 17 year old guy, who used to be in a four and halfyear long relationship. Now, initially, we were just best friends who thought of the term girlfriend and boyfriend as a special friend and decided to well start dating. She had an insane amount of problems on her side of the family, her parents were in prison, her siblings both dead and a shit ton more. So a big chunk of our time was me supporting her, comforting her and so on, and well i ended up getting really attached. I was so close to her that i ended up developing somniphobia which was something she struggled with and not me. 2 years ago my grandfather went ahead and killed himself, which came as a massive shock to both of my parents, who had spent over an year to get him back in shape both mentally and physically. During that entire time span, I ended up being neglected and would only talk to my girlfriend. We were very close and would talk almost 45 hours daily, so when she got caught up in a car crash and suddenly passed away, i didnt take it well and i still dont. Neither my parents nor my siblings know anything about this, since my household is not supportive of relationships till i become 18. Its been almost 11 months now and i need someone to help me get over her. Anyone have advice how to?

    "Feeling at the end of the line My wife knows about my rape and thanks to her I was able to talk to my sister about it too, needless to say I broke my sisters heart but also made us closer, she also was kind enough to pay for private professional help for me and her to deal with this, I also opened about this with an uncle my mothers brother who I thought was someone completely different to what he turned out to be, when I told him about the rape he broke hard and I took him to talk with the therapist I was seeing thanks to my sister, and what she told me before the therapist and told to him later changed everything, she said that I needed some sort of compensation for what had happened in order to move on, it wasnt possible to get legal justice due the time frame of the events and the lack of evidence beyond my word and she didnt suggest anything more beyond that we should try to figure it out, of course telling the whole family was my first thought and let the truth have its day, but my uncle mothers brother begged me not to tell anything because it would destroy the family, specially my mother who has a lot, and I mean a lot of love for the uncle who raped me, she my mother basically raised him the first 4 years of his life because his parents had a busy and privileged life and he the rapist is seen by the rest of the family as a great guy and an example, with this he mothers brother convinced me not to tell anything, I know I could have just said no and told everything to everyone but thinking what could I possibly put my mother through after seeing how his brother took the news made me feel trapped and basically Ive been living feeling like a prisoner and the responsible for my entire family being together or not. My dear wife, my love, only she keeps me sane holding me when Im about to broke and unfortunately with all that Ive mentioned before about not being able to get a job it has begun to be a frequent occurrence and I can see it is taking a toll on her, Ive busted my eyes and my back studying and working hard on small jobs non related to my career just to keep us going and whenever seems to be an opportunity all I get are rejections or I get to watch people getting jobs because of political favors, and what has led me here is the thought that I am the common factor in all of this, and everyone specially my wife would be better off if I am no more, we would love to be able to begin a family but it would be so irresponsible to bring a child to this world under this circumstances, and this also makes my wife so sad, she cries in my shoulder but tells me that we will pass this and everything will be fine, but Ive lost almost all hope, and given our age and financial situation it looks that if she keeps being by my side she will never have the family and the life she deserves.",

Im very aware of everything thats happening but at the same time Ive no idea whats going on mainly emotionally. I cant function properly, I sleep a lot and have no appetite. I only feel energetic when Im with somebody else but when Im alone I just feel physically and emotionally drained.

I cant keep charring on this fire just because others might miss me. Id miss them too if I could take the memories with me.

    "How do I muster the energy to cook and eat, especially at the end of the day? Does anyone have tips or psychological tricks for getting yourself to eat regularly, especially at dinner? Im pretty good about eating on days when I have classes college student. I always eat before class so I can be energetic and focused and because stomach grumbles are embarrassing. I always have a healthy big breakfast. My problem is with weekends and dinner. Im usually mentally tuckered out after classes and interacting with people and rush to get home. When I come home, all I can do is curl up in my bed and maybe do homework in bed. Even doing something small like changing into PJs and brushing my teeth is very tough. Taking time to prep food and eat it is just a lot of mental effort, even if its just microwaving leftovers. I also live with others  I feel safe in my room but going into the kitchen is leaving my safety zone. My roommates are great but at the end of the day I really dont want to see anyone except maybe my best friend. When he comes over for dinner on occasion I feel motivated to cook and eat, but he usually has evening classes or work so I cant always rely on his presence. Or if Im out with friends and were getting fast food I can eat because I dont have to put in any effort and Im outside anyways. And weekends are really tough because I hate leaving my room just for food and I dont feel the same need to eat without classes to attend or things to do. So I end up eating one very hasty big meal of sandwiches or something when I get really hungry. Can anyone relate? Any psychological tricks people have for making themselves eat and get ready for bed? When I was living with family someone would usually tug me to the dinner table at night, but no one does that to me in college  I find it difficult to stay at a healthy weight for this reason. Its really easy to drop a few pounds when Im under additional stress some weeks I just cant do dinners at all.",

She showed me their texts and she was talking about doing it because she wants to kill herself so she wont listen to anyone who tells her to get help. Im thinking about going to the guidance counselor because she already expressed that her parents wont schedule her an appointment even though shes asked. Shes diagnosed with depression because shes had one appointment but never got another. I dont want her to be upset with me and shes telling me herself to force her to eat.

    "I want to learn to appreciate the positive gay inclusion and acceptance, and stop letting homophobia and gay exclusion and alienation burden me I am a feminine gay guy. So, not only am I guy, but I like being feminine too in my appearance and behavior. And especially online, I keep on and on and on coming across SO many people against homosexuality, andor people against men being allowed to be feminine. ampx200B And what I have been using since I was a kid to try to help make me feel better is feelgood escapism in the forms of movies and shows. But as an adult, I cant even use that, since the type of movies and shows Im interested in keeps excluding homosexuals and feminine guys. And even when they dont, the representation is poorly handled. ampx200B I love fantasy, I love science fiction, I love superhero stuff, I love animated stuff. Literally only example of a feminine male character Ive seen depicted in a good proper way is in the Youtubeexclusive animated show Hazbin Hotel. And, when it comes to a homosexual male romance where you get to see the two males fall in love, share their first kiss, become a couple, and stay a couple without either one of them dying at any point? To my knowledge, it doesnt exist within these genres. ampx200B But I try very hard to stay positive, and appreciate what I DO have as opposed to what I dont. I got that Hazbin Hotel character Angel Dust. And I got an openly gay male character in the ParaNorman movie, and in Avengers Endgame. So, good step in the right direction I suppose. ampx200B And furthermore, people ARE getting more gaysupportive, and more people are encouraging gay inclusion. So rationally, I should know better.

    "Helping a friend with depression Heyy there! I just found out that a very good online friend of mine suffers from depression and feeling down. Initally she just asked for advice regarding a crush of hers who already is in a relationship. When talking to her about it tho, she told me a few things that really got me worried. On the one hand, she feels understood by him. She feels like herself around him and like she doesnt have to fake her happiness. On the other hand, she admitted to sending him nudes, as he told her Id be okay to send some from time to time and it could even be there hot little secret Needless to say, Im really worried now. I gave her the advice to stay away from himstop contact with him and also came to an agreement, that her and I would look for a psychologist at the same time so niether of us feels like a crazy person needing psychiatric help lol Still, Ill continue to try and help her. I already thought about asking her how she feels although it is incredibly hard for her to open up about her feelings, but also motivating her to go out or try something new or something. Just fyi I never met her personally, she lives about two hours away. We do talk jokingly about meeting up some time soon tho, so maybe Ill see her soon. Do you have some more advice on how I could help her? Even if its just a small thing, any help is greatly appreciated!",

    "How to help boyfriend with depression who won’t open up to me My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 2 years. We both have had our struggles with depression. Recently I see he has been feeling down once again. He doesnt want to go to a therapist because  he knows whats wrong, he just doesnt have the motivation to do anything about it. in his exact words I dont want to go to therapy because I see therapy as guidance method for improvement. I dont feel like I need guidance, my problem is one of will and circumstance, I dont doubt that I could benefit from it, but right now I see it as going out of my way to do something I dont prioritize Even though weve been together a while, he still does not feel comfortable opening up to me about how he is feeling. Ive asked him ways that I can help him feel better, or support him and he says that talking about it wont make him feel better. Is there anything I can do to help him? I hate seeing him be down like this and be unable to help him. Ive also tried giving him space and left him alone for a bit. Am I being selfish for trying to help him?

    "I just realized I'm very depressed but I don't know why. My dandruff got much worse, and the suicidal thoughts came back every once in a while. Not sure if its got anything to do with this but I started driving really aggressively, well past the speed limit even after a ticket, something I didnt do when I got my license. Lastly, Ive always been very thin, as a male I still weighed around 120lbs ish. Now Im around 130, which I know is still nothing, and I dont think Im fat or anything like that, but Id never in my life gained weight, and suddenly I was 10 lbs heavier in a matter of a few months. All of this paragraph started around the same time. Today I was talking to a friend of mine over the phone and for some reason he just asked me are you depressed? Which left me thinking, yet my college classes distracted me for enough time. Today at dinner my mom finally lashed out over my lack of hygiene, its then that I realized I havent showered in months, nearly a year of sometimes washing my hair or just standing under the water every once in a while. I showered and it dawned on me that I, probably have depression. The mere realization made me cry more than Ive cried in years. I read all about seek help and tell your parents about it but Im kind of ashamed to admit it. Theyve given everything to provide for me and my sister, and Ive got all the ingredients for what Id assume is a normal and functioning life. It feels like I have no right to be feeling like this when theres people who have it much worse than me. Im posting it here because I need anonymous support. Im not yet ready to admit it out loud,but I think Im depressed. P.

I am currently on Effexor after trying a bunch of meds and stable enough that Ive held down a FT job for 3.5 years and now have a livein partner. The details of my days, however, arent great.

    "How in the actual heck does one love themselves I have a very bad problem in that the only way to love myself is that I receive love from other people a potential girlfriend. This is apparently very unhealthy and self destructive. Problem is, that is all I know about how to love myself. I have been told to love myself but I find that VERY difficult to do. I was raised in a household with a mother who was infuriated and enraged with seemingly small things and took things way too far pretty frequently. She took a lot of her anger out on my father and she did so in plain sight of me and my sister. Her use of pure hatred and rage towards my father rubbed off onto me. The difference is, that unlike her, I have the common decency to keep all this inside my head. A lot is directed towards the outer world and a lot is directed towards myself. I cant love myself, because the only two things I feel for myself are hatred and rage, so I look to unspoiled minds for affection. I know this is self destructive and it will just push me closer to pulling the trigger or jumping off the cliff, I know that. ampx200B I am looking for real, tangible, practical and usable advice for how to love oneself.

    "Need help/advide Hi so I need some guidance as I feel very lost at the minute. Ive suffered from anxiety and depression for years now, but when I graduated university last summer things just spiralled out of control to the point where I was put on anti depressants again and my doctor told me I wasnt fit for work. The anti depressants have helped with my depression but my anxiety is still that bad that doing anything but sitting in my room is a massive struggle. A couple of weeks ago my doctor said I should start to be eased in to a job again, but I had a work capability assessment a few days ago and got told that I should take a year of sick pay and focus on getting better, as if I got a job I would likely crash within a few weeks, and this has happened before. Im running out of things to say when friends and family ask if Ive got a job, so this is a nightmare situation especially as the only person whos not a professional who knows is my mum. And its all well and good trying to focus on getting better but Ive been trying for many years now and havent made much progress, recently Ive been trying mindfullness and working out but neither has helped much I also start counselling again next week but this has never helped much either. I want to work, be happy, not be anxious all the time and not feel so alienated from everyone else my age and society in general. What should I do? Has anyone else been in a similar situation and recovered? Can anyone point me in the right direction of something that would help?",

    "Complete recovery after depression is a realistic expectation? Hey, before depression took over my life I23F used to be such a happy person  joyful, positive, hyped about all kinds of activities, passionate about life. Before finishing college I used to think that lack of time is my only problem, I had so many plans and wishes and I used to think that depression isnt a real thing, that some people just choose to be unhappy. And then it hit me  repressed childhood trauma, unhealthy relationships with my family members and too many disappointments in my love life gave me depression. At first I thought its only a bad phase and I was expecting it to end soon since I was about to start my summer vacations. I had planned a 2 weeks trip to Scotland and I was really hyped about it for like 6 months before leaving, but somehow I couldnt enjoy it, I only wanted to sleep and be alone and I was struggling to get through each day without being rude or visibly irritated by everything was going on around me. Thats when I realized that bad phase was a special one, but I only decided to get specialized help when I was already 4 months deep into it. At that point I was a mess, crying several times every day, spending all my free time sleeping, being terrified of my own thoughts, started thinking about suicide, pursuing a toxic online relationship, being unable to watch movies or reading books due to losing my ability to concentrate. At that moment, one of my best friends told me I was only a shadow of the person I used to be. The best feeling I was able to get about anything was this is almost acceptable. After my first visit to the psychiatrist I was put on medication and after only one month things became a little bit brighter for me  Christmas was coming and I started WANTING TO DO STUFF AWAKE!! I started watching netflix again, playing video games, hanging out with friends. I was still sad mostly, but I was able to enjoy these things from time to time which was nice. I also got fired right before Christmas for sleeping too much at work and doing almost nothing because of my depression, but I wasnt even mad about it.",

    "Death Anxiety Like, Ill feel great doing these things and then Ill think that was nice, but Im going to forget that it happened and cease to exist eventually. Ugh. The whole thing makes life feel unreal and dreamlike. Im scared to die. I want to be alive. I want my self to be connected to everything. I dont want to fade away into nothing. Ive tried spirituality and I will continue to because i think does help more like a temporary fix though, but its based on so many opinionsmaskingastruths that my overactive brain just wont stop picking it apart and reducing it whenever I try to participate. I guess Im sad that Im stuck right now being a reductionist and a realist, and that my inner self seems to want to do this even though I know Im much happier when Im blissfully ignoring these kinds of questions. Now I get the sense that if I ever want out of this, Ill have to think my way out but every time I try it seems to make it worse. I dig myself deeper into this pit by engaging with it. I can feel myself enjoying music, art, video games, podcasts, books and movies less. They all feel like distractions, which I guess everyone kinda knows they are, but it just feels really clear and I wish it wasnt. If any of this sounds like you, and youve gotten past it, please let me know. Note I switched up my meds and they do seem to be helping with stuff like anxiety attacks and suicidal ideation but the depression feels deeper than just a chemical imbalance",
    "What should I try next? I have severe depression and anxiety. I am currently in a particularly bad episode. It is truly hellish and I can do very little. Between episodes I can be fairly high functioning, but I am finding that I am dilapidating more and more each year. Work and relationships are becoming increasingly impossible even during the good phases. I have tried psychotherapy ongoing still, CBT, DBT, citalopram, venlafaxine still in withdrawal, psilocybin therapy produced traumatising hell trips, diazepam, lorazepam, propranolol, zopiclone, exercise 5x per week, sleep, SAD lamps, meditation, good nutrition, prayer, selfharm, changing jobs, going back to education, selfhelp books, sauna, icebaths, living alone, living with friends, living with parents, float tanks, supplements and some other stuff. I have an ok job and live alone in an ok studio. Friends and family are generally supportive, although I have a poor, disconnected, awkward relationship with parents. No matter what, the good phases never feel that good and the horrifying, suicidal phases always keep returning. I think a lot of metacognition contributes a lot fear of what others are thinking about me especially partner and work colleagues, overthinking everything, regret and frustration about all these diseases are doing to me. If anyone has any ideas on what helps or maybe works for them, Id be interestedgrateful. I havent gone into a full description of my symptoms as dont want this to drag on too long, but am happy to answer any specific questions. Peace.",
    "Is this one of the signs? Hello people. For the last few years i noticed that if i sing a childhood show theme song i would suddenly get teary eyed, and so i had to stop singing. Is this also a sign of depression? Im a 37y male, married with one daughter who is 19 months old. I have work as a doctor for almost 10 years now. I have to admit this last few years i have been receiving more and more pressure, and i have been having lesser and lesser good night sleep. I havent consulted to a psychologist or psychiatrist, havent taken any drug. I once had a depression session where i feel like i just want to go and disappear. I was seeking online help back then. This few years though i havent feel that down, though i feel that my energy is very low, i feel easily tired, not excitable, and beginning to start forgetting things. I usually have very good memory.y hobby is playing games, watching anime amp collecting toysfigures, though I havent been able to play games or watch anime for about these last 4 months because of being too busy.",
    "I'm probably just faking it? Lately I feel like Im faking my own mental issues. I read this post about a girl who is abused by her mother and homeless. My own best friend is abused by her parents. My mom grew up in a terrible environment and is traumatized. I was bullied for a few years at kindergarten and school and I get yelled at by mom. A lot of people told me that those are not reasons to be depressed, that Im just exaggerating and Im an attention seeker. I feel like theyre right?? There are a lot of people who are going through worse stuff and theyre not able to get help. Someone else definitely needs that hour of therapy more than me. My mind is very mean to me lately. Theres this kind of voice who is telling me that Im just a lazy piece of shit who is faking their own illness for attention. This makes me feel even more shitty. I cant take it anymore. Im not diagnosed because my mom doesnt allow me to get therapy and I rarely go to the doctor only if absolutely necessary. I dont know, is it normal to feel like youre faking your own mental issues? sorry if there are any mistakes, english is not my first language and my mind is all over the place, hopefully you understood what I wrote",
    "Months, maybe years without my SO Hello everyone, I am currently feeling not like myself as a lot of people in this situation do but i wanted to ask you for help. I am not in my right state of mind now, and understanding or coping with information s very poor. I would like to hear your opinion on this, thank you... Due to the Covid19 outbreak in europe, almost every country now closed borders, including mine. I understand this precautions and their nesessity but I am still very anxious and sad that i wont see my boyfriend for some time... He lives in country right next to mine. It doesnt seem like our cases of covid19 are severe like in other states, but I heard someting about borders being closed for couple months or years in our country depending on others states. It makes me very confused and anxious. Does it mean that I wont see him, even though our two countries will be completely clean just because of those countries that will still be infected? That thought makes my already bad mental health worsen.",
    "Help me get rid of the thought that I'm not enough please I just have periods of time where I will have my mind that tells me if I dont have anyone in my life and all my friends are in a relationship, it means that Im just not enough for anyone. I never had anyone in my life. It would mean that Im not interesting enough. Not loveable enough. That Im not worth it. That spending time will me, and love me is a complete waste of time. I consciously know that I probably have something good in me well I do hope so at least. But when I am spiralled into these thoughts, I just cant get out of it. Can anyone help me and tell me how they get out of this please? I literally feel my heart breaking because of my mind. Thank you.",
    "What else can I do? I just turned 36 and feel like my life has passed me by. Relationships are nonexistent in my life, life in general has just gotten progressively worse. I dont know what else to do at this point. This has been a 16 year journey to find freedom from depression with no distinguishable positive results, unfortunately  not even a little bit. Ive followed through to completion with ketamine infusions, 10 different medications for depressionanxietyadhd, neurofeedback biofeedback treatments, Ive seen 8 different therapists, a handful of psychiatrists, life coaches, psychoanalysts. Ive taken psychedelics. Occasionally with a new drug or treatment, I break free momentarily  I feel infinitely less burdened  I feel hope  this usually only lasts a day or at the very, very most a few days... I always, always fall back to where I was again. I force myself out of sheer will to exercise and eat healthy every day, that definitely helps  without that, I would be so much more miserable. But the fog is still there. the selfdefeating thoughts still there  nothing is ever good enough. I still feel so stuck, unmotivated, and deprived of life. I heard of TMS Therapy  I spent the last of my savings on the ketamine infusions so I cant afford them right now, even with insurance. Im terrified it will only work for a bit of time, then Ill have thrown away thousands of more dollars in the process. I am not a quitter.. I have no desire to end my life. I just dont know what is left to do to feel joy in my life, to break free from this once and for all. Is there hope here? I dont know what to do next... Does anybody have suggestions",
    "Hey please hear me out So my mother and sister tested positive for covid just now. And Im scared. Earlier Id hear cases rising and people dying and it didnt really bother me much. I knew its a serious problem. But thats all, I just knew. I never realized the gravity of this pandemic till before it came to my doorsteps. Im just an ordinary guy who cares for his family a lot. I dont show it to them or anyone but Im in my room scared out of my mind. I cant concentrate on my studies and my college entrance exams are around the corner. So basically I just NEED to know that theyre gonna be fine. Any advice, consolation, help right now would be much appreciated by me Thanks may you and your family be safe and live long happy lives.",
    "Goodbye. Hello, I am a 15 year old Male and plan to stab myself in the stomach and chest. I cant do anything right and nobody likes me what so ever. I am ignored and nobody even acknowledges me. All the bad in life isnt worth the good in life. My own voice and mind being my own enemy no matter what I do, pointing out everything bad in a situation. Nothing matters in the end. I have tried to take my life before but this time I promise Ill be successful and Ill no longer be a burden on everyone. Nobody is responsible for this except for me.

    "Supporting my girlfriend Hello all! Please remove this is this isnt the right place. Ive been close with this girl for months now and weve recently started dating. Shes opened up about being on antidepressants, very briefly, but Im glad she feels comfortable at least bringing it up. I told her how I feel, which is that she can talk to me any time, she wouldnt be annoying me, I want to help her feel good, things like that. I dont want to be overbearing but I do want to support her. Most importantly I dont want her to feel alone. I am fully aware and ready to help her with this. Some words of advice on how to be there for her would be greatly appreciated!",
    "Sometimes the worst part isn't what happened to us but being alone with the pain from what happened to us Ive had a crisis today from a breakdowntantrum in front of my parents and its late into the night that my friends who wouldve normally supported me are asleep and also all crisis phone or text lines are especially understaffed around this time. I dont use suicide hotlines or access amp crisis phone lines or text lines anymore all those things that my former therapists recommend because of how many times Ive felt worse afterwards or been hung up on dealing with someone whos already numbed and burned out themselves. I get it, the mental healthcare system is understaffed and underfunded and the therapists Ive had, its just been so disappointing and regressive to my health. Its just like the classic conditioning example if you shock a mouse enough times everytime it tries to eat food, itll be too afraid to eat even when the threat is long gone. Rarely are people seeking for advice and answers, most times people just want to be seen and heard and feel supported. I got angry at my mom for sharing some news with my brother on the phone, which was something she was talking highly of me for but nonetheless I felt very angry because I despise my brothers for how much theyve ruined my life and I had a tantrum in front of my parents because I was reminded of the last time my brother rubbed it in my face of my depression and financial situation when we fought and despite my mom giving him good news of mine hell probably use that to mock me with when Im back to a poorer financial situation again. Im hurt and angry and also guilty that I got angry at my mom who was just trying to talk highly of me but I very much want nothing to do with my brothers. Ive had a terrible relationship with my negligent parents all my life and Im fortunate that they actually feel guilty and sorry about all that and have been genuinely trying to help me now. I spent some money on something helpful for my mom that she very much uses and loves because Im grateful for her help which was what she was talking about and after getting angry at her but expressing it in an unhealthy way I feel like shit.",
    "Lost motivation, want to quit... please help Fourthyear med student currently in the midst of clinicals. Just cant find the motivation to study or attend online tutorials or go for wards anymore. I feel so tired everyday, sometimes I wish I would just die in my sleep amp not wake up the next morning. Nowadays, whenever I try to study or listen to the online lectures, either my head feels like its in a haze amp nothing goes in, or I get palpitations, breathlessness amp feel like puking. amp in the wards, I feel totally dissociated from whats going on during rounds. Im so sick the endless cycle of trying to complete anki reviews amp revise my notes, in addition to having to cram in new information that the doctors in the wards quiz us on amp say we must know otherwise well fail the exams. Yet, whenever I try to take a break, I feel even more anxious amp guilty for slacking, amp cant enjoy any of the hobbies I used to like. My insomnia has been getting worse amp worse, amp the times that Im finally so tired that I crash, I dont wake up feeling refreshed in the morning. I seriously dk how my classmates manage to stay so enthusiastic about medicine amp how they have the stamina to constantly discuss studyrelated thingsmeet up for practice all the time. Also, Im so scared Ill turn into a monster lose my sense of humanity because it hasnt even been 2 years into clinicals yet amp already, I feel numb to patients stories like every other history I take has been reduced to symptom complex gt diagnosis gt investigations gt management plan. Its so disillusioning to see the doctors in the hospital so jaded amp overworked that over time, the focus just becomes discharging patients as fast as possible amp documenting changes on computers wheeled around the wards to protect against legal liability. Some of them even talk demeaninglymake snark comments about patients behind their backs, amp while I dont expect doctors to be saints, especially given the tough working conditions, it really makes me question my decision to join med school.

    "How do I process a break up with depression and anxiety In April, I 25F blew up on my boyfriend 24M because his communication was extremely poor and he still had his dating apps. I kept mine to spy on him and until he finally deleted his. In November, he ghosted me because I blew up on him for being online on Badoo. we met on My trigger is rejection because I havent seen my father in 21 years. I get hysterical because I relive the abandonment and rejection over again I begged for him to come back and he did 3 weeks later. But, I always took the blame. He claimed that he used it to get weed. Fast forwards to April, the last time I saw him in person he got a notification from Bumble to come back and use the app. He told me he wasnt using it but I lost it and asked to see if he received a message but he wouldnt show me. Then, I asked him to delete all the apps on his phone. He claimed he couldnt get into Badoo because he needed to go through his email to get the password and it would take to long. Then, he didnt message me for over week, he does this all the time to me. He worked nights and it was a long distance relationship. All I wanted was how are you, good morning and good night text. I was always the one initiating the conversations. When i complained he would only communicate for 2 weeks and then stop. Also, he was never been there for me. After this point, I blew up, told him if he couldnt delete the rest of the dating apps and give me more communication or it was over. He never answered me back. Due to my depression trigger, I freaked out. I begged for him back again. He answered and was quiet again so I went to his house but never answered. After that, he stopped messaging me. Its been almost a month. I cannot sleep well even though Im on medication, I get panic attacks, have anxiety all the time about him replying back to me, being alone again, rejection and where my life is heading especially with this virus because I was suppose to move in with him.",
    "Hair loss The past year of my life has been a rollercoaster of hell type emotions. I have went through a lot and my hair seems to be paying for it. About 5 months ago, my hair started shedding like crazy. It wasnt as bad as the previous month. Everytime I touch my hair I lose about 1015 strands. I have never had hair loss as great as this and I suspect it has to do with my depression and anxiety. Are there any tips and tricks I can use to salvage my hair ?",
    "I got kicked out of my house six months ago, and the only thing keeping me alive is fear, work, and my boyfriend. For context Im 20, F, and very new to Reddit I got kicked out of my house in late September, about a week after I graduated cosmetology school, due to an argument I got into with my step dad that resulted in him screaming, threatening, and punching the wall behind me. After two weeks of couch surfing, I bought a plane ticket to California from Texas with the last of my money, and moved into my best friends families home. Its been six months now and I constantly feel like I should just give up. I got a retail job at a company I had previously worked for within about two weeks of me moving, and other than that I havent done much else. I dont have a car, I havent looked into going back to school or pursuing any kind of education, Ive had a couple of falling outs now with the friends who encouraged me to move here best friend who Im living with included, and my relationship with my family has never been more toxic. The only thing that is holding me together is this job, my boyfriend whos been doing his best through out all of this, and being too cowardly to commit to killing myself. And I hate that Im posting all of this because it feels like such a pity party, but I dont know what to do anymore. I dont know where to go to get help, but I do want to.",

Every day i think on suicide. I dont know if this is sad. Once on tv i saw a childhood abuse case and i didnt feel empathy I guessgt Some time I feel empathy principal when i was reading comic books. Even when people are bad with me I imaginated them in a dangerous situation but I feel bad and save them. It happens with my brother. Mom and Papa too. Shame of being a member of my fmaily.

    "I give up. Nothing makes me happy. Im so tired. So so tired. The more I think about things, the more Im convinced that the only way to be happy right now is to pump myself up on drugs. Im a 20 year old mechanical engineering student starting his second year soon. I tried to kill myself twice over seeing my friends in better positions than me, and I dont think Ill be able to secure a job that gives me enough money to try all the things I want. Im not graduating from an Ivy League, Im not a doctor either, so I wont make enough to travel the world and do the stuff that Instagram and Reddit always puts on my feed. Even if I manage to win the lottery or something, I know nothing compares to the ideals that I make up in my head. Nothing on this earth looks fun or interesting anymore. I just wish I can jump into games or books and live my life there where anything is possible, but here, you dont expect aliens to take you to worlds beyond your imaginations, superpowers, or to save the world. The way I see it, Ill just be working my ass off with the occasional vacation until the day I decide to kill myself. Because of that, Im not motivated to try hard enough because I know everything is second best to my expectations. Whats the point of trying if you cant get what you truly want in the end, just a consolation prize? Its a vicious cycle, and I feel like a car running on an empty tank when Im not working for myself, but just for external reasons like not wanting to fucking starve when I graduate. Im ready to leave this fucking earth if I know nothing makes me happy anymore. Ive learned from my past two attempts, and I think the next one will finally work.",

The problem with telling them I dont want to go this semester is I have to have a good reason and Id rather not lie to them.

I wasnt able to complete homework because of mental fog and everytime I opened my online class dashboard I would break down and cry until I fell asleep. I did a few assignments and it would take me half the day to write a 2 page paper. Took me a week to write a 6 page paper. I used to be able to do them in a few hours. I feel like my mind is deteriorating. Conversation is more difficult. I can easily explain my feelings because its a trait of my personality, but casual talk and reading people has become impossible. Im getting anxious because talking to people I already know is starting to feel like talking to strangers. Ive been crying my eyes out over small insecurities I used to be over and accept. Im trying to figure out how to reorganize my life but its so hard. I know people who go out and party and drink night after night and still go to college and go to work and are doing great. They are happy and healthy and only have a small nagging guilt about not getting more done. I feel like I produce NOTHING of value to the world and its so difficult to just chip away at learning a song or doing a simple assignment or task at work. All I can listen to is super depressing music as well if I want to enjoy it. I feel like a emo highschooler. My whole life Ive struggled with motivation, my parents called me a lazy piece of shit everyday and its true. Everything takes so much mental effort for me and I can barely focus because my mind goes a million miles an hour with intense imagery and nonsensical logic. To slow it down and focus on the world around me, especially the physical world, is a manual effort. The depression just makes it all the worse.

And I know it sounds like Im being rude, but I really want to know. Long story short, Ive been in college for a few years with worsening depression. Its likely that Im going to take a leave of absence because its become painfully clear to me that I cant handle school. I dont want to leave school, but I made exactly zero progress towards my degree this semester and its a massive waste of money to stay in school at my current mental state. Im in the middle of trying a new antidepressant my sixth in about three years and my current plan is to move home for the upcoming semester so that I have time to figure out treatment because trying a new antidepressant takes like three months and if this medication isnt the one, then thats another quarter of the year down the drain. But Ive been trying to figure out what Ill do with all my time and... I find myself drawing a blank. Sure, Ill be trying medications and going to therapy, but thatll take a couple hours per week at the absolute maximum. I can try to exercise, but again, thats maybe an hour out of my day if I can find the energy to do it. The rest of the time, I have absolutely no idea what to do other than watch Netflix and YouTube and go on Reddit, all things which I know are bad for my mental health and make me feel even more like I have no sense of purpose. I dont think I can handle getting a job maybe on a parttime basis, but Im not sure if I can deal with even that. My family has dogs, so Ill take care of them, but still, I anticipate having hours and hours of time in which I have to entertain myself alone. tldr Im going to leave school temporarily, but I dont know what Ill do with all my time other than mindlessly browse the Internet. For those of you who dont go to school or work, what do you do with your day? What gives you a sense of structure and purpose?",
    "Too much to handle She constantly feels entitled to just barge into my room to deliver twohour lectures about how she knows whats best for me, and how I should become the ideal daughter that she pictures in her head  a socially awkward, terrible at communicating, familyoriented yes woman, without any inclination towards her career and even if so, abysmally little interest must be exhibited. First of all, what a hypocritical thing to believe for a woman whod been to several countries for work, and secondly, why wouldnt she try to put herself in my shoes FOR ONCE? She ruined my life by forcing me to join a terrible college, despite me getting accepted into better ones  she blackmailed me by playing a whole bunch of cards  my fathers hard work card, my life will get ruined if I dont obey her card, Im only doing good for you card, and what not  just so she could persuade my dad to buy a new apartment in some random suburb village area. Then came her tantrums to move into the suburb, despite owning a good enough home pretty much within the city. She had absolutely no logical reasons to move, and the only backup she had were her delusions and the curses she hurled at me . Needless to say, she won again all I asked from her was two years of time for me to move away from her and leave her to her muchwanted peace from me by graduating from college. She has bad blood and beef with almost all of her and dads relatives, and the only backup she has is her father, who is a much more aggressive despot, who always thinks hes right, and others esp who are younger and financially more unstabledependent do not have a right to question the decisions he imposed on their lives. My father is said to have been a compulsive liar in the past, and he seems to have reformed now, but he feels incredibly helpless in this situation, despite this suburb house being his property. This quarantine has made the situation pretty much worse, and I really want out, but I dont know whom to go to and seek help from.",
    "Who contacts first? So my crush who I had a thing with for over a year, I guess kinda an ex. broke things off saying they werent interested and needed time for themselves. Basic stuff. Now idk if it was their really bad depression that pushed me away or them genuinely losing interest. Either way we talked for a bit after, then I started kind of going no contact... Im wondering if that was maybe a bad idea. I mean I figure if they cared they would reach out? But if theyre really depressed, even if they missed me or whatever would they take the no contact as rejection or that Im not interested and not say anything at all? Long term Id like to date them, I mean we kind of basically did before... so Im not interested in being friend zoned, but I also dont want to hurt them. People say just be honest to them and tell them how you feel etc. and I get that but A. Pouring out your feelings isnt attractive if theyve lost interest B. Isnt productive if the goal is to get back together imo. Idk, any thoughts? I care about her so much, we had a good thing, and when it ended it was on friendly terms",
    "I'm tired of my lack of motivation Hi, first post here, so Idk if the flair is right and if I will be able to put in words my feelings. Anyways, Ill give it a try, so sorry for the long post. Since the beggining of the quarantine I came to live with my boyfriend bc I know if I didnt see him often I would lose my mind and terrible things might happen. My college is trying to transform our courses in online courses, and is mainly succeeding. In the beggining I sort out everything I should do, to not leave everything to the last minute, so in the first weeks I worked like crazy and managed to anticipate the majority of my tasks. This leads me to last week. Last week I confirmed through my professors and schedules that I was ahead of almost everything. I read most of the texts, wrote most essays, made almost everything that I could do. I had almost no day to just relax or do only minor chores. So when I took my bullet journal to schedule last week and this current one, I saw that if I did one task per day I would be free to read my book and be concerned with other things, since college stuff would be done. So I distributed one task for each day untill the end of this week. But I CANT DO THEM! It is driving me crazy because it is only one simple task I must do that day, but I cant find ANY motivation to do them and now theyre accumulating! Im getting mad at myself because its just one stupid task! And I cant do it! And this lack of motivation is affecting other things. I cant wake up early to do my exercises anymore, I cant be happy doing lunch I loved to cook, but now its just an obligation, even my games and my books dont make me happy anymore! Im in a constant state of apathy and I hate this! And now Im concerned that because of this my boyfriend will think that Im just not happy around him bc of him, and thats not the problem at all. Sorry for the long post and thank you in advance for hearing me. I would really appreciate some support words.",
    "Depression and Anxiety firing up and causing me to feel like I might have a panic attack. So this may just be the anxiety firing up and causing me to stress and panic. Ive had trouble in the past with lonliness, both my parents have kicked me out Because of me wanting a better job, and Ive had friends in the past all of a sudden drop me or stop talking to me frequently, this left me feeling alone quite alot of the time and causing me to worry about upsetting any friends I do make. I managed to make about 3 friends that I talked to regularly, one of those friends started being really horrible, majority of the time to me and I started to get fed up of it. I called him out on it and this has resulted in me and that guy Call him Ed not being friends, however wed end up in the same rooms chatting on discord because of me being friends with the two other friends, A and B, and Ed joining occasionally. Well recently Ed and B have started chatting more and more often and A and me talking more, however in recent rooms, me and Ed have started arguing because of the way he still tries to treat me, B has recently started acting slightly more like Ed as well, which is causing me concern and ended up with me and B having a small argument earlier today. My anxiety is spiking however because, B is talking less and less to me, and now A has started to disappear a bit more, I worry that I will end up lonely again, without anyone to talk to, as it took me over a year to make these friends after the last group of friends I had all left in one big hit. I bring all this up because the last time I ended up feeling like this and lost everyone I considered a friend, I nearly hurt myself quite badly... And I worry about doing that again.",
    "I hate how bad I am at art, but I don't know what to do about it. Hi, so Im an amateur artist like REALLY amateur, my art skills suck and despite trying for over a decade I cant seem to improve. Art has always been a passion of mine, as well as something I genuinely enjoy doing on the extremely rare occasion that I manage to produce a slightlylesssthanusual drawing at least so feeling like my art is stuck at the subdeviantart level has made me incredibly frustrated and is probably the leading contributor to my depression. Its getting to the point that Im beginning to wonder if I should force myself to avoid art in general just to keep the selfhatred at bay. The problem is that I dont know WTF Im supposed to do about it. I tried to ignore it for a couple years, tried to tell myself art was just a phase and I wasnt into it anymore, but that didnt work. Ive tried multiple methods of improvement Ive taken both private instruction and community college classes, but I seem to have terrible luck as theyve all been pretty crap. I feel like Ive exhausted all of my options. I havent tried online classes, but judging by the reviews Ive read for places like Udemy and Skillshare I doubt theyd be any better. Ive tried looking for tips online, but all I get is basically the artist equivalent of git gud. It seems like the only option I have left is just practice nonstop for the 20 years and hope I magically improve Saitamastyle. Unfortunately, I just dont think I can do that. Ive had so many setbacks and failures in my life that I genuinely dont think I have the patience to wait until Im in my mid40s before Im halfway decent at drawing. Even worse, the fact that Im colorblind and extremely nearsighted as well as lacking whatever Matrixvision lets you visualize an object as brush strokes and color values makes me wonder if practice would even do me any good at all. Anyways, Ive rambled too much. TLDR  I suck at art, I dont know how to not suck at art, and this makes me really fing depressed.",
    "hi, i don't know what to say but here it is. okay, so well i think i have depression or not I dont know I am just confused and numb and sad all the time. I have a very loving family and I tried talking to them but they dont seem to understand they are trying but they cant  dadintj, momestj, grandma estj I have good relationships with all of them but they cant get around my mental health. They are already very stressed I cant stress them anymore and I am actually ashamed and embarrassed of talking to them about this. I have a intp cousin she knows me well and is a loving sister but her life is already very shity and i cant bring myself to talk to her out of guilt. I consider myself as a very privileged person and by that I mean that I have a loving family a secure house food on my plate clean water and just I have everything better than everyone around me and I just feel like a burden and failure everyone is trying so hard for me I dont even know what I am depressed about... I sometimes fear that I am making this all up and that my subconscious is telling me t do this for attention... i am sick of worrying people I care about. I need professional help and i know that but it is complicated. I just keep having meltdowns and just feel like someone is always constantly standing on my chest . I just feel like I am becoming a ungrateful unhumble piece of shit who does nothing but complain and become a burden or pain in someones life. I wont lie I think about dying a lot awful lot but I know I wont commit suicide as I have a strict code of conduct and my morals dont allow me to commit suicide unless it is to save a innocent person.

    "Does this qualify as depression? Recently a pattern in my behavior has become very clear to me. Whenever I dont have a structure in my schedule to keep me busy, out of the house, and socializing, I begin to fall apart. My hygiene suffers, I sometimes go a week without showering or brushing my teeth. The amount of dry shampoo I use is scary. I always end up binging, with food and television. I was doing great all summer with a healthy diet, exercising, losing weight. Then my summer job ended. Now I spend the majority of my time watching show after show and mindlessly eating while I do it. Whenever im alone in the house and not distracting myself with food, tv, or porn I just end up pacing around, staring out the window melancholically like a antidepressant tv ad. Ive had a therapy consultation at my college where we primarily discussed my potentially having ADHD and my struggles with feeling guilty about my academic underperformance. I mightve gotten to talking about whether Im depressed, but I never actually had a session, they were booked until the end of the year. Im just looking for some answers, thinking about trying to find a therapist, but the only local source has had many questionable testimonials.",
    "I wrote my letters To start it am safe, I am not planning on ending my life for now. I wrote my letters today. I wanted to see what I would say to my loved ones. They were surprisingly easy to write. 5 total. My exwife, 2 friends and my parents. The ones to my parents were the hardest. I know they are what had kept me alive as long as I have been. I dont want them to have to bury me. That is not a burden I want them to have. But having these letters written does give me some relief in knowing that if I cant hold back the pain anymore that they will know that I did my best and that they were wonderful parents. And that it was not because of them I am gone. That it was because of them I lived as long as I did. That my pain became too much but not because if them. It was my internal demons. So they will know that I held out as long as I could. so I have to keep going for now. So they will never see that letter. But knowing it is there if I cant keep it away in the future is a relief.",
    "I don’t know what is happening First of all, hello everyone and thank you for taking the time to read this. Ive been dealing with a lot of stuff recently and I think Ive done pretty good in regards how to deal with it but I still need some additional inspiration andor advice or you know, just someone who will listen because my friends have been listening to this a lot and I dont want to burden them with this any further. I was dating a guy from January until pretty recently and we were always on the brink of getting serious when he decided to distance himself from me because I think he was scared or something I dont blame him then in may I found out that I was pregnant 4w  3 d when I found out and I told him. He got extremely angry when I told him and that resulted in us having this really bad argument over if I should keep the baby or not and I was not budging because I thought it was in my best interest to keep the baby but then one thing led to another and I had a miscarriage the same day as I told him about the pregnancy and he seemed relieved that I had the miscarriage. But then yesterday I told him that I had to stop seeing him because I met a guy who treats me better and what not I hadnt talked to the guy I had been seeing for a few weeks so I assumed that it was over and he decides to tell me that he loves me he worded it like this even though its not in that way I love you and really care about you and I told him that I love him as a friend and that I really care about him too, later on he proceeded to tell me that he regrets how he acted towards me when I was pregnant and he now sees that we could have coparented well and that he wishes things wouldnt have happened like they did. I dont know how to feel about this because when he brought up the miscarriage I started to feel like I did when it happened because I still want that baby even though its gone and I know I can never get it back. Is it weird that I still want to be pregnant and is it weird that this chat of ours brought back the feelings that I had previously suppressed towards him?",
    "Should I use the psychological help service that my university provides for free? Lately Ive been feeling really low. I cant make myself leave the bed, I start crying out of the blue and everything is just so heavy. I think Ive always suffered from some kind of depression but Ive never been to therapy because I couldnt afford it on my own and my family didnt ever suspect anything. Now I live on my own in another city. Yesterday I discovered that my university provides psychological help for students for free. Do you think I should give it a go? Im a bit afraid because I dont know what to expect and I dont really know what to tell them when Ill be there. I know they dont provide help for very serious issues youll need a psychiatrist for that and I hope they dont take care for only university related problems. On the other hand, I have nothing to lose because its free. Did you ever try anything like that?",

    "I'm so tired I remember the next day where during all of class I lied in bed, not saying a word to the friends I usually talk to all day, it just all felt so hopeless. That night I remember asking my mom to look into therapy again then went upstairs and lied on the floor of my room for a half hour crying and trying to vent out what I was feeling, but everytime I talked about it I was too scared to fully explain to my friends, leaving it coming off as a student wanting to be lazy rather than sheer hopelessness and a severe lack of any will to keep living they it really was. I took the AP exam yesterday on my birthday, it was fine enough but left me wondering why I even did that, why did I go through all that stress and mental fatigue to look kind of good for colleges? I was tired, tired and done with dealing with this. So here I am a year later, lying in bed with no will or motivation to do anything else. Behind on my school work, and vastly unprepared for an SAT coming up in a few days, just wondering when will it be better. I dont want any of this anymore, I just want to sleep, Im so tired of everything, Ive been burnt out for months with no end in sight, why wont I feel better? I have a test for my drivers license coming up next week too, which cause me to again spiral and type all this, when does it end? Will I ever be just content with life? Im tired of it all, why wont it get better? When will it end? Is there even a way to cope anymore?",

I thought Im never going to talk to anyone ever about it again Now I keep having thoughts and I am honestly scared I will do something.. I have no one to turn to.

    "How to stop crying all the time? Hi there, TLDR  I cry so much and not sure how to calm myself down enough to not cry. Im not always even sure why i am crying, it just starts running down my face. Im on month 7 of my current severe depressive episode. My bipolar causes me to have usually 6 months of depression every year, but this time it feels worse than in many years, and also its just getting worse despite having lasted quite a while for my usual pattern. Im considered treatment resistant with meds, though about to try out a 13th or 14th new medication. Im also struggling to access adequate support. I am crying every day recently, today being particularly bad. Ive had 4 or 5 bouts of crying since I got up about 5 hours ago. Nothing has actually happened today, so I dont know why. Im tired of this. Id love some ideas on how I can find some more calm. I do yoga in the evenings, but its a recent thing and I probably have to do it for a while to see improvements. On a positive note, I handed in all the medications I no longer take to the pharmacy for safe disposal yesterday. This makes me a lot safer in terms of suicide risk, and whilst it makes me quite anxious not to have it as an option in the back of my head, I know it was the right thing to do. I dont have any pills that could kill me in an overdose now.",
    "Ungluing myself from my bed Im someone who spends around 16 hours a days on my bed. I sleep there, sometimes eat there, sometimes study there, most things I do are done on the bed. Whats important is it needs to be seen as a place of sleep, and it limits what I do. I want to be asleep and awake at sensible times. I unhealthily use my phone in my bed for things I probably find boring, like a zombie, too the point where I still use it when I get tired. I want to make sitting down attractive, or standing attractive, or walking attractive, or I want to make living on my bed feel unattractive. I do have ideas on how, but Id like to hear other peoples ideas and thoughts. In my room is my desk and chair, my bed, and my floor. I also have sofas in my shared kitchen, with a TV, and 3 flatmates, though Im hesitant to interact with them. And, I obviously have the outside world. The things Ive tried is buying a cushion for my chair, and using one of those hand resistance things thats just a tool for fiddling that cant really be conveniently used in bed while on my phone. I was thinking of getting some PC games that Id be able to run smoothly on my lowperforming laptop, or investing in a Nintendo Switch, as I know that Im spending most of my freetime doing things I dont find enjoyable and I like playing Smash Ultimate.

    "I feel my life is worthless, I'm ready to end it all, please help me. I've posted for help, and I don't know where to turn to now. I feel more depressed now than ever before in my life. It became like an addiction to me. For weeks upon weeks Id go to different nightclubs, and bar hop night after night after work, I didnt just savior my time there I indulged in it, there Id hook up with women looking for more than just fun. For some reason during this time I was able to hook up with a few local black chicks thatd be hitting the club scene, never in my life did I ever think I as a blond ass kid from Pensacola would I be hooking up like this, most of the times after drinking, and chatting with them, wed hang out in my car, and have some fun in a parking lot wed drive to, and spend a few hours at, during this time Id never use protection, maybe it was the combination of being drunk, or dazed but at that time I just didnt care. During this time I met this hot black chick with an afro, well call her Mandy, and after dancing with her at a nightclub late one night we really hit it off, but after my typical one night stand, this girl was different. We grew to have a connection, as days went by we started getting flirty over texts, and soon I grew to have a secret relationship with her, while my wife knew nothing about it. I even took several business trips to her place during this time. Every time I went it was well worth it. At first she was very sweet to me, and considerate, we even smoked pot together, which for me was a first. Finally for once in my life I thought I had found the perfect work life, sex balance. Id wake up, say bye to the kids, go to work, afterwards let loose at the clubs till 3am, come back while the wife is asleep, and so on. And finally with Mandy in the mix, I had someone to actually connect to when I wanted. Unlike my wife she was in her early 20s, my wife late 40s, Ive seen garbage fires that look better than her.",
    "No One Cares So Why Should I? I am not great with conveying my thoughts but Ill try. I feel like no one cares whatsoever. All of my friends have others to hang out with, and honestly they probably enjoy each other more than being with me. On top of this, I dont really know how to tell people Im not doing well for a few reasons. I always seem to get short responses like itll get better or Oh and then its left at that. No one knows how to help me, which is fair I suppose, but after so many cries for help, Ive given up. No one knows how to help and surely it must upset or annoy them hearing about me having a bad time, so I decided to lie. I dont tell anyone how Im really feeling except on rare occasions. Even then, its not usually helped. Im so useless to everyone by being this way, so instead Id rather put on a mask and fake happiness, that way no one has to bother. I dont care about myself, I just want others to be happy and if that means ignorance then thats fine I suppose. I dont think anyone should do this, but I dont carry the same standards for myself as I do others. Im sure itll be bad but I just dont know what else I could do. I wish I could just be better but its impossible. Everything hurts in my heart so much that sometimes it makes me nauseous. I cant stand living around people who barely notice me. I allow myself to get used to make others happy. I hate it, but Ive decided its logical if it makes others happy. Instead of two people hurting, I just do, all the time. In this sense, Im like a doll. Im used for whatever purpose and then discarded afterwards. It hurts so bad, but I dont know anything else. Im worried about asking for help since I feel like I disappoint others when I cant tell them whats wrong, or if what they say or suggest doesnt help. I dont know what I need honestly.

The trouble is Ive been battling post partum anxiety and depression since i had my last little one. So just a little more than 2 years. My depression had improved greatly in the last few months but recently its been fluctuating again I was sick for 2 weeks and now my kids are both sick as well as my roommate this has made things very difficult and Ive had a lot of health problems at the end of last year that made it difficult to get important things done. Well, now Ive reached a point where I have zero motivation. I just feel so overwhelmed by everything I have to get done and even making a to do list, and today sending it to my LDR partner with the idea that he will check at the end of the day to see how much I accomplished has done nothing except make me feel more depressed and anxious. Im having trouble thinking, Ive stopped eating properly and making sure to drink water every day my SO has been helping to encourage me to do these things properly and Im just having trouble making myself focus and chill out enough to get things done. Today I was going to do things... but then I had kids screaming and crying all day and I couldnt do hardly anything. Now its the end of the day, Ive managed to eat and drink water today more water than usual but not enough yet and Im just feeling really sick again.

This was the day lockdown was put in place uk this incident was a catalyst for a downward spiral and Im now in a depressive episode. I have work due in under a week and I cant force myself to do it. If I dont submit I will not be able to get my degree. Im tired and experiencing some really bad thoughts. I cant talk to anyone irl about this apart from my therapist but my appointment isnt for another week. I dont really know what Im expecting from this but putting it out there and helps sometimes. So here I am, doing that, I guess.",
    "Its all my parents fault i am well aware that people are the product of their environments but what the fuck. I totally get the reasons why people are the way that they are but if you know you are not parent material why the fuck would you have children, it doesnt make any fucking sense. I was doing alright for a while now, but shit happened and the suicidal feelings are coming back again. And the funniest part is that they actually expect me to stay alive for them? What the actual fuck is this? Suicide is not selfish, because the act of bringing me into this world is selfish. Who the fuck asked for life? Not me, nor do i want it. And expecting me to live and like my life when biologically im fucked is the most selfish thing ive ever heard.ugh am i just being an immature brat or it is justifiable for me to feel this way?",
    "Breaking up gave me depression.. and I want to speak my mind.. please be nice. Eventually, she broke it off in December 2019. Moving on to January, I moved to a new country, a new city, a new environment, and things seemed like everything was fresh. I had the fresh start that I was craving for. But things didnt go as well as I expected. I got depressed, alone and so far away? I didnt have anyone to open up to, and a PHYSICAL connection with anyone. I did not have any friends in this new country. I started to open up a habit that I have locked away a long time ago, I started cutting. I cut myself when I was a kid so that my parents would notice, and signal to them that Im not ok. But this time, I cut myself in a place where no one could ever see, my shoulders. So whats my motive? The motive was weird, but it worked. First of all, it calmed me in the midst of an anxiety attack. It took all the anxiety away in an instant. Secondly, If I was a selfharmer, then no one will ever accept me for the person I am. I know Im wrong, but it worked. Yes, I was lying to myself, but at least I was not stressing on why I did not have friends like other teenagers. As if I was forced to live alone because of my lifestyle. It was my sanctuary for a month, my cuts started to get deeper. I woke up one day and realized how badly scarred my shoulder was. My bedsheets were constantly covered in blood, my pillow, my trashcan is filled with blooded tissues. At a point, my cuts werent healing properly because I would cut across the cuts and left nasty scars on my shoulder. I couldnt continue. Even though It helped me, I dont want these scars to stay forever. I needed to stop before its too late. So, I stopped hurting myself only for the fear of creating new scars. I turned to religion for answers, I have been blessed to receive answers, I know 100 that this is all going to blow over, and the sun will shine on me once more.",
    "What is wrong with me This is a very long post and Im sorry for that. I just hope someone reads it and gives me their honest opinion. I also hope this is the right place for it, if not then, Ill keep this to myself. Thank you all. Hi, Im a nurse student in Germany and Im currently trying to learn for my exam thats in about a month, while trying to find a job at a hospital. not always, but a lot of the elderly I work with call me the nice sister Im not an examined nurse yet, and I also dont compare myself with one, but elderly call almost every female worker a sister. I didnt quiet leave a good impression at every unit i worked at, some told me that I should work on my structure, some told me that I need to smile more because my face always looks angry, and some told me that I should apply for a job at their unit because they thought I was good. I did apply, wasnt really confident that Im good at all but i tried my best to seem confident, because I figured that no one would want to hire someone thats not confident. I applied to meet someone thats known to be very nice and that would talk to students for at least 10 minutes and then offer them a job, but I was unlucky enough to have a meeting with someone else, Mrs. D. My meeting didnt go that well, she asked me a lot of trick questions and lasted for over 45 minutes, she also asked the why should we hire you and not someone else question 4 times because she didnt like my answer, come to think of it, I dont think I answered the question at all and talked instead about what this job meant for me. at the end she told me shed talk to my teacher and the units Ive been at, and give me a call soon. fast forward one month later, which was yesterday. I was invited to her office midshift. she sat me down at a table 2 meters away from her and said we could take off the face masks. then she offered me a limited contract for 6 months and called it my second chance, proceeded to tell me that the units didnt say good things about me and then told me that Im empathyless and that people arent machines or objects.",

    "My confidence has declined well within the negatives. I dont quite know if I should fully go into every detail or not. But here goes. Im so unbelievably inconfident and depressed that nothing, nothing gets through to me. Not a single compliment, not a single word of positivity gets through into my mind. And I feel so utterly lost, I keep losing friends and I keep having to get dumped by my partners. Ive frankly had enough of this nightmare and I wish I could just escape.

I tried being more productive, and I still am, but its still just complete and utter misery. What am I supposed to do? Ive got no therapist to help me for another 2 months or so, and I doubt theyll be able to help, not a single therapist in my life has. I feel drained, empty and worthless, if I wasnt scared or fearful, Id be dead. I do feel highly suicidal, but Im too weak of a person to actually go through with it.

Im 19 almost 20 and i feel like Ive accomplishment nothing in life at all. My story is the following. I was born in Mexico to a single mother and brought to the US when i was one year old. My mom got married to this man and every since I have memory this man has treated me terribly. Ive been told that he treated me well I was a baby but I dont remember any of it. I used to be beaten almost everyday by this man and its left scars in my mental state. He would beat me for the most absurd things. He beat me because i didnt all my multiplications, he beat me because I couldnt hold a chicken while he killed the poor thing, he beat me because I wasnt strong enough to help him do some mechanic things. He would tell me that I was useless and worthless. This has left a pretty big scar. And the worst thing of all is that mom wouldnt do anything and i didnt know why. I thought everyone just hated me. I just want someone to tell me that they are proud of me.

    "First time in forever. Hi. Hope everyone is well. Recently Ive been diagnosed with manic depression disorder and anxiety disorder at the age of 18. I think Ive always known Id be struggling ever since I was about 15. Just a little context, 2020 was a weird year. I started off having the worst manic episode ever to a point where I lost 4 stones, considering i was already skinny. Then i got back on my feet, I was eating healthy and working out and even enjoying the air. Some things happened during that summer that traumatised my brain. It put me in a bad place as I went to college and was not enjoying it at all. Im already seeing a therapist and its helped but it never feels like it majorly helped, it just feels like someone there to talk to. Now im here, with failed relationships in my family, no friends, horrible sleep pattern and constant pain. for the first time I feel hopeless. How do you recommend I get out of this lump and state that I cant even get up to go get my prescription? For the first time in forever I genuinely believe I cant help myself and i feel stuck. What do i do?",

The city I go to college in is ugly and amplifies my depression ten fold.

I dont feel like I can handle the upcoming semester, let alone two more years of this. Never got suicidal thoughts until I started living there Milwaukee. People tell me to keep my chin up and just look at the bright side of things, but its impossible. Everything makes me so unhappy. I really really want to just skip out on the bachelors, but it would disappoint my parents and myself, admittedly. I dont know what to do to balance out all the despair. Things im already doingabout to start doing listed below, suggestions very welcome  exercising with ring fit about to, just got the game  playing switch games figured itd make me happier to finally buy a switch  spending a lot of time with my friends  painting and sculpting  drawing  roleplaying  cooking sometimes What are more things I can do?",

    "Life’s going downhill and everything that happens is mainly my fault I beg to them not to as it obviously makes her uncomfortable but they wont stop, my sin wont leave me, no matter what I do. Its still on my back, and this one kid wont leave me alone about it, and he antagonizes me about it. The sad truth is that I cant blame anyone. It was my fault, I shouldnt of said that. Ironically the week after this happened our school got a presentation on cyber safety. My last issue, and arguably the one that makes me sad and angry, are my friends. I dont think its their fault. I believe its just mine for acting stupid and making so many horrible choices, so I cant blame them. But they never have anything good to say about me. Ever since kindergarten, I was constantly being reminded of how stupid and idiotic I was. Now they wont leave me alone for how much of a disappointment I am, how Im stupid, and they constantly make fun of me and wont leave me alone for my mistakes, as well as making up lies. Hell, one friend is calling me a pedophilia because I like Asian girls and theyre shorter than me or some shit, even though the ones I sorta like are in my age group. If theres an argument on the bus, Im the main problem because I spook to loudly and disturbed everyone. If I had an argument with someone and we have a fight, they always bring up a point that makes me realize Im the wrong one. No matter how much I compliment them, they never have anything good to say back aside from my idiotic ignorance. Overall, I want to commit suicide more than anything. The thing is, I just cant being myself to because 1. Its forbidden in the Bible 2. What would my parents think? I cant just leave them. But still, regardless of all of that, I still want to end my life and go with the Lord. However, the moment I see the Lord, Im going to see the gate of hell for all my sins and what I have done. Im vulgar, perverted, violent, etc.",

I feel like Im merely existing rather than living, and I have no idea how to change it or what fo do to make it better. The only thing that keeps me from ending it is my parents.

    "My girlfriend is suffering from depression, and I’m looking for some advice on how I can be more supportive. For some context, weve been together for almost three years and a large portion of our relationship has been long distance. Shes been suffering from depression for most of her adult life and its been especially bad in recent weeks. Shes a recent college grad and is really stressed out about her future, and whether or not shes making correct decisions for her career. This causes her to feel anxiety, which in turn causes her depression to worsen and this cycle repeats. I know that I cant cure her depression, but I want to do all I can to be supportive while she figures out how best to deal with it. Recently shes been saying she doesnt feel like its fair for me to have to deal with her when shes like this, and shes worried thats its having a negative impact on our relationship. Ive never really had to deal with depression as closely as I am now, and am looking for ways to improve, or even just some advice on things to do to help. I always try to be supportive, letting her know that Im here for her and that I love her. Its been increasingly difficult for me as she often becomes withdrawn, and with the distance and our differing work schedules most of our communication is through texting.

One night, she told me that shes scared cause she feels like she is one of those girls who meant nothing to me. I told her she was insane and Im in love with her. Until one day when we were at one of my friends house and we were alone, I started making love to her. we didnt have much time so she got pissed off and told me that I was so selfish and I just wanted her for sex and left. This led to our breakup. The next few days we fought and she started flirting with other guys. I couldnt believe everything was falling apart. She told me that she loved me so much but she thinks that I dont love her so her love for me has faded away. She told me that her personality makes her want to date older guys and Ive been acting like a kid. Break can you believe age is this much important for girls in Iran? Well you cant blame them cause they have a lot of father issues, but I really didnt expect it from Jane. I couldnt believe what I heard. I was totally mature and loyal and honest about our relationship and the person who was acting like a kid was Jane the whole fucking time. But I got accused of acting like a kid. We broke up and she blocked me on everything. Its been 3 months since we broke up and it happened in the worst possible time. I couldnt hangout with my friends to ease the pain cause of quarantine. I was lonely the whole time. After quarantine was finished in Iran, I started hanging out with my friends and stuff but there is still a crushing pain deep down in my chest. And you wanna know something funny? I heard she got back together with that asshole who treated her like shit. Obviously knowing that she is this much immature made me realize I dont love her anymore. But I still miss that feeling. I miss being happy in a relationship. I miss being in love.

    "Being suicidal and scared to die So for as long as I can remember I have been depressed, I dont mean that in the oh yeah Ive been sad for a while I mean I was first formally diagnosed with clinical depression at age 6 in 1997. I like to joke that its my longest lasting relationship. So what brings me to write this post? Ive been in a horrendous depressive episode for the last 18 months over my live Ive been depressed all but 6 years, but it comes and goes in waves steadily its been getting worse and worse, becoming suicidal, secluding myself, and all the other lovely things that go with it. I want to die, I dont want to be here anymore, and before you suggest medication, Ive been on every medication for depression also multiple for anxiety and a couple antipsychotic meds too. Counselling has never worked for me, I stopped doing illicit drugs years ago stopped smoking, stopped drinking, tried exercise and diets. Yet, I still have suicidal thoughts and feelings everyday, all day, and night. I wake up sad that I have woken up. I go to sleep hoping that I have stroke or heart attack that kills me in my sleep. Ive planned my suicide so many times and in so many different ways, I have attempted suicide a few times in the past. Now to the crux of my problem, I want to die, but Im scared of actually being dead. Any thoughts or suggestions will be welcome. Thanks.",
    "The Story of This Year They are a very important part of my life and they mean the world to me. They are very honest people and they told me before moving that I shouldnt, that it wouldnt work out and that the people Im moving in with arent who I think they are and it wont work out. Me being stubborn ignored all their warnings. I have this bad habit of meeting someone and when I get along with them as well as I did with Max, I latch on and I just want to hang and spend all my time with them and it always ends up ending badly. Back to the story, I ended up moving in with these 3 people. It was bloody fantastic, I had the most amazing time with them. We would spend all night and all day talking and having fun and it really did mess with my studies and sleep. I dropped studying all together and ignored it and my insomnia got worse. On May 21st we planned on going out, we drank a whole lot and went to the club. My house mates and I decided to take MDMA which we had bought the same day. There was 2 capsules and a rock. Now Ive done drugs before, I do it recreationally, when Ive taken MDMA Ive only ever had it in capsules so I asked to have the 2 capsules just because it was familiar and I get very anxious trying new things. Well, we all took our share, went on the dance floor and thats all I remember. I woke up in hospital the next day and the doctor spoke to me about what was in my system. The capsules ended up being MDMA, ketamine and ice. My body couldnt handle the adverse reaction and basically shut down. The doctor send me home and I had the biggest come down that Ive ever had in my life. It got around that I had taken the drugs and I got into a lot of trouble, I got banned from the uni bar and I was ashamed to show my face at uni and the colleges so I actively avoided it for about a month. During this month Ive never been so miserable. I cried everyday, I never left my room, I avoided everything and everyone.",

Im a good person, a sweet girl and for whatever reason people may believe I deserve unhappiness, they dont really know me or understand the true me and how loving and giving I am! I regularly give 20 bills to homeless folks but I have people saying, You deserve it bitch. I deserve love and happiness.

    "I need help I dont know how much longer I can actually take living in this cruel world. Im constantly made fun of because I am ugly. All of my few friends have abandoned me for no reason. The only friend I had told me that I would never get a girlfriend. The fact of him telling me I wasnt going to get a girlfriend didnt bother me that much but that he was saying it in a serious voice and not a joking way. My dad just exploits me for money even though he makes over 100k a year. Every time I talk to him he just reminds me that I owe him for the car that he bought me for 1500 so I could get to work. Im only 17 btw. I just dont know what to do. Ive quit going to lunch at school because I dont have anybody to sit with. Ive somewhat stopped talking to my dad. Im just in a really bad place.",
    "Why do I even bother? I never get any replies on this subreddit, but here I am again prostrating myself to all who dare to read my post! I suffer from insomnia, migraines, chest pain, muscle pain, the list goes on and on. My body is a broken temple, and I am but nineteen years old, yet the doctors claim nothing is wrong with me. Not a day goes by when I dont consider suicide due to my physical maladies. My physical maladies are only the start! After all, according to my Psychiatrist, I have Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, ObsessiveCompulsive Disorder, and Autism. My father didnt want to raise me. I have a mother who berates me regularly and my stepfather who is an angeraddict. I dont have any friends. Ive had five jobs in the past 365 days, but none of them have worked out. Hell, I cant even figure out for gender identity or sexual orientation for crying out loud! I know someone is going to tell me to go see a therapist and a doctor, but all I can say is that I do. It doesnt matter. Im broken. I expect to die of esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, or some other such terminal disease. Life has lost all its meaning. I would rather be dead that going through all this suffering. And nobody seems to ever read my posts, and if they do, they write insulting replies. I am worse than Hitler and Stalin combined. I dont even know what Im saying anymore. Im going to take some medication to gain me three or four hours of sleep. I know nobody will read this, so who cares? Pizza! Pineapple! Carl Jung! Dead babies! Quantum Mechanics!",

Everyone I talk to I just cant connect with and I just feel like they dont like me or care about me or anything I have to do with. I dont do anything to make people hate me I just put it in my head and it begins to spread into the relationship with people. My co workers who say they are my friends say they care about me but when they see that Im in a depressed mood they dont do anything. I just feel like they are only in my life because of work. I have been thinking in my head every day that the world would be a better place if I werent in it people would just be happier to not have to deal with me. I even go to the point where I will make up reasons or find reasons to prove my point, even if Im taking to a wrong way. I do this in every situation and just keep telling myself people dont care about me and ride the proof to make it true. It makes me feel like The world would be better off with out me.",
    "Thank you for reading. Hey, I dont know if anyone is going to read this or not, but if you do, thank you. I havent been on a date in two years, been intimate with someone in 3, I know that doesnt matter and it doesnt matter to me that much. But it feels nice to be attracted to in some way. Every single girl in the past two years has ghosted me. Every. Single. One. I tried paying for tinder, paying for match, paying for bumble, and clover. Tinder is kind of a joke but Im just saying I tried them all. I went out and tried to meet people in bars, games, events. Ive had a woman look me up and down and say ew and walk away after I tried to talk to her. I dont know, the biggest thing I want in life is a loving wife and beautiful children. And I may only be 22 but I want that long relationship where there is nothing but love, started at a young age. I dont want to be 50 finding my soulmate. But nowadays people see one thing they dont like about you and they just assume the relationship will never work. Ive lost several friends this year because of how things have changed. My friends also ended up trying to make plans without me and hide the fact they were hanging out, most of the time it was because they wanted to smoke, and I dont. And my work has me travel, often, and for at least a few weeks at a time several states away and I cant go out and spend time with friends or family, because I dont know anyone and there arent any coworkers nearby because they usually send me to areas where they have no one. And it just amplifies the depression and started to develop insomnia because of my depression and having a hard time trying to fall asleep in a hotel room.",

    "Advice on personal hygiene/self care Hi everyone! This is my first post on reddit so please forgive me if I dont do this right p Ive struggled with severe depression for about 12 years or so now, and lately it seems to be getting worse. Its gotten to a point where I dont have motivation to do the most basic of things  such as showering daily, brushing my hair, even brushing my teeth... its incredibly embarrassing, but I just cant find it in myself to care. I used to put a lot of effort into my appearance, and I took pride in how I presented myself. Now though, I feel as if its pointless. I feel like the way I present myself currently is an accurate portrayal of how I feel inside. Does anyone have any advice on how to change this, or how to find motivation, or anything at all? Id greatly appreciate any ideas on how I could improve on this. I feel ashamed when I show up to work in the same outfit, or with my hair in a tangled bun because I couldnt be bothered to brush it. Not ashamed enough to change though, I guess. Thank you in advance for any responses, and thank you for taking the time to read this",

    "I feel lonely even though there's no need to Last time she cancelled the plan nearly two weeks ago and I havent heard from her since. I have social anxiety and even though that got a lot better during the last years it can still be an awful big challenge for me to message someone on my own especially if I really care about that person. In these cases I can overcome myself after some time but it seems to be me doing the work way too often. Something you got to know is that Im someone who likes to live for the good of others. I love to do stuff for my friends and make them happy. When my friends are happy, so am I. But obviously in a friendship theres always two parts. All I would want is an occasionally message from these people who are so important to me. Just a simple thing that makes me realize that at least in that very moment I was in their thoughts. Show me that you thought of me and Im the happiest person. But leave me in the dark for weeks and I fall into a big hole. Worst thing is that there are so many people who talk to me daily and who show that they care about me daily. And even though Im surrounded by so many people close to me I still feel lonely simply because the desire in my heart for these other friends have a whole different weight. I feel bad to feel lonely because I have no need to. Because I know that there are many people who would love to have what I do. Im a very emotional person and I can hardly cope with pain like this. Sometimes I ask them why we dont message each other more often. And days after that we do, but then it stops again. Then it feels like they only did it because I asked them to. So I practically did the work again and it thus it makes me feel worse than before. Obviously I know that we arent as close as we once were. I know that they are probably busy with life Im unemployed so Im trapped with my thoughts very often and that they have other people closer to them who they probably rather spend time with. But I dont see how it is hard work to think about my friends at least once in some weeks.",

Honest mistake I think tell me if Im wrong please!. She got frustrated and lashes out. Essentially calling into question me as a man and as a cook. bottom line was I got hurt and ended up crying. Now this worries me for a few reasons. The last time I was too sensitive about being insulted was around the time I had a breakdown. Basically it felt like my emotions were sunburned and any little negative comment pushed me over. Also those kinds of things attacking my manhood and pretty much anything negative about me has been a sort of depression mantra when Im upset lots of negative thoughts rolling out at once. My question is this is it possible Im too easily triggered? Or maybe the particular subject matter was a significant trigger? Or maybe am I just a wuss and therefore not much of a man?",
    "My depressed partner drains me tldr My partner has been depressed and not knowing what to do with his life for a long time. I am the only person he relys on for support and I cant bear it any longer. It starts to severely affect my own life quality and happiness. I 30f met my partner 32m at university eight years ago. He was a very fun, open and active guy with a huge social group. After two years of being friends we started dating. It was around that time that he was done with all his courses and papers and the only thing left for him to finish uni was to write his bachelors thesis. That didnt happen for another four years. Within that time he basically didnt do anything. Didnt write his thesis, didnt get a job. He told me, that he had no clue, what he wants to do with his life and I tried to encourage him to just do some internships to figure that out, but he never did. He is fortunate enough that his parents pay for his expenses always did and still do, so money wouldnt be the problem. He never did any internship. Fast forward six years and the situation is still the same. He did eventually finish his bachelors and started a masters degree but realized that studying just isnt for him. However he still isnt properly searching for jobs or internships or general input that would help him figure out, what he wants to do or be. The thing is, that his self esteem is lower than the mariana trench. He feels like he doenst know anything and is underqualified for basically every job. Hes not. Hes incredibly smart, attentive and detail orientated and has a great passion for social justice but he keeps telling himself that he isnt enough for any job and he doenst dare to apply. I dont know how to help him. All my affirmations seem to not penetrate his mindfog. However, the problem is that Im the only one hes talking to. Because he realized that all his peers moved on he stopped having contact with them because he was embarassed. So here is the thing.",

This includes my grandparents, aunts, etc. I was homeless with my mother, living in a car for the first 6 years of my life. Id had it by the time I was 13. I was never home, would stay at friends houses for weeks at a time, wander the streets, because going home was torture. Constant violence, fighting, yelling and neglect, with police constantly showing up at the house. My family never fed me, and I basically had to beg friends for food. At 13, I started using drugs because I was finally accepted by my friend group. I was constantly high, and everyone in school warned people to stay away from me. I was in and out of juvy, and literally the cops arrested me in the middle of class when I was 17, and I was expelled. My family disowned me, and my aunt was kind enough to let me stay with her until I was 18. It was the greatest act of kindness Ive ever known. At age 16, my met my first gf, and I jumped headfirst. I was wholeheartedly convinced she was the woman I was going to marry.",

You only hear from them when YOU initiate contact. I guess im just wondering if anyone else has a fear of being forgotten. I spent so much time nurturing and cultivating these relationships but ultimately...you cant keep it alive on your own. It has to be a mutual effort. And thats what kills me....being the only one that cares. Its always been this way. Being the only one that misses people. People who probably have never even had a passing thought about you.

This was the ONLY personalized meeting I have had in this program  everything else was groups or front desk people doing questionnaires. 4 I have had no meeting with anyone during or before the program regarding what I need or how this program is customized to me. 5 almost every individual in the program is on medication and there seems to be general push towards strong sedating medication. Most members could not even sit up during groups due to the level of sedation. 6 I have corrected the clinicians and staff over 4 times in a single day with the name they use for me and they continue to use incorrect names for me. I dont feel respected. 7 The staff seems to treat every action of every client as a sickness. For example, a woman felt emotional anger when someone was rude towards her in public  the staff fixated on the validity or invalidity of that anger instead of the safety needs in that situation. 8 The staff and the program itself feels very paternalizing. Example  a clinician did an activity asking everyone to name vacation spots that start with F before jumping into talking about emotional dysregulation and severe distress. The clinician an intern in training had a color wheel with activities at the level of a 4th grader for an adult group. 9 The program is apparently owned by a forprofit company and has dangerously negative reviews on google by clients and on LinkedInGlassdoor by staff. ampx200B How do I navigate my care when Im feeling unsupported by the current treatment?",
    "How do I help my depressed sister? My sister comes to me almost every night talking about how she is depressed because she has 0 friends and she cant make any friends no matter how hard she tries. Her other problems consist of being 18 and not even close to having a boyfriend she has never had a boyfriend, being sick of school and wanting to skip getting her associates and getting straight to work, and shes also pretty self conscious of her body and her socially awkwardness in front of others. I am 16 and I truly cannot understand her issues. She talks to me for hours about her problems and when I try to give her advice she gets frustrated. I dont have any friends either, I am also socially awkward, and I also am very self conscious. We share all the same problems the only difference is that she cares way too much and I dont care at all. The advice I try to give her is to show her how and why she shouldnt care. I dont understand how she can care so much about these issues. I understand sometimes but its not a constant battle for me, I eventually continue not caring about my issues and am happy again. Im worried about her because she talks about wanting to kill herself and Im the only person in our family she can talk to because she is afraid of making my parents more depressed than they are. My questions are How do I go about caring for her? Should I just listen to her problems or should I advise her to care less? Perhaps neither of those things?",
    "nothing left the person ive been saying i love you to for the past 1.5 years doesnt even want to be in an actual relationship to me. it all just feels like sweet but empty words. one mom is on disability, and my older brother doesnt have a jobhe just picks up gigs maybe once a month. my other mom just quit her job on the spot two days ago, and has just been sitting around watching TV. im the only one in the house with a stable job. so, i cant quit. my health has never been the best, and im honestly just waiting to see when it finally tanks. part of me hopes its terminal. i cant even afford a therapist that i desperately obviously need. i know i can talk to my friends, but i dont want to burden them when they already have a lot on their plates. no one wants to talk to somebody thats always bringing up negative or heavy topics. i dont want them to leave me too. not even online friends talk to me very much. im just kind of Here. im pretty convinced that the only romantic, lasting relationship ill ever have is with imaginary characters in a dating sim game. now i can barely play anything with a romance plot because ill just make myself sad. i almost went through with it on christmas eve.the only reason i didnt was to keep from ruining christmas for my family.sometimes i wish i did it anyway. tldr i feel trapped and alone in everything, and i feel like its drowning me, and i want to let it. ampx200B edit i tried posting this a day ago, but it didnt even show up on the feed lmao. just my luck!",
    "What is the point? I have been suffering from depression i suppose all my life. However, acknowledgment of it only came 34 years ago. Since acknowledging i have depression, each passing year since I get worst and worst. These last two years have been my lowest with contemplation of harm getting harder to ignore. My 30th birthday was earlier this year and 4 days leading to it the idea of not seeing that birthday was painfully strong. I have no social life. the one friend that i confided in, that relationship has drastically changed. I have no romantic life, and havnt dated in 6 years. and i have no career, recently quitting my job as my mental health plumited, however now i dont think i am good enough for any job so the motivation to look just brings about anxiety and self hate. Note that i have been on lexapro for the last 5 months with my dossage being raised last week, and although it helps regulate my moods a littler better, I am still incredibly sad and hate the pathetic state of my life. I also started therapy the same time i got the perscription and see them one a week. However, although talking out my feelings gives me temporary relief i still dont know the tools needed to be better. I am incredible lonely and dont want to feel this heaviness and self hatred anymore. I guess the reason for my post is to find out if anyone has genuinely overcome their depression to the point that they can say they are truly happy. Or is this something I will have to fight with for the rest of my life, because if it is then what is the point?",
    "I'm a miserable person this is also a rant but I genuinely want help. Im going to therapy. Im on medication. but nothing makes it easier. Im such a miserable person and I feel like a burden on everyone around me. I dont have any friends beyond my boyfriend. and I dont mean that in a  I dont have friends comment if you a real one type of not having friends, I seriously have no one. If you tell me Im not a burden or Im not annoying etc, I wont fight you on it, but I genuinely dont believe you. Im so depressed. my esteem is so low and I cant do anything about it.

    "There's nothing interesting to title this I feel inferior to others, especially my crush whom i asked out and told that i like him. Hes so much more confident than me. Next to him i feel like i want to run and hide. No wonder he rejected me. Everybody is better than me. He is in a club, does karate, hangs out with friends and Im always fucking lazy. I have no funny stories to tell. I do make music but thats very inconsistent and small. I feel small. Constantly listen to videos on self compassion, self love, confidence but i dont do anything with it. Anyways i can be proud of myself that I ASKED him out and I TOLD him how i feel. He would never do that. Good job me",
    "19 years old and its pretty obvious there's no reason to go any further Just graduated High School May 2019 and turned 19 at then end of September but now that Im finally done with school whats next for me? Working as a slave for 50 years? Or putting myself thousands of dollars behind just to go to college setting me back years just to still be a slave anyways? Id rather be dead than do that. I work at a pizza place making 8.75hr and live with my parents. My brother and I want to move out but I cant imagine doing that because thatll require me to find another job to enslave myself in and thats just not how I want my life to go on. Ive seen plenty of threads here on Reddit talking about how they cant keep doing this life of working all day coming home exhausted then sleeping and doing it all over again. Like I said Im 19 and I feel exhausted just working 6 hours a day, Im still a teenager I should be running around young wild and free enjoying life. I sleep about 1214 hours a day and I still take naps and otherwise Im alone in my room playing videos games just to keep my mind off this hellbent reality I was given or typing shit on Reddit because I feel so helpless that I need someone else on the internet to see if they can give me any advise. I have absolutely no social life, never had a girlfriend, still a virgin and unbearably lonely plus the realization that I either must be a slave for the rest of my life or a worthless homeless nobody on the street has caused me to become deathly depressed. I barely even eat because Im too depressed to even crave food, I can tell Im hungry but mentally I have no interest in food unless Im smoking weed. Ive tried meditation and have a strong interest in psychedelics for personal development but all thats done is make me realize just how fake and unreal this 21 century society really is. Id rather live in the wild foraging for food like a monkey over working my ass off for hours a day just for money green paper that people think is so good and meaningful I just dont understand.",
    "How to get brave enough to kill yourself PLEASE NOTE I am not in any danger to myself at this time so no need for urgency. TLDR self hate, worthlessness, getting over fear of death. Im just so tired of living. Ive always hated myself and people since a very early age and I cannot trust anyone. I feel absolutely wrong in this world. Everything I do or say or think is wrong. Since day one I was wrong. I cant do anything right like honestly not trying to exaggerate here and cant make any connections with anyone. Im actually unable to feel love or compassion or any sort of human connection. Dont even get me started on sex Im sick of watching everyone else get what I cant have. I dont deserve love or kindness and Im honestly sick of being the brunt of a very boring joke. I feel like the universe is constantly telling me I dont belong here I also feel like Im not THAT important to have the universe specifically pick on me. My role in this world is to be unremarkable and useless. I only see evil in the world, I can see no kindness. As long as there is man men, there can be on peace. Since the dawn of time weve chosen violence, death and hate. Even in the 21st century we still are starting wars, having genocides and famine and humans are becoming less and less human or more human?? I cant hold onto friendships or make any solid connections. I can only make friend with people who need someones shoulder to cry on and once theyre done with me, theyre gone. I also cling onto anyone that stays remotely too long and then feel utterly betrayed by the smallest problem they face me with. I freak out at the smallest things like dropping a spoon or having a giant mess. I used to be able to pretend to be happy and healthy and human but, as usual, I cant do that right so Im slipping. I cant stay at a job for longer than a year without freaking out. I work at a job Ive wanted for so long but see how little work or care is actually put in by my fellow coworkers and its maddening.",

    "I’m in desperate need of truthful comfort... Ive recently turned 18I have suffered domestic, emotional, mental and formerly physical abuse. As a result I have gotten depression and anxiety, both confirmed by a trained professional. Ive reached out to my friends, to authorities, but they all treat me as if I need to be punished... Im truly trying to reach out and the moment anyones nice to me Im so scared to lose them Now that Ive gotten older some thoughts have come to hit me like a freight train Since I was seven Ive feared of what was to come after death. Bc I knew that most likely itd be like I never existed. As if I was never born I know it sounds incredibly stupid but Ive been researching articles about how far science is from being able to extend our lifespans...but honestly with so many people always either being unable to do much or just choose to punish me, Im not sure how much longer I can last with this heavy thought of what comes after death A huge part of me just wants to kill myself and get it over with... My dog is my only real family, he was with me since I turned five. We grew up together. Once hes gone and my friends have inevitably moved on with their own lives thats when I plan to end it. Im tired of trying when no one can do anything, and I dont want to live decades with these thoughts hanging over my head Medication doesnt help, therapy doesnt help, authorities told me to quote Learn your place...and before any of you say I havent found the right therapist, Ive been to five different ones. Most of whom prescribed different medications The starvation I have for affection made me fall into the tricks of a pedo. I suppose I dont blame authorities for shaming me and treating me like a slut.... I just want it to stop Please... I want it to stop",
    "Tale as old as time: live-at-home, depressed 30 year old with no job. My 20s are gone. Are my best years behind me? Ive been severely anxious and depressed for half of my life. I was diagnosed as bipolar a few years ago since two of the most insane experiences of my life ie hypomanic episodes that led me to do things that have left me traumatized. Ive basically been just existing. Not truly living, but not committed to killing myself. Just an animal that wakes up, eats, and repeats. On the upside, Ive recently committed myself to change. What inspired me to write this was a post I saw on Reddit asking 30 year olds to give advice to people in their 20s. As I start a new and, hopefully, more positive chapter in my life, I realize my 20sthe period that most people hold up to the light and call the most experimental, adventurous, and free time of their livesis gone for me. For me, my 20s was filled with a tremendous amount of fear and sadness. As I enter my 30s, theres more pressure than ever to have accomplished something adult. People are getting married, buying houses, getting promotions, switching careers... I have no idea who I am. My personality has withered away. The weight thats been on my chest is only just lifting, and all that time that others have had to explore and discover themselves is gone from me. Now, its time to put on a tie and plunge myself into the rat race. I feel cheated, behind, and angry. Can anyone relate? How do you think differently? More optimistically? Am I wrong about this?",

At the beginning, all was wonderful, plans of meeting up after this outbreak, then... I happened... Any thoughts?",
    "My girlfriend (22f) no longer can find enjoyment in things that we always loved doing Me and my girlfriend are huge music fans and a big part of our relationship is going to gigs. We used to go to a gig almost every week and it was always really good bonding time. She has depression  anxiety but she was pretty comfortable in gig enviroments as long as she has some personal space. For a couple of months she has seemed more awkward less excited when going to gigs. We went to a show last night of a band she really loves, and she seemed uninterested  unhappy throughout the show. On the way home she admitted to me she doesnt feel any excitement for going to any shows at the moment she doesnt know why and is sad  frustrated as it was one of her favourite things. She says she feels panicky and stressed to just be there. Its hard to understand what couldve triggered this big change and i dont know what i can do to help her. Its hard to know how to make her happy if she doesnt seem to get enjoyment out of anything. She says im the only thing keeping her going which is really hard to hear and feels like a lot of responsibility.

    "My life is amazing, but I'm a miserable asshole. I'm not sure what to do. So Ive hit a wall, and I dont really have any support in my life, so I decided to turn to you guys. Kinda weird for this to be my first post, but whatever. And sorry in advance, this is probably going to be a long rant. Like the title says, I live a really great life. Im married to a beautiful woman who loves me more than anything, the sex is amazing, and shes smart and talented and has a great, lucrative job. I just graduated college 12 years later than I had planned, but doesnt matter in a field that Im really passionate about, with plans to apply for grad school. Financially, I dont live in luxury, but Im comfortable. I have an amazing dog. I have a good, supportive family. I live in a safe neighborhood. Im not trying to brag, but just trying to illustrate how from the outside, I really dont have anything to complain about. Im aware of how incredibly lucky I am. But the problem is, Im just miserable all the time, no matter what I do. For a little background, Ive been in therapy for over two decades Im currently 34. For most of that, I was misdiagnosed with clinical depression, bipolar disorder, several anxiety disorders, and given cocktail after cocktail. Two years ago, it turns out it was a misdiagnosis and it was atypical ADD no hyperactivity, just the concentration and motivation issues, and Ive been properly medicated since. Ive had ECT electroshock twice, before the ADD diagnosis. My current therapist is excellent, and tells me that compared to how I was when I first started seeing her almost 9 years ago Im so far beyond where I was that its astounding. I guess what Im saying is, Ive been lucky in that Ive been able to take advantage of mental health resources, and what Im experiencing isnt due to a lack of those. I have been in quite a few abusive relationships romantic and platonic so I know theres some trauma Im still working through.",
    "We were engaged. He left me for a 19 year old he has been talking to online for the past 3 months I stayed there with him from January to March 2020. He was extremely nice and romantic, I never felt so happy, he really was my soulmate. He was also a very emotional guy, wasnt ashamed of crying and showing his emotions towards me. He asked me to be his girlfriend the day after I got there and he cried when I said yes. I never expected what Ill tell next to happen though. On my last day there, his parents drove with us to drop me off at the airport, and he cried the whole way there. We spent some time by ourselves at the airport, and when the time came for me to go through security to go to the gates, he got down on one knee and asked me to marry him. I never expected that and I was just filled with happiness. Then I said yes but had to walk away, so yeah, even though it was a beautiful moment it was also very sad. I came back to Brazil and we just went back to our online relationship. He eventually came here on December 2020 and stayed until February 2021. We had an awesome time here, I took him to the beach, it was his first time seeing the ocean. Ill never forget his smile when we went in the water. So towards the end of his stay we sat down with my family and told them our plans. His parents would give us, as their wedding gift, one of the best immigration lawyers in the United States, so I could get a K1 Visa and get married there. We started the process, sent them a bunch of documents and were just waiting on the government to give us a feedback. This process is a bit slow now because of the pandemic, so we spent this whole year waiting. Now there comes the bad part of the story, that I never thought would happen. October 2021, the worst month of my life. Actually, I need to go back a little bit, to August 2021. There was this Brazilian girl that did a high school exchange at his city a few years back, 20172018. They only saw each other in person once at the time, had each other added on Snapchat ever since, but never talked.",

    "Need help with self-sabotaging behaviors. So I have been tapering off my medications now. I have been on medications for over 5 years, and it has not helped in managing my anxiety or depression. I feel more energetic now. The issue is, there is a demon lurking in my mind which comes out from time to time and creates havoc. For example I had saved a huge chunk of money from my first salary I received last month. Spent money carefully, was responsible enough, etc. A couple of days back, I grew so emotional and reacted so badly to some things that cried till my eyes, body and joints hurt. My body fell numb and I couldnt move out of the bed. I ended up spending 75 of my savings on things that neither helped me elevate my mood or had any practical use. This is not the first time either. Everytime I tend to do something right, I would do something extremely irrational immediately and try to spoil the one good thing that I have. I constantly think of running away from my house and live a quiet life in the suburbs, where no one knows who I am and where I come from. I have lost trust in myself to an extent that I depend on validation from others for my every little feeling. I dont trust what I think or feel at all. I am lost and can see only death as a solution from this unending misery. Has anyone been through this before and got out of it successfully? If not, what are you currently trying rhaf may may not be working? Please provide some solutions that I can actually apply to my life and not the philosophical or religious ones, I have had enough of those.",
    "I lost my job and potentially my career due to a deep depression. Hello, I 27F am using my alternative account because there are people who are trying to hurt me with anything they can find out about me. I was diagnosed with Anxiety, depression, and Bipolar disorder at the age of 11 and have always struggled, but I functioned for the most part. A little over a year ago, I was in the darkest place of my life. My dad had just had a major heart attackstrokeaneurism and was destined to die according to doctors he beat the odds with months of comastherapy. My favorite aunt had committed suicide and left my two high school aged cousins motherless. Most terribly though, my ex had blindsided me and illegally started a child custody battle to take my only child, a 7 year old, away from me who I have raised his whole life. I spent all my personal investmentssavings, 15,000, to hire a top attorney and was left broke and completely shattered. My partner was there to support me as much as he could so my son an i had a roof over our head but i was suffering. Shortly before this all happened, I had completed my 1 year internship at a major Financial Firm amp had gained my Series 7 amp Series 66 FINRA licenses. I was so proud of my accomplishments, salary, and stability after 10 years of customer service and sales jobs that did not provide full stability. I was so happy, the happiest I had been in a long time, and then everything came crashing down at the same time. I had an amazingly supportive boss who helped me every step of the way until I exhausted my PTO, UTO, FMLA, Short Term Personal Leave and he had run out of options to offer me. During all this time, I was nothing but a husk. I wouldnt leave my bed, eat, shower, and I spent hours just sleeping. My partner didnt know what to do and Psychiatrist were unavailable due to a large shortage in my city over 6 month waits and up to 9 months. I refused to go to an inpatient facility because I knew it would hurt my child custody case but at the time, that probably would have been the best option. This went on for over 3 months.",

    "Hi, Im fighting my way out of my depression but it is hard. Need tips on how to motivate myself again. Hi everyone, Im a uni graduate, 7 months out now but no job to show for it, a lot has gone down since this time, and id like to go through it if you can be patient with me. Before I left university everything was going well, i had just come back from an internship i had in China, I had a loving girlfriend, I graduated very well from a top universuty. And i was prepared to move forward with my life. But i think it has all gone wrong. First, I had a depressive spiral in my teens that i recovered from before, i had an L4 spinal fusion and spent 6 months recovering in bed Though snuck out to debate in parliament, take that doctors!!. Left alone with my thoughts, and my friends moving away to university. I sunk into a depression that nearly culminated in me killing myself. Though i fought my way out and tried to better myself. My girlfriend left me for another bloke, i got really ill and lost a lot of muscle i grew after my surgery and became skinny fat. And my Best friendship broke down after he threatened and tried to cut me with a knife A whole Mentally ill saga that would take pages and pages to explain.. And moved back to a struggling home with physicallymentally ill parents that dont know how to support me emotionally Not their fault!! they do try their best by me. All of which contributed to me sinking into a depression in October, i fought my way out and applied for a range of different jobs and schemes. But didnt get on any of them. This caused another spiral that lasted till February. Ive been fighting my way out though, i was seeing a therapist but covid killed that, and was taking antidepressants but they made things worse.

    "I’m tired of pushing forward. Hello all. This is my first time trying to reach out for help and doing so with friends and family feels shameful because I am my familys rock and support system. Its never been the other way around and the few times I asked for some help from my wife its always ended badly. I am 27 Male with a wife who is 28 and a son who is 3. When I met my wife I was already depressed, though never clinically diagnosed. All the signs were there though. Always tired, no motivation, indulging in vices just to feel something. I had no purpose and in all honesty I never ended it because it would be more trouble than it was worth. My mother and sister would be hurt and financially strained from my sudden death so I just lived day in and day out trying to not to sink too low. They were my excuse to live. After meeting my wife things because brighter. My family definitely noticed an improvement in my attitude and I started taking care of my self more. For a while we only hung out, nothing official yet so I wanted to put my best self forward in hopes of building a relationship with this amazing woman. A year later we married and she got pregnant. It was my sons birth that pushed me to go back to school and get a better job. Simply put my finances would not be able to sustain a decent life style. Ive noticed though that slowly over the years Ive started to fall back into the same depressed state of mind. I am unbelievably tired all the time, I have started buying more alcohol than normal and spending more and more time playing online games in hopes of getting some moments or happiness in a day of glum. My wife has noticed and started complaining that Im changing for the worse. I can see it but I just cant seem to do anything about it. I have moments of motivation where I will be good for a couple days but then revert back. Recently I had a bad episode where I just started drinking and wallowing in self pity. My son was already asleep so he wasnt exposed to it. When my wife came home she seemed concerned but didnt really know how to react.",
    "I can't keep going I have almost no friends, Im failing in all my school subjects, and Ive fallen so deep in love with someone I cant have that I dont think my life is worth living. Ive thought of killing myself many times before, but Ive never gone through with it because of the impact it would have on my family and the people I care for. My best friend is a girl who Ive fallen in love with so hard that I would literally give anything just to see her happy. But she doesnt feel the same way towards me and I dont want to leave her as Im the person she turns to whenever she has a depressive episode. If I ended my life she would be left with nobody and Im scared for what would happen to her, but I know she wont ever need me the way I need her and that thought itself is one of the reasons why I feel so down. I dont think Im ever going to love anyone to the extent I love her so whats the point of living if Im never going to be able to feel emotion to that same level. Im sorry if this im just another stupid kid rambling about their problems but I just want to go to sleep and never wake up to face another day of loneliness",

    "Are antidepressants the nuclear option? Hi, I was in a serious car accident recently and walked away but Im left with some long term health issues that will take months to resolve because of waiting lists UK based. The health issues mean I cant take part in my main hobby as Ive been told that partaking in that hobby will lead to a worsening of the medical issue and lead to permanent damage. Over the last few weeks, Ive been struggling. Im low and on the verge of tears all day every day. I cant concentrate, I have brain fog, I forget what Im doing constantly, I have real trouble making any type of decision. I have a stressful job which requires me to be at my best, and Im not managing it very well. I take no enjoyment in anything I do, Im avoiding family and friends. The more time that passes, the worse I feel. Im guilty that I dont feel relieved that the outcome wasnt worse, Im angry that someone elses other drivers poor decision making has put me here. My friends and family my partner in particular are worried about me as I am not myself, I feel guilty about this too but cant bring myself to feel normal so I avoiding speaking to them. Im on a waiting list for counselling, and Ive been having regular catch ups with my doctor, but this week I spoke with someone new and within 5 minutes of speaking to me for the first time, she told me my symptoms suggested depression and prescribed antidepressants with a suggested minimum course of 1 year. I have a family history of depression, but this is the first time that I have been here, and medication feels like a huge step, especially seeing as she mentioned taking them for a year. I just want to get back to feeling like myself again, but what I have heard about antidepressants suggests that they wont be the magic fix. Am I right to be cautious of this new doctors advice or should I respect their medical experience and just go with it?",

I cant do anything but watch YouTube videos. I cant keep dates straight. I constantly forget about doctors appointments. Ive tried everything short of getting a personal assistant. I dont understand many social situations. Dating and making good friends is increasingly more difficult. Ill trust literally anyone.

    "What would be the best way to talk to my S.O. about getting help tomorrow when it's a really upsetting subject for her even though she needs it? She tells her parents who are doing a very shit job at looking after their daughter btw that shes just not feeling well or she pretends to eat and gets away with it. She also has terrible mood swings, one minute shes happy, joyful, playful, laughing, the next shes depressed, crying, suffocating herself in her blanket, cutting herself..... this is all over facetime because her parents are not allowing me to see her as they are very strict so her mood just changes out of nowhere and whenever I try to bring up her needing help or asking if somethings wrong she gets really upset. Shes terrible at taking care of herself and has proclaimed many times I hate myself, thats why but never goes into detail. She names many things about herself that she hates but I dont think those are why she does everything she does, and if it is thats why I suggest for her to get help but she refuses all the time. She never eats, never drinks water, barely sleeps, does everything she can when shes sick to make herself worse such as drinking coffee and staying up, she never takes her medication, she purposely hurts herself, she doesnt open up, she doesnt respect her own values and boundaries, hell she threw away her inhaler because of whatever reason but she needs it so she doesnt die from a coughing fit due to her thyroidism, which she doesnt do anything to help either. She never allows herself to warm up when shes cold, she suffocates herself in a blanket, she doesnt take her meds for it, its sad more than it is upsetting if Im being honest. Lately she has been getting rid ofblocking out people who are helping her, which is why Im glad I convinced her to let me talk to her about this tomorrow, but anyways she convinced her stupid ass useless parents that she doesnt need a therapist anymore, she doesnt tell her doctor anything, she doesnt open up to her parents understandable because they get mad or brush it off.",

I just want someone to talk to and help me. Im getting angry and sometimes want to hurt people I dont want to hurt. I have a lack to motivation to do work. I dont feel the need to eat. No one is helping me with this, no one is talking to me about this. If I did ever tell my friends I would think they would say I was being weak and whiny. My family would just say boys shouldnt cry and I need to be stronger to be a real man. I am now starting to get thoughts in my head about killing myself and I really dont want to. I want to hurt myself but dont want to. I am really scared. I have had these thoughts since the age of 6 and now 7 years later I now want to talk to someone comforting.",
    "TW; First Fatherless Father's Day I23m lost my dad to covid19 at the start of this year. I woke up and realized what day it is and just started sobbing. My partner25f lost her dad at a young age and has numbed herself to cope as his passing played a huge part in the path her life took, but this is still fresh for me. Its the first Fathers Day without him. I asked for some support from her and her responses were very cold. You cant let today hurt you like this. I just ignore this day, you gotta just stay off your phone. You cant cry all day about this. I get that shes had time to cope with this trauma, and her responses are partly to protect herself from her feelings about her own dad shes been dealing with for years, but fuck. I needed support, just some time to let it out and confront my feelings, and after the way she responded Im no longer sure how I feel about this woman. What would you do? I try really hard to be understanding of others feelings, and especially compassionate of my partners feelings. But I honestly dont know if I can be with someone who would invalidate my feelings like that, even with their own trauma. She came to apologize and acknowledge that she was being inconsiderate, but that hurt me so much I dont even want to look at her right now. I dont know. I love this woman, and Im incredibly patient with partners. Her responses show a fundamental lack of compassion that I cant teach, but her apology shows an understanding of her fuck up and an attempt to right it, so I dont know what to do about it. Maybe after I take some time to cool off we can talk about it and gain better understanding. For anyone else hurting today, Im so sorry, just remember our fathers are out there somewhere, having a big cookout in the sky, fighting over Grill Master and looking down pridefully at the amazing children they made.",
    "The Story of This Year I cried everyday, I never left my room, I avoided everything and everyone. There was parties in my house and I just laid in my room and cried while the world went by. It may sound ridiculous but I havent had a great life and the smallest things get to me. After the month, I kinda got over the overdose and went about my days. Life started getting a bit better again, there were more smiles and laughter. One of my house mates during the time we lived together was terrible with money. He gets paid at 1230am every Sunday and goes out every Saturday night so usually he spends all his pay as soon as it comes in on drinks. Because of this, my room mates and I had to cover his rent and food throughout the week. This lasted for a few months. Things started getting worse with the guy, he gets very angry and started masking his problems with drugs specifically weed. He would go out everyday and get really high so he didnt have to deal with his problems, my room mates and I were getting very broke trying to support him and it got to the point we couldnt anymore. He never paid us back after countless promises and he never did anything around the house. One night we got into a massive fight and I kicked him out, we stayed friends and we spoke all the time and we learnt it was better this way. We became closer not living together because we didnt have the tension and added stress. Im sorry this story jumps a lot, theres so much content that I cant really focus I didnt realise till after I kicked him out how much I spent time with him. My other two room mates were sleeping together since the start and they would spend 60 of their time in bed. Because of this, the room mate I kicked out and I got really close because we only had each other. After kicking him out I was very lonely. I dont deal well with being alone and I constantly need company so I feel okay. The male room mate out of the 2 that were sleeping together ended up finding another girl he liked and he spent a lot of time with her which left me and the girl to get very close.",

    "Depressed firefighter ends things My 30 f ex boyfriend 34 ended things from depression at the beginning of the shut down from covid. He told me he didnt love me anymore almost 3 weeks ago. I dont know if this is how he really feels or if its the depression closing him off to feeling anything. I havent spoken to him since he told me. But I go back and read older messages leading up to the break up and I see him telling me hes struggling with the depression but he tells me how happy I make him and how much he loves me and I keep him afloat. But once he hit a really bad rough patch he closed me out completely. Has anyone experienced this before from my position or even from his that could give me some insight of how their stories progressed with their loved ones as the depression lastedor while you or they got help? I believe in my heart he does love me and the depression suppressed those feelings. You dont just have those feelings disappear from a happy relationship without some type of issue going on. Ive been dying to reach out to him but I was the one that said I needed to heal, but with the riots going on and him being a firefighter and his mother telling me he said the therapist is getting him to open up I want to reach out so bad. Can yall share your stories and give me any insight on his possible feelings or what people did in my own personal shoes? He is the love of my life and losing him has been the hardest thing Ive ever experienced. He also has never dealt with depression before so its entirely new for him. Thank you for anyone and everyone that can help or atleast share their own experiences.",

Im suffering severe depression at the moment which has worsened after a breakup bit of background, Ive suffered from depression on and off for the last 10 years. Unmediated right now  thinking of going back back but afraid of going back to my old cycles. Ive been in some very dark places recently and have regular ideation. Im okay right now  Im lucid and not distressed or apathetic to the point of wanting to end things. As mentioned, I recently started a new job. A promotion in my current company.

    "Angry Issues Causes Everyone to Leave, Should I Be Alone? I have always had anger issues and an attitude that no one has ever liked. A lot of my family, friends, have experienced this side of me and either refuse to talk to me altogether, ignore me, or block me and remove me from their lives never speaking to me ever again, even if knowing them for years on end. So lately Ive gone off on family and friends and it made me feel bad afterwards. But now I feel like I want to just be alone. Not talking to anyone at all, because if I dont then I cant get angry or show my ugly attitude etc. Part of me just feels terrible and I just dislike who I am as a person. I want to be a better person and for everyone to love and care for me, but all I am doing is pushing everyone away. What would you do?",
    "Ghosted by Son and His Mom Ive been dealing really well with depression for awhile. Mostly just some hard spikes up in depression where its a few hours of intense depression and anxiety. But this has got me in the numb, why bother zone, which I feel is the most dangerous because it can last for so long. My son late teens and I had a pretty good relationship as far as I could tell, and for being half a country apart. We chatted online almost every day, and sometimes game online. Its his preferred way of communicating. We had a great time together this summer. He stopped responding about 3 weeks ago. I texted him and he politely said the equivalent of, I need some space for about a week, just working something out. I respect that and I let him know that. I asked his mom if it was something I should worry about or if theres anything I can do to help. She responded that its teenager stuff and hes not in danger. Son lives with depression and anxiety too. So I give space. 2 weeks go by. I message him just to check in and let him know I love him. Nothing. Then a message about his upcoming psychologist appointment. I say that its scary to me that he needs to see a psychologist, but I dont know anything about whats going on. No response. I email his mom, we mostly talk Christmas gifts but no answers about how our son is doing. Its been over 3 weeks now. I emailed his mom again a couple days ago. No response. Im worried for him. She has left me uninformed about very important things about our son before. This is extremely unusual for him, especially for this time of year. Were usually chatting about Christmas stuff. I feel like throwing up. Im very worried for him. Maybe he is ok. Maybe this is just what happens. I understood the day could come when he goes off on his own and Im an occasional thought and memory. Thats what I could get for living so far away since he was a toddler. Whole other story why that happened that Im not going to get into.",
    "I’m not sure if I have depression, please reply, I made posts to other subreddits and no one answered and it’s making me feel even worse Then in high school I finally made friends. During 10th grade my friend told me that my crush of 6 years called me super ugly and said who would want to date her? That shattered everything. And now I believe that Im so repulsive that I will never find love and I will be lonely forever. Fortunately, I made friends, and one cool thing I do with a group Im really close with is that we have therapy sessions and we talk about our problems and try to cheer each other up. Ive yet to have my session yet, but I accidentally gave away that I hate my body and they think I have body dysmorphia, I think I have it too but I cant say cause I havent been diagnosed. Honestly it made me feel so good that there were people who were concerned about me but that never happened again. They never speak about it like they speak about other friends problems... Thats probably because I havent told them all this, and I wouldve but Im afraid. What if all of this is me being too dramatic. And that what Im feeling isnt serious and they think bad of me. And Im scared to go to a therapist because of that same reason. So I rather keep all these emotions inside, and almost every night I cry because of these problems. Most of the times at night, I feel empty, lifeless. If I close my eyes I imagine Im floating through space lifeless. My thoughts are very dangerous because I keep thinking more negative, and to avoid that I go on my phone and distract myself by doing something. Because of my disease I have to take pills daily, and Ive always thought that I have an easy chance to kill myself by taking a lot of them, but I dont think I would because its a sin in my religion, but maybe one day Im too down that I might do something... Can someone please tell me if this is depression or not, because I really want to overcome it. Please reply to this, Ive made many posts on other subreddits regarding this and no one has answered, which makes me feel like no one truly cares. Thank you.",
    "Wife wants space to fight depression I have made the conscious decision to fight with every strand of my being to save this marriage and I will not be the one that ends it. Things have been fairly positive, we have met up at least once a week for walkscoming over for dinner etc etc. But its all very friendly, but I do say that I love her every now and then. She wants to take things one step at a time and she is open to marriage counselling, if the mental health counselling doesnt work out. I think deep down she still loves me even though she doesnt say it or that she misses me but does slip in the odd soppy nickname here and there. Might be just a habit, I dont know. She still clearly cares about me because the other day she barged into the house after my phone wasnt receiving sending calls or texts and I didnt let her know I was safe at home. She also does other things like picks things off me like the odd scab and blackhead here and there, cut my hair and hugs me in a meaningful manner. I feel like I may be rambling a bit here, I want to feel positive about things but I am really struggling. I am putting a brave face on for her so she has less pressure, but anytime we part ways I sob uncontrollably for hours because i just love her so much and want her to come home. Has anyone else gone through something similar with their spouse? Any tips? Ive been extremely self critical and I can see there are improvements I can make to make the relationship better. Especially now we have more financial freedom. But with lockdown still in force, it makes things 10x more difficult. TLDR My wife wants space to find out what she wants. She says Ive done nothing wrong. We still talk and meet up. Marriage counselling after her individual counselling. Im hurting and want neutral advice.",
    "\"I hate myself\" ... Change from CBT to psychoanalytic? Hi, maybe someone got some insight into this. I have been in cognitive behavioral therapy for years. While it helped me coping with rumination and anxiety, I still dont like myself very much. I am often under the impression I should be someone else, someone better... be more manly, be more independent, be more active... well, it goes on for a while  Now, recently a friend got me to think about my childhood, and one thing stood out. In 3rd or 4th grade I wrote the sentence I hate myself over and over again in some of my school notebooks. None of the teachers seemed to notice it  at least I dont remember ever being asked about it. Also I seem to have a lot less memories about my childhood than other people. My mum told me three years ago, after I just came out of a twomonth stationary therapy and mentioned to her that I have some gaps in my memory, that I had a happy childhood. I have no reason to doubt her honesty, but I know she is able to see things the way she wants them to. Also, I want to cry all the time, but I cant. It often is on the edge, but mostly it stays there, or just a few seconds of real crying and then I get too selfconscious, I guess, and it stops. Its killing me... like something wanting to get out... Im 31 and just want to cry a whole day like a baby, but I cant. Is it maybe time to go an oldschool psychoanalytic approach? I just have vague notions of couches and old bearded men and hypnosis My therapist is great, but there is no real breakthrough. It always feels like there must be more. I even consider trying psychedelics now to help me get to the root. Well, that was a lot. Any help, insight, comment is appreciated. No native speaker, so please ask if anything is unclear.",
    "I don’t know why I’m seeking help here but please just read as much as you can... Theres heaps more I can talk about like my addiction to games even when Im not enjoying them and the recent passing of artist xxxtentacion I know hes a very controversial person but I really enjoyed his music and just seeing his face and hearing his messages to his fans. Im failing at school since year 8 and Im always feeling worried about how I went in a test or having 1000 bricks on my chest scared what my mum will say when she sees how I went. I spent the entire 2nd half improving and trying my best especially in English where my teacher would repeatedly remind me Im an intelligent kid but Im just lazy, and when I thought I had improved I went from the first semester being all Cs and turned it into Cs and one D. I cant focus on anything important in class, I cant remember stuff and it feels like everything Ive explained in this post is coming together and ruining my life, making me feel hopeless and giving me a feeling of life being pointless. My ideal life right now would be one where I can stay home all day without worrying about any responsibilities or having to deal with my peers or school. Being around people seems to make me feel more lonely. Being around family im almost always happy. Avoiding all of these things feels like it would make me feel great again even though me in my right mind wouldve hated the idea of being alone at home all day with my boring parents. I dont know what to do. I want to see a doctor deep down but i also dont want to know if theres something wrong, I dont want to do the whole medication and therapy thing. I just want to be a normal kid who can be happy and out there like I used to be. Im sorry for talking so much but I just wanted to let it all out and ask if people think these are signs that I should seek help. Maybe if theres anybody going through something similar to me who has been diagnosed. Any sign to help me know whats wrong with me because I want to seek help but I dont want to tell my parents about it and have them tell me Im just going through the teenage stage of life, and then have a doctor tell me the same and make me look and feel even worse.",
    "Advice to an 18 y/o depressed closeted bisexual dude who mostly has anti-lgbt religious family &amp; friends and is contemplating suicide? this post got no replies in the depression subreddit so here I go Im an 18 yo dude. Im starting my first year of college this August. Ive been thinking about coming out as bi to a few friends that I care about and ones I hold dear, but Im afraid of what might happen if I do it. Were all Christians my familys Catholic. I know a lot of people I care about wont approve of me whenif I come out. I project myself as this straight guy whos just an allysupporter for LGBTQ rights. Ive fought with some religious friends as I defended the topic of samesex civil unions online amp offline. Its been about 10 months since I last went to a Sunday church service where I used to talk to some friends who go to church there. I still go to my neighborhood Catholic church because of my dad who put me in the choir along with my brother. My dads also the president of our Catholic church choir. Hes also VERY outspoken about being antiLGBTQ. I find it hard to come out to my family because were super religious Catholics. There was a time when my Born Again Christian cousin female came out, they recommended her to go to conversion therapy. I was one of the few family members who know this along with my older other cousin and some of my unclesaunts. I wont be coming out to my family. Maybe not yet. Or maybe not ever, considering the factors Ive just mentioned. My dad and I would probably fight if my family finds out. Its ironic that its hard to be open to your own family whom you share the same house with. Still havent catch up with a friendchurch leader from churchschool. I feel bad for ghostingavoiding friends from this church I used to go to Born Again Christian. The last time I went to that church was July 2018.

I have a 16 year old brother that I live with, with my mom and other sibling father comes by often to visit. My bro has always been the type of teen to spend hours alone in his room, usually in bed, in the dark lights almost always off. He is usually on his phone and listening to music. Pretty typical teen stuff though the fact he sometimes spends hours in his room in the dark, not particularly doing anything, has always worried me. Since quarantining, so for about a month, he has become increasingly lethargic and unmotivated. He doesnt want to go outside for walks or drives. He is doing some of his school work, but missing meetings and other assignments. His sleep schedule is all over the place, I honestly dont know how much he sleeps and how much he just spends laying in bed. My parents are not the best at handling the situation. It usually results in yelling, sometimes violence, and my brother usually reverts more into his seclusion and silence. Im basically just looking for any advice. How can I help him? Thanks in advance.",
    "What can I do to have a normal life? My neglectful narcissistic dad has ruined my life. Right now my confidence is lower than ever. Im too self conscious to even go out to the kitchen. Im extremely embarrassed of my body if my blanket is not covering it. I havent talked to anyone besides my parents in over a year except for the time when I had to go to my high school for exams 6 months ago. I dropped out shortly after. I suppress my emotions as much as I can, even when no one is around. When were visiting relatives I pretend to be the perfect little girl, who smiles all the time and loves to study, has big plans for the future, etc. Im worried that if things dont change, Ill just end it all Im not suicidal, so maybe in 56 years?. As of now, Im not a functional human being and I have no use for anyone. I spend the whole day scrolling through reddit, watching videos on youtube and playing minecraft. I want to get a job to get out of here asap, but I cant even look into someone elses eyes without getting a panic attack. I cant keep a conversation going even through texting. Therapy is not an option. The last 3 therapists have ruined my confidence and self esteem even more. I want friends, I want someone to talk to me, I want someone to care about me and I want someone to care about, I want a boyfriend, I want to worry about things people my age worry about, I want to finally live the life I want to. Im sick of this constant despair, I want to stop hating on everyone who has it better. I want to be normal. How do I get started? What do I do? Do I even have a chance for life?",
    "How do I gain confidence when almost every person I've talked to has put me down for my appearance? Sure Im doing all this self care for myself, but I need to feel accepted by someone. Ive never had a girlfriend, never had a best friend, never had someone I spiritually resonate with. Ive never had anyone. I was physically abused by my father and Ive been completely alone ever since. My entire existence has only been suffering and I dont understand why Id be put here just to feel pain and suffering all while completely alone. I just bottle up all my emotions and pretend it doesnt bother me but of course its eating away at my sanity. I dont have to be gorgeous or the prettiest man but Im just tired of hearing how ugly I am. It breaks my heart so much I can literally feel pressure on my heart just thinking about how wrong Ive been done over the course of my entire life. I guess the main reason I typed this all out is really to ask, how do I keep going even though Im completely alone? How do I keep living knowing that Im all Ive ever had and nobody is there for me? How do I find the motivation to keep being a kind person when all Ive been shown is repulsion for just trying to be myself. How can I find a friend or girlfriend that cares about my opinions and point of view on life without making me feel ugly and worthless. How do I find any reason not to end my life with the gun thats in the room right next to me?",
    "I'm losing hope I just need help... Im losing grip on my life... If anyone even reads this... I want you to take one thing away from my pain...

If this is goodbye....thank you",
    "Am I depressed? This past week I F16 have been feeling really down. Its been on and off for the past 7 months after I broke up with my girlfriend, but the lows only lasted two, three days tops. Im not trying to self diagnose but Im worried I might be developing something. Im not proud of it but Ive been drinking as well, everyday for a little over a week. I have support, my friends know all of this and offer to help and talk to me but it just makes me uncomfortable and like Im a nuisance. We make packs to stop drinking but I always end up breaking them. Ive been missing school too, I cant find myself to get up and socialize with people. Is there a way to find out, rather than just talking to a therapist? I dont want to get worked up about nothing but I seriously feel awful. Thanks in advance.",

    "How to motivate myself to start a virtuous cycle? I know that if I exercise, I feel a sense of achievement, I get endorphins from exercising and generally feel a lot more positive about things. I have got a training plan arranged with either running or exercises to do six days a week I thought the accountability would help and I havent done anything for over a week. I feel very little motivation to do anything which isnt helped by the fact its so cold and miserable outside and gets dark quickly.

I see other people do it with ease, but its always just... how did you know to say that thing you said? So I just dont know how to connect positively, I guess. As a result, Im constantly miserable, and negative, and just... an asshole. And I hate it. And I want to be better, but Ive hit this wall where it seems like I cant be better until I can connect with something good, and I just... cant figure out how to do that, even though I know how to do it, and I follow the steps and... nothing. I have that stupid voice telling me to delete this, that its a bunch of rambling nonsense and no one on here is going to care. That probably means I should post this.

    "I am falling off track of everything I am 28 , graduated 5 months back and havent found a job yet . I have been rejected after multiple final rounds . Now its come to the point where I dont believe things will work out . Not comparing but cant stop thoughts of being scared for myself , when I hear everyone in my batch has a job . I used to be a person who would wake up before sunrise , eat healthy , read books and learn new things . I was someone who would never skip a workout , eat only clean foods , meditate every day and take care of my skin. Now, I dont get out of my bed and dont even look forward to the next day , cos its the same thing on loop , pushing myself to apply for jobs with no belief in whatever I am doing . I miss my workouts and feel lazy to cook for myself , I will order food from a restaurant often which does not feel good after eating at all . I can not do anything other that eating and sleeping . I miss the old me , I used to be a very strong woman . People used to compliment me for my mental strength. I have been through a lot in the past and have overcome it but this time I am unable to get myself back . I dont know this me . Above all this , I live with a roommate who for some reason enjoys when I get rejected from an interview. I have seen that on his face . Even when he knows that I didnt get the job he would on purpose ask me again how did my interview go . Other than that he cares about nothing , and has a very weird vibe . He talks about me to his friends, I dont even know these people and when they come home , they literally know each and everything about me . And to add to this, I feel the need for someone to tell me that I am good enough but I dont get it . I seek that from my father but he is just worried that if I will find a job or not . He doesnt say that out loud but I can read that from our conversations , so I dont feel like speaking at home . I dont know whats so wrong with me that I can just lose myself like this . I want me back .",

    "My Government won't support my parents any longer for having me Disclaimers Never posted on reddit before, but I dont know who else to talk to. The grammar will be off because I am quite upset as I type this, my apologies. Quick backstory Ive suffered from depression ever since I was around 16, now Im soontobe 25. I tried seeing a therapist back when I was 18 and started university. She was truly awful and I thought I had no right to see a therapist. Fast forward to january 2019, I decided to try another therapist because I am truly incapable of living in this state. I still havent finished university. Im trying but failing. Im incapable of doing most tasks, let alone focus on studying. Although I have a job I dont get paid much. I depend on my parents who try to support me, but soon wont have the governments support because Im too old to count as a child. I just found out and I feel aweful. I never wanted to be a burden to my parents. Theyre not made of money, and although my mom said she wont kick me out, I know shes growing impatient. Shes having a difficult time understanding me anyways and this will only make it so much harder. I struggle very hard not to let the thought of ending it all so theyll be better of take over. Because I know my mom wont be better of knowing Ive commited suicide. I dont want to die. I just cant live. Does anyone on this reddit know how to deal with this? I should talk to my therapist about this, I know. But my next session wont be for another 2 weeks.",
    "Had my 1st doctor appointment to address my anxiety/depression, it was......weird. Need some feedback, please. So I had my first Drs appointment to address my increasing anxiety and depression yesterday, and found some things a bit...odd. Id like some feedback on a few things just need to know whether some of the stuff Im about to post is common, or not ampx200B 1. A lot of the stuff was up to me and I was given questions I had no idea how to prepare for or answer. I went into this with a I have no idea what the hell is going on in my head, but its bad, and I need to address it mentality. I have no idea why Im depressed or anxious so much, only that I did NOT used to be like this. Do you think your Anxiety is caused by your Depression, or your Depression is caused by your Anxiety? The answer? I honestly have no idea, Im coming in with my own mind being a total mystery to me. I didnt know it had to be either one of these. I was asked what kind of medication I think I should be on given a choice between Wellbutrin or another unnamed medication that attacks both Anxiety and Depression together  I had no idea how to answer this either, I dont know. When I made this decision I was only 30 minutes into discussing this with a medical professional for the first time in my life, I have absolutely no clue. ampx200B 2. After this short 45minute single appointment with a Psychiatrist, I walked out with prescriptions for Wellbutrin XL and Vistaril. I havent taken either yet, because Im not sure thats right for me. I just feel like 45minutes wasnt even close to enough time for me to explain me and give enough information that a Doctor could make a decision on the right medication for me. And I know that antidepressants and medications of this sort are a total crapshoot, but even given that, I dont feel confident that Id even be taking a good crapshoot from a single 45minute appointment with a brand new doctor. Is that notion true? Are antidepressants and medications like this still a total crapshoot?",
    "Skipped school to kill myself, didn't go through with it, what now? Please help me, anyone. I literally did nothing for the next 30 minutes to an hour, literally felt nothing, just thinking about what I was going to do. Then after that I just went to my bed, and started researching for maybe 34 hours, methods, what to expect, etc. etc., all these things that I had been too scared to look up before. Found out the way I wanted to go, was literally about to go find the things I needed, but was so scared that I wanted to delay it somehow, even though I was still determined to go through with it. I told myself that I would set a timer for 30 minutes to sleep, and after that if I still wanted to kill myself, Id do it after that. Well when I woke up, I felt a little different, a little more hopeful, Im honestly not sure why, just hopeful enough to not kill myself today at least. Now I have to figure out what to do next. I had a math test today, an ap macro final, a small spanish presentation, and an anatomy quiz. It just seems so so so overwhelming, like I cant deal with it and I dont even know where to start, or what to say to the teachers, or if I can still take them, or what I tell my dad when the school calls today to tell him I wasnt there, or what to do about trying to manage this so I dont end up going through with my plan tomorrow, or the day after that, or next week.

    "Why can't depression ever be gone forever? Hi, sorry i still dunno how reddit work yet. I just joined and its my first time talking about such stuff online. Ive been diagnosed with depression and few other stuff few years ago and i had treatement and such until i felt better but whenever i got into an argument with family i could feel it crawl back in me. Up until now Ive been strong enough to overcome those small situations. And even tho i feel better most of the time i can feel it whenever im sort of reverting back to it. Like i start to go out less and less, i stop talking to people online and irl and answering the phone becomes a hard task.. then i start to distract myself by bingewatching shows so i dont leave space to thinking, i dontcant sleep at night and i have a hard time remembering things i just did or dont realize Ive done them. And i like reading but it becomes hard like i cant focus and i end up skipping lines or read without rememberingunderstanding what i just read. The more i stay home the harder it is to get out. Anyway thats how i know shit is getting serious. Other than that i sometimes have a hard time swallowing food the doctor said it was anxiety a lack of magnesium and having supplements did help but anyway. Two days ago came back home i was in a good mood i brought sweets for everyone at home except i fould out novody was there. I have a kitten at home i brought it recently about two months ago. its 5 months old and it still pees in the wrong spots when its far from its litter. The past few weeks it peed 3 times on my blanket and i had to take it get cleaned everytime. I barely got to use it so this time i had put it in a closed room so the cat cant get to it. But a cousin of mine opened the room to feed the cat there and my father had taken away the litter out of the room because thats what he does .. whatever he likes basically. Anyway when i came back i found the door open and pee on the blanket that i had just taken out of from cleaning a night before and put aside away from the cat but there it was dirty again.

    "I'm so tired Thats when the topic of school opening came up, there was a virtual and hybrid option, I wanted to stay home and they were dead set on getting me back in. That led to a lot of usually hour long arguments with my mom where we went in complete circles, I was just scared and worried for my familys health, but eventually I was sent in to school. Around this time my Grandma passed away, it came out of nowhere and added to the confusion of it all. Ive always been accepting of death and everything, but it still hurt a lot to go through. I missed her, and I just had no idea what was going on anymore. I also struggled with intrusive thoughts a lot, something that continues even now. They went from anything as random as questioning my gender to recurring thoughts of suicide, I had absolutely no control of them but them just being there constantly drained a lot out of me. School was rough, none of my friends were in person, meeting new people was really hard with no after school stuff, and teachers clearly werent having an easy time adjusting to teaching this way. Motivation was hard again, I tried drawing and going outside as much as possible just so I could do something at least, but I didnt feel better. Being at school was just a constant reminder of what position we were all in, I just missed having a normal uneventful year of school at this point. Eventually cases started rising again and I wanted to switch to virtual school again, so yet again I fought with my parents about it every other day. School was miserable, no one was there anymore, no one I knew and none of the familiar faces I didnt, I just wanted to be with my friends at home at least then I could talk to them in class. My memories are fuzzy here but I remember a really bad spiral. I ran out of therapy appointments, it didnt really help anyways and my therapist never really gave me any methods to feel better instead of just trying to do things more.",

Im a generally very happy person amp Im not sure how to deal with this. I dont think hes professionally diagnosed because I do remember him saying it feels like hes depressed but never said he was diagnosed. I dont want to doubt him but at the same time I dont think what hes feeling is something as severe as depression. I dont know what to do. Should I just support him either way? If so, how am I supposed to support someone when theyre having depressing episodes?",
    "Is it right to help someone commit suicide? I understand. And helping them doesnt do anything. People will say I am guilty. Murder perhaps. All they want to do is die their life is broken. Sickness has overwhelm them. They just want to go. Im the only guy who understands why she wants to go. And I couldnt do anything to stop it. Its her vessel...the only thing stopping me is my love for her. So I made her suffer more by not dying. Sacrificed her happiness for me. Selfish of me from my pov. Tremendous love and compassion cant solve everything.",
    "Dating a person with major depressive disorder I have already posted this on the depression subreddit but Im afraid that nobody make comments. Hi, so I started dating this boy that since the begining told me he has major depressive disorder, I dont know a lot about that but now Im making reasearch. Yesterday he told me that he is going to hospitalize himself and that he does this frequently to keep the disorder controled. I really like him, he is a great person and I want to be with him so I want to ask for advice, experiences or tips to make this work and to understand him.",

His family and friends went along with it but none of them is willing to apologize or acknowledge any wrongdoing. His mother told me, Being nice is overrated. I am so sad I dont want to live anymore. I dont know how to cope with the suffering I experience on a daily basis. Ill appreciate any advice you have for me.",
    "feeling lost and lonely I have zero friends and its been that way since grade 10 so give or take 4 or 5 years. I had a friend group in my freshman year but I found myself less happy around them and when i went to a new high school i distanced myself from everyone and this is where it all started. Found myself insecure around others and got really uncomfortable out of nowhere. im now 20, never been to a party and have zero friends and when someone tries to be friends with me i think its weird. Ive only had toxic relationships my whole life. Between friendships and a couple relationships. Im a talented, funny, really likeable girl but i dont think i can relax around people and enjoy it at all. tbh i hate it. i dont wanna be like this forever im extremely lonely but this has been a ongoing problem for years and i feel like im experiencing a much deeper mental disorder than i let on. i just dont know what it is. Im EXTREMELY insecure also. Because im alone 247 and never chat with anyone and have no family, my thoughts drive me insane and there SO loud. I have fun by getting drunk alone in my room. My depression has turned physical and ive been experiencing intense chest tightening to the point where it feels like im struggling to breathe and ive been trying to distress and balance it out a bit. I spend hours a day in my room daydreaming and talking to myself. Its what i enjoy now and the most fun i have. I feel disconnected from my surroundings and reality. I just dont know what to do i fear im stuck here forever. Can anyone atleast somewhat relate? What can i do?",
    "puberty? attention? depression? everytime i think to myself that i might have depression, it just hits me that this is just puberty, im just seeking attention and whatnot, i feel really unhappy, i started wanting to eat less, wary of my weight i am very selfconscious and I cant sleep without using my phone to sleep, i feel like im such a failure to my parents who are trying to raise me with their best, i always tried my best to be a good child to them, not doing what they didnt want, but i felt like i suddenly changed, i didnt want to be a good kid anymore, following all the rules and having to hide whats not good within me, i just wanted to be who i am without trying to hide it from them like its such a crime, but I cant because im too afraid, i want to be honest with them and relieve this feeling off my chest but I cant, i always think theyll probably think that im just wanting attention, I dont want to be ashamed, i dont like the feeling of embarrassment, i just want to be alone, away from everything but i want to talk at the same time, its just that i always rethink it, when i think of talking with someone, my mind just rethinks everything and i eventually end up not talking with someone, so i wanted to talk here, with more responsible people than me I could also be probably just too self conscious, I dont know, im doubting myself with everything i think which could be the reason, making me not come up with an answer, Ive also been feeling empty for a very long time, i could laugh and be happy at times but it doesnt feel right, like theres something missing, i dont have any traumas that i can remember to be a source, im an introvert who dislikes social interaction and is comfortable isolated, i have thanatophobia which I dont remember having a trauma of either but i suddenly get panic attacks as if im being choked and my brain just goes blank, which i havent told my parents about either but i had a panic attack before in front of them which probably just seemed like i was just feeling unwell or something to them i think, i only remember it vaguely which is why i dont really remember what happened but I do remember them being passive about it ?, considering everything was completely normal and i dont remember them asking me why i acted like that, and right now as im typing, i feel like im making my parents look shitty even if theyre not and i know they dont deserve it and im just rambling stupidly like this but i felt like i just had to open up everything i hadnt told them since i developed bottling up my feelings instead of talking im probably better gone, but i dont want to leave my parents am i depressed or just over reacting? or attentionseeking?",
    "How can I (28f) help my Mum (56f) who is depressed and considering suicide. Grandmas health has been worsening and Grandma is resisting the idea of going into a care home. Although Mum isnt dealing with Grandmas care anymore she is still stressed about it. She believes she is getting bullied at work claims to be getting coldshouldered and that people are hiding her belongings. She has worked there for about 10 years without incident before now and I have not seen any other evidence for this aside from her word which I do not consider trustworthy in her current state. I have tried to help her by Convincing her to begin antidepressants again which she is refusing to do, she will get fat again. To at least see a therapist she is refusing to as it doesnt work, also the only counselor in town is one of her cousins who she has been fighting with see above, I asked if she would consider travelling to see someone in another town or even zoom sessions with someone but she still steadfastly refused. I did ensure that she has helpline numbers easily accessible saved in her mobile, on the fridge and beside all the landlines in the house. Encouraging her to reach out to her friends and have a coffee or meal together she refuses to ask because she believes they will reject her invite, a why bother mentality. She also refuses to go out when they do invite her to things because she doesnt feel like it. Actively making plans with her which she has always bailed on despite apparent excitement beforehand. I have been in contact with several of her close friends and explained my concerns which they have shared and asked if they can make special effort to explicitly include her when getting together which I know they have as we have been in ongoing contact but she still has not been engaging. Taking all her calls and trying to gently help her see that some of her present mindsets are distorted when she calls I want her to recognise that she needs help so hopefully she will be open to trying something. Offering to pay dues for any clubs or organisations she would like to try as she claims she can not afford them. Offering suggestions of free community events she can attend. I also offered to attend with her if she would like she took this offer as an insult that she needed supervision.",

Im also in uni and its frustrating, ive been convincing myself to atleast pass the courses im taking and thats it and i let that took a toll on me. I feel so lazy, unmotivated, i sleep alot, always on my phone and only do my assignments last minute despite how hard i try to plan it beforehand.

I dont feel real anymore I just want to be me again. I thought it was being unemployed that made it bad but I have a job now and I feel even worse. Ive called the suicide line a few times and the only time its helped has been once and every other time Ive been mocked or talked down to. I sound like the most self centred asshole whos just spoilt and doesnt see what I have I know. I have that chance to get counselling and the chance to get medication at all and for free.

    "Am I depressed? *trigger warning* I, 23 Male have been feeling weird FOR YEARS. I dont really know if Im depressed or not because I have never been to therapy and probably never will because Its hella expensive from where Im from. I dont want to selfdiagnose my depression because I just find that weird and wrong. I was 12 when I first harmed myself, I dont think I did it a lot but back then, I just thought I was just influenced with the whole emo phase a lot of people my age then was so into. I had a few attempts growing up, and thats when I started thinking maybe I really am depressed, because even If i didnt do it constantly throughout the years since I first did it, there would be days where I thought dying would just be the best option because I felt so shitty all the time. I googled the symptoms of depression as I grew older and would relate to most of it, BUT i still could not find myself to think that I am depressed since I have not even checked in with a professional. Today, I have been feeling so bad about everything, I could explain In details about my life but It wont be necessary for this post. Some days theres a reason for me to be sad, and some days I just dont know whats the root of my sadness. I would just feel like shit even though I had a great day, and I could never really point out WHY im sad and it frustrates me until I cry and just try to exhaust myself and sleep and hope that I feel better when I wake up. Someone, please help, I really dont know what I could do anymore. Im losing my mind and I just want to figure out whats going on with me and I dont think I could keep playing this guessing game with myself for the rest of my life. It makes me feel so miserable. I just want to be aware of what the hell is happening with me.",
    "Today I was one step away from killing myself. Today I was one step away from killing myself. Long story short  I had a girlfriend. Weve been best friends for 7 years. The first 2 years I treated her only as a friend, but after 2 years I realized that I fell in love with her. Almost immediately I told her about it and was sent to the friend zone. But every year I fell in love with her more and more. I have never loved anyone so much, and I have never had such a friend. This year she found herself a new boyfriend. And in the end, she said that she no longer has time to communicate with me, and it would be better if we stop communicating. She threw me away like trash. I was left without friends, in a deep depression, absolutely psychologically broken. Every night I fall asleep with the thought that I want to die in my sleep, and every morning I regret that I am still alive. The only thing that keeps me from killing myself is my family. I know that if I commit suicide, my parents will not survive it. But today she posted a photo on Instagram, where her boyfriend picks strawberries, with the caption Happiness is when your man collects strawberries for you while you chill on the bench. And at that moment I was more than ever close to ending my life. For a minute, I stopped thinking about my parents, about anything else, and just wanted to go and cut my throat, or veins. Every day I want to live less and less, because I no longer have a future, there are no hopes and dreams, and I am drowning in darkness and depression. I dont think I can endure this until the end of the year and not end up with my miserable aimless existence. And so that everything is not so depressing  I am absolutely seriously going to get myself 2 tattoos this year a small trash can somewhere on my leg, and the inscription Loser on my arm. Because if I have understood anything over the past 11 years, during which I have visited 8 friend zones, it is that I am a loser, but this year I realized that I am trash",
    "I’m sick of everything, my life is just meant to be miserable. Its a long post, but I will appreciate any feedback from anyone who decides to read it! My struggle with depression started around 20172018. Im currently 18yo. Sometimes Im more stable than the other day, there are the times that Im capable of controlling how I response to big waves of emotions. But its never totally gone, it likes to come back and my behavior is often caused by some unhealed memories or habits from my lowest times. I get embarrassed when I get emotionally involved into a conversation, I hate the thought of making my mental health an excuse, but sometimes I just feel like I just ran a marathon, I lay down and I cant help but cry because of such a failure my life is and how weak I am. I have an abusive father, my family and I tried everything to solve problems and help him change but he wont listen to anyone. Our family is pretty much divided to responsible men my oldest brother and my father and women that should do everything around the house so everyone else, especially my father, can live comfortably. I have five siblings. Since Im the oldest girl Im expected to be the major housekeeper except my mom. Im also the one with the most sense of being fair and respectful towards what I have and whats given to me, thats why I rarely skip my responsibilities or deny any request or help. I feel overwhelmed about the amount of stuff I need to do, not to mention the way my parents treat me when something is not done perfectly. I graduated high school with average results, Im neither the smartest nor the dumbest person on earth. I dont have any specific abilities nor passions to pick a solid university major that would make me happy and open a career path that would let me sustain myself. Now that I can apply to college, my score is slightly beyond the minimum. I picked a major about Korea, the country and the language, its something I got interested in, I am studying Korean for a while. But when I realized how much points you have to have to get accepted I lost any excitement that I had, I barely meet the requirements, most people have tens of points more. I dont stand out in any way. I was never liked at school.",
    "What is it normal to feel after a suicide attempt? This is possibly triggering for a lot of people. On Tuesday evening I tried to end my life but obviously was unsuccessful. I was taken to the hospital and given all the treatment. Spoke to a man who is a mental health specialist then I went home. I dont know what I feel. I guess I feel extremely anxious. I feel like I should be more sad or depressed than I am. But honestly I feel numb. I feel guilty for laughing or smiling with my dad he doesnt know because that means Im fake and I didnt really mean my attempt. Im still getting those thoughts. The more I think of them the more my anxiety increases and I feel like now Ive pushed past the fear and done something, the uncertainty is not there anymore and it will be easier to next time.",
    "I get attached too easily and it just leads to pain I get attached to people too easily. This is really bad when Im down and a person helps me out. The latest example was someone I met on Reddit. I thought we hit it off friendship wise but then I must have said something dumb. 2 weeks nonstop chatting and then in 15 minutes... just gone. Now Im lost. I needed that. That was my happiness. After I was ghosted my heart just fell out of my body and I immediately started going into a depressive phase again. I need support. I need to know what to do. I even just need someone to talk to because life just... sucks right now.",
    "My life is amazing, but I'm a miserable asshole. I'm not sure what to do. I have been in quite a few abusive relationships romantic and platonic so I know theres some trauma Im still working through. But the problem is that despite all the progress Ive made and all the wonderful things in my life, I cant feel any of that wonderfulness. I see my wife, I know I love her, I can act on that love, but I cant... feel it. Its just numb. I watch a show that makes me happy, and I just cant... feel that happiness. Its like Im constantly, permanently disconnected from anything positive, and no matter how healthy my habits might become or what attitudes I choose to adopt, neutral is the best I feel about anything. On top of that, its like Ive forgotten how to have fun. I have hobbies that I never pursue. Ill buy something, say a video game, and never play it. I have a pile of books Ive bought but never read, and sadly, its not because Im just too slow at getting through them. Its like, when I try to do something that isnt work, I get these voices not literal in my head screaming you shouldnt be doing this. The more I try to have fun, the worse I feel about it. I mentioned I just graduated college  three years at a community college couldve been 1 12, thanks shitty counselling department! and 2 years at UCSD. I graduated  though there wasnt a ceremony or anything thanks Covid  and felt... nothing. I didnt feel pride, or relief, or anything. It was like Id just finished washing the dishes  okay, thats done, whats next? A couple of years back, I got my black belt in a very difficult martial art after 7 years of training three times a week. The test was a fourhour ordeal that literally involved, at one point, blood streaming down my face as I fought a marine twice my size they paused it for a few minutes so I could clean myself up. When they announced the results a few days later, I didnt feel pride, or accomplishment.",
    "Yesterday Was Rough To catch you up Ive dealt with depression, anxiety, and parasuicidal thoughts for over 30 years, since before I was 10. My wife and I are currently separated as we both deal with our individual issues with depression, anxiety, etc, as well as seek couples counseling. We have been married 8 years, together 10, and have a 2 12 year old son. ampx200B Last Friday, I was given an ultimatum at work. I am the director of advertising amp marketing for one of the largest independent automotive groups in the Southeast United States. I was told, in so many words, that I had a week to prove my worth or lose my job. Never mind that I have reduced our spending by 45 since I started, and brought in triple my salary in additional new business due to digital marketing efforts I implemented in the organization, all the while maintaining the original sales output of our business. I was given exactly zero direction as to how to prove my worth. Needless to say, the last week has only served to heighten my stress and anxiety. ampx200B Ive never been a very physically affectionate person. I get that from my mom, a survivor of sexual abuse when she was a child. But yesterday, I really needed a hug from my wife. I just wanted to hold her in my arms, breathe in her scent, and feel like everything was going to be alright. ampx200B I realize, cognitively, that this process is a good thing for our lives. We are on the road to personal healing and healing as a couple. But that doesnt make this season any easier, and a hug from my little boy doesnt do for me what one from my wife would.",
    "Staying POSITIVE is ALREADY hard and now I am the caregiver to a SUICIDAL FRIEND Hi guys, I dont know if this is the right forum for my overall mixed content. Im 23 F. And I need some advice on my situation. Appreciate it if yall could share with me your thoughts. To start off, I have both anxiety and depression. I know that with those 2, it definitely would be a roller coaster ride with my emotions and I am familiar with this as it is like a cycle that I kept having to go through. I would say that my depression is not as severe as my anxiety though. So back to my main story. Recently I have been busy trying to help a suicidal friend. I have known her for 7 years plus and am aware that she was suffering from depression. I always thought that it was going to be okay as time goes by but then I realized it worsened. She was really going all out on ending her life that I had to call the police on her. Thing is, she has been planning out her will and settling whatever she considered as necessity for the preparation of her demise. Its like i am scared but I have no choice to take charge as she does not have a good rs with her family. I managed to persuade her to go and seek help from the professional. She was adamant but somehow agreed eventually. First medication didnt work so we changed to another type. End up, she decided to stop taking the medication all by herself. She went MIA for about a week or so. When she finally texted, it was bad news  she was prepping to end her life. I had to call the police on her. Apparently she lied to them that she was okay and would be attending her appointment, so they couldnt do anything in my country the police can only intervene if you are caught in the act of committing suicide. However later on she berated me as she felt that I had betrayed her. She however continued to confide in me. I was pretty much unsure what to do so I wrote a letter to the family secretly I know where she stays and i made sure to text her mum that I had put a letter outside their house gate.",
    "Your experiences with Vortioxetine (Trintellix) or Tranylcypromine (Parnate) for Social Anxiety Your experiences with Vortioxetine Trintellix or Tranylcypromine Parnate for Social Anxiety I would love to hear about your experiences with Trintellix andor Parnate especially regarding social anxiety. I tried all the SSRIs and SNRIs as well as one MAOI and one tricyclic. No effects at all except sexual side effects. I also tried 3 talk therapies already 2 depth psychological and 1 behavioral Im doing right now. I want to have a crutch that helps me socializing and finally living life.

    "How do I convince my parents to let me see a therapist? Basically, they are the religiousskeptical type, so they think God can cure my depression if you believe in that all the power to you but didnt work for me and now Im basically atheist, not trying to disrespect anybody though. And yeah, so they refuse to get me an actual therapist for around 5 years now Ive had depression and they knew the whole time, Ive self harmed, came close to committing suicide, starved myself a bit, and skipped tons of school over those 5 years. Still no help, even after I got school counselors involved in middle school, they barely did anything. But to give them credit, they somewhat tried to get help after I involved counselors from school, only since it was basically required. Except this person they chose to be my therapist was the pastor of a church I go to, and he invalided everything I felt, and even worse last summer he practically made fun of teens with depression and said it was just mood swings and it was fake. Dumb stuff like that. I dont want to make this post any longer then it needs to be, but thats a tiny bit of background. I just want a bit of advice on convincing them, because I seriously need help. Any tips on how you the reader convinced your parents, or tips on making them believe therapy works would be helpful. Thank you.",

    "Advice coming off meds Hi, just wanting some advice. Over the past year I developed pretty significant anxiety and depression, and after a while, my friends at uni noticed and advised that I seek professional help. I was then prescribed antidepressants sertraline, which Ive been taking for the past few months. Things overall improved over the summer, but about a week ago I decided to stop taking them, as I dont feel very comfortable being reliant on medication, and I feel like my life is at a significantly better point now. I recognise that this was probably the wrong call, and if things get worse again I will get back on them. However, since coming off them, Ive been experiencing almost constant headaches and dizziness, to the point where I am sometimes unable to walk, meaning its difficult leaving the house, or meeting up with anybody, as I feel like I cant maintain the required amount of energy. This means my lifestyle has reverted to what it was like at the worst points of the last year, being unable to go outside, and feeling unable to talk to anybody on any medium. Does anybody know how long these effects last or if theyre normal?",

My factors involved include me losing my first child, a son at 5 mos from a rare genetic condition. I also suffer from bipolar depression and constantly struggling.

    "Please help me She the new GP knows that I am diagnosed with two chronic painful diseases but she refused to give me any painkillers because just a paracetamol should be enough. I still need to wait a whole month to be able to visit my gyn, the only person that seems to care about my pain. So I am at home with no painkillers, in daily pain and so weak that folding the laundry makes me pant from the effort. I kept going to the same therapist but she is clearly not prepared to deal with chronic pain. I told her three times that i have daily suicidal thoughts and she just changes topic, she wont adress it. Also she gives me stupid advice that is incompatible with my diseases. In our last session she told me that I should consider working as a gardener again. How? Doing basic housechores is a nightmare for me, how I am suposed to do an incredibly physical job???? I am not going back... Then its the issue with my money. As I didnt had a job except the few months gardening in three years I barely have any money left I spent my savings doing a Master before coming ti Belgium. I cant sustain myself and I am compeltely dependent on my partner. I tried aplying for disability but as a migrant not only I dont have any right to get help but the social worker told me that if I dont find a job in two years when my status is reviewed I will likely be kicked out of Belgium. I will become a homeless person. To apply for any help in Spain I just need to work 12 months.... And then there is the issue with my partner. He loves me and tries to suport me. But he really doesnt want to hear about my pain or depression, I cant talk to him about anything that worries me. He simply doesnt care. He also refuses to do any house chores. He forces his SICK girlfriend to do all housechores walking the dog, cleaning, cooking, laundry, gardening, garbage.... He doesnt care that I am in pain or sick, he will simply not help me.",
    "Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result Basically, I feel like Im doing all the things that someone with depression is supposed to do. I exercise, eat relatively healthily, maintain several close relationships with friends and family, take medication and vitamins, go to therapy, try to keep busy but not burn out... And Im still stuck. Theres no situational issues or any residual trauma that makes me feel this way. Ive just always been depressed, which runs in my family. It makes me think of the quote, The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. I feel like Im just working WAY too hard to stay afloat, doing the same things every day and expecting that eventually Ill feel better. I dont want to give up. Im NOT going to give up. I just feel crazy, I feel like all of my energy is going towards keeping myself alive, and I dont have any room to just BREATHE. Ive had to leave work early or call in sick a few times in the last few weeks because I couldnt stop crying about nothing. Im so stressed by just doing my basic daily routine that I have kind of a meltdown every night when I get home from work. My days off are equally difficult. I try to do the things that I know bring me joy, even when I dont feel it. Im just starting to feel a little bit insane expecting things to get better without some sort of change, and I feel that Im running out of options for things to change or improve.",
    "Everything is going downhill again. I felt that for a couple months things were going well and I was finally on track to getting my life together. this pandemic has kind of uprooted everything and I feel super isolated and demotivated again. I cant get myself out of bed most days let alone study for my degree im a med student, exercise or eat. The main thing is I just think about how much of a failure I am, how everyone hates me and how worthless I am. Anyone got experience with getting themselves out of a rut like thiscurrently feeling the same?",
    "Should I click yes to give the psychiatrist permission to share my information with one of my parents? What are they gonna share? So I finally opened to my parents that Ive been struggling with depression, but didnt tell them the exact main reason why because of how much embarrassment and shame I feel over it. Theyve been supportive and let me set up an appointment with a psychiatrist. Theres a part that asks if they have permission to share my information with them. I really dont want them knowing about the real reason why Im depressed. I feel like Im obligated to click yes because I am on their insurance. What should I do?",
    "Help -self harmed for the first time Throwaway account. Background Im 16 and have struggled with moderate to severe depression for about a year now. It came out of the blue, although Ive had anxiety for a while. Depression runs strongly in my family so not altogether surprised. Ive struggled so much with lethargy, apathy, hopelessness, imposter syndrome and feeling like people think Im better than I am, and generally feeling like a useless human. I still love myself and always will, but Ive started to really doubt my capabilities and Im not sure how much of what my brain tells me are actually lies. ampx200B Anyway, last night I had a breakdown and was really struggling to communicate how I was feeling to my parents. I know they love me, but I dont think they entirely understand whats going on for me. My mom was trying to get me to exercise to combat the depression but my body felt like a bag of rocks and I just didnt have any willpower left so I just refused. So my mom got super angry and eventually I just collapsed in the bathroom. I dont know what made me do it, but I ran to my room with these really sharp tweezers and cut up my legs and made them bleed. I counted and it seems there are about 40 scratches that bled, plus a zillion more before it got more intense ampx200B Thats the first time Ive ever hurt myself on purpose, and now Im scared that I might do it again. Because the pain felt good, it burned and the adrenaline rush felt like a drug and I didnt feel so passive anymore. But now that I have my thinkingfeeling brain back I feel guilty and Im afraid that having done it once means I could easily do it again. Because I dont feel like it was really me that did it, it was like my depression monster climbed out and possessed me, and that could happen again. What should I do? Has anyone else experienced this and have advice? Im honestly kind of scared, now that I know what Im capable of. I never thought Id be the kind of person to self harm",
    "Is there a point? Im 19, super bad social anxiety to the point where I cant even go down to the corner store anymore. Im constantly in fear of being judged due to my gynamastia or whatever tf its called. I had a couple friends in highschool but when I dropped out I started getting more depressed to the point where I didnt want anyone around me in fear of me making them sad. I cant talk to people, I just shut down when someone says anything to me and people now think Im a weirdo who doesnt talk. So even if I wanted to open up theyd just think Im more weird right? I just want a friend... Or to not have to kill myself cause at this point it seems the only plausible option.",
    "I'm so close to giving up Im so close to giving up on everything. For the last two weeks my mind has been in shit because someone I cared about betrayed me. They did something which could ruin my life and has given me severe trust issues for the foreseeable future. Because of this Ive started losing interest in every I used to enjoy. I used to love going to training but Im beginning to think whats the point. As well my mind is starting to become self destructive. So many times these last 2 weeks, I havent been able to look at myself in a mirror without saying something I hate about myself. Its brought me so close to the edge of hurting myself and Im beginning to lose it. I just want to have some I can trust and care about. But Im getting so paranoid that everyone I like and know just hates me. Its gotten to the stage where im talking to people I like, and Im over analyzing everything they say, thinking theyre just saying it out of pity for me. I just want someone, anyone to care about me. But I know no one ever will. Im starting to think that theres no point in existing since no one would miss me if Im gone. I feel Im just annoying everyone I talk to and Im just a burden on everyone.",
    "No one to vent to Is it normal to feel like you have no one to vent to? I dont have friends but I vent to one of my parents occasionally or occasionally a sibling. But sometimes I just feel worse afterwards like they dont really understand or they make the conversation about them and what they would do. I guess I could try therapy again but my past therapists would try to lighten the mood. And I felt like I was going to therapy just because I feel lonely but it seems like therapists need you to have goals and I dont know my goals. I feel like my emotions are too much for people. Even the occasional time I share my upset I feel guilty for getting upset at the person and like I should be less sensitive.",
    "When it gets better, it just gets bad again Im having a really bad day. Nothing particularly bad actually happened but I feel so down that I dont even want to move. Ive been dealing with this for over 25 years now, since I was a child and Im so frustrated. If Im having a good day, I know in the back of my mind it can be bad again the next day and I never really truly enjoy it. Im in therapy, on meds, I exercise, I work, but no matter what I do, the depression always comes back. What else can I do? How can I live the rest of my life like this?",
    "Should I kill myself? I am the most uninteresting person and I feel like I am the only one who puts effort into any of my relationships. I loved gsming with her, or playing piano for her. Not feeling uptight in this relationship like the last. But yet it still feels like its coming to an end soon and I cant believe this is happening again. I really want it to work but idk what to do. I tried reaching out to friends more and making new friends but its more of me putting sll the effort. No one is responsive. Like I dont need to talk about my girlfriend or the relationship, I just want to distract myself and have people there so I feel cared for. I am stuck in this spot I was in, in 2020 again. I am about to be alone again. I of course have not told my girlfriend about these thoughts, not her problem. But like I feel like my life is going to be this cycle of me craving attention and chasing others away. I cant live in this constant cycle. Love isnt worth it, if it always ends in a break up. I have no close friends so I am going to be alone. Like am I just bound to suffer. I dont even think I enjoy cs anymore, but it feels too late to go into music or business. Plus I dont have the contacts for business. My career feels hopeless, my relationships feel hopeless, and being more confident one day feels like a longshot. So here I am thinking to myself, do I end it? Is it worth the continual suffering? Is this relationship hopeless? Will I find friends that I can connect with? Will I become a better person? Will I succeed? I dont know, and at this point, it feels like I should give up.",
    "Spiraling out of control I can confidently say this is the hardest my depression has hit me in the 10 years Ive been struggling. I find myself so angry, lashing out at people who love me and just destroying everyone in my path. I just wish I could have a second chance at this. I am super hard on myself and cannot seem to control the negative self talk. I beat myself up over everything, especially not being able to control my emotions. Ive seen so many mental health professionals that I just get tired of telling my story over and over again. Committing myself to therapy or standing psych appointments seems more exhausting than suffering alone. I dont know what advice Im exactly looking for, so please forgive me if this is all over the place. Im just desperate. Im thinking ending my life, but Im definitely too much of a coward to carry it out. Any input or kind words are welcomed. Thank you",

Since then, I have been battling on and off with these intense feelings of sadness and worthlessness. Everybody seems to be adulting so well. I feel like Im the only one who cant cope. I dont know what I want in my life. I have no passion for anything. No values, ideals, goalsnothing. When I try to find something that I might be interested it, it starts off well but I am eventually overwhelmed by crippling fear and anxiety. I am at a point where I feel like I dont deserve to be good enough. I cry a lot. I feel like a failure. I feel like I have failed my parents expectations of me. I feel like I have failed everyone around me, I feel like I have failed myself. The only expectations Ive ever had for myself were to at least meet the expectations of the people who literally sacrificed their time and money to raise me. They didnt have to Im kind of adopted, but they did. But even that I cant do. I just wanted so much to be someone who has made their parents proud. I have now moved away from home and work as an English teacher abroad. I really needed a break from everyones expectations. And I thought that moving halfway across the world would help me with that. But clearly, it has not. Because have to deal with everyones expectations of me here as well. And I am not coping well. I always tell myself to be tough, suck it up.

    "I feel hopelessly inferior to everyone around me Its like there is the level of common understanding or thought that everyone else has but me. Its really hard to put into words because its just a feeling i get when i am outside, or seeing videos on the internet. Its like other people know what to say or how to act in situations im utterly lost in. And I also feel inferior because everyone else has so much experience and i havent had any. I feel like a sheltered baby compared to just my peers. They hook up, they smoketake drugs, go to bars and parties. I dont do any of that, still a fucking virgin. And when conversations inevitably get around to those topics, i feel terrible. I feel inferior, ashamed of myself, and lots guilt and self loathing. I think part of the guilt and self loathing comes from one of my initial reactions being hatred. I dont want to hate them, that doesnt make any sense because i want to be like them and theyre just living their best lives. But i do feel hatred because they not only get to casually do what i have cried myself to sleep wishing i could do. And then i turn that on myself. I shouldnt hate them, im a terrible person for thinking that. Thinking that makes you an incelneckbeardcreep. Its so grating to my ears to hear my neighbor having friends over or parties, or to hear people walking by outside on their way to a party or even just get some food. And i makes me want to slam my head. I know i can never get better if i think like this. But ill probably just never get better, period. Because i suck at socializing. I dont get invited to things. I dont have anyone to invite to get something going myself. I suck. Worthless, sack of shit. Better off dead",

    "How to get through depression as a young adult ? Hello... Im new to reddit, and joined this sub because Ive been dealing with depression since the beginning of my teenage years and wanted to ask you guys and especially those who found a way out of depression how did you manage to get through it ? Im only 18, ik im still young and all but I feel so empty and worthless, crying and thinking about killing myself everyday. I dont have any objective to focus on in my life that could help me cheer up and fight for. Of course I spoke with therapists but didnt keep up with the sessions because everytime I talk about my problems and my past I start crying and panicking, which makes me think even more that Im helpless and makes me hate those sessions... Also, I find them useless for therapists say things that are really obvious, like if you want to have friends and go out with them, just ask people of your class to hang with you, well thanks, but the real issue is that I cant find the motivation and courage to talk to people since I always fear to be rejected. Thats for this type of answer I put an end on the sessions. My parents know that theres something off about me but Ive always done my best in hiding how bad I feel because ik they wouldnt understand, since all they do is making jokes about my sad facial expression when I eat with them... And I have literally 0 friends IRL who I could talk to about that, only online buddies that try to cheer me up sometimes, but I can tell that they get tired of it and I cant blame them for it, ik it is hard to try helping someone but things just remain the same. I really want to get out of this situation... Thank you for reading, and sorry for the grammar mistakes, Im french .",

You might find something that was really hidden in your subconsciousness. ampx200B Well, thats what I did. ampx200B I am going to tell the story of my life.

So I was born in Brazil one of the reasons that Im writing in English its because Im the only one in the family who speaks a little bit of English. So Im sorry if theres some bad English here. The city that I was born is really violent, which is the reason why my mother wasnt very pleased with the idea of me going to play with other kids in the neighborhood.

    "Do you feel the lack of executive function is a bigger/ more important symptom than your mood? Ive been thinking about this lately because Im trying to adjust my meds. Im looking at all the impacts and side effects of the medications Ive been prescribed before and the ones my doctor wants to now prescribe for me and I feel like they all try to fix the low mood problem you making everything worse. The actual impact of this stuff working is inability to complete tasks, lack of motivation, lethargy etc. I want to try something that helps with executive function while staying on what helps with low mood.

    "I got cheated on by my now ex-boyfriend of six years and I feel worthless We ended up getting to the venue early enough where the line was already forming. We decided to stay and just wait it out. During this time I noticed he was texting someone a lot. I read the name and realized it wasnt someone I was familiar with. I clicked on me what might be happening, with being on the verge of a panic attack I asked him if he was talking to someone else and he could just as nswr honestly. He told me no, that it was just a girl that was a friend. I wasnt buying it. We went through the concert. Went to the local bars had two drinks and headed back to the Airbnb. I didnt want to be the fool so I did what needed to be done where I could get answers. I looked through his phone. Sure enough, he was talking to someone else. I didnt know how to handle the situation but I knew I needed to make aware the other party of my presence. I told them who I was, how long Ive known him, and the status we were in. I then added them on Snapchat and sent them pictures of us through the years to proof that I wasnt lying and that I wasnt just anyone. As soon as he woke up he saw his phone and knee something was up because she sent him a message. That if he had a girlfriend that he should have told her that way she would have kept it more friendly. I ended up messaging her for quite a while and basically becoming more aware of the situation as he had lied to her as well that he hadnt been dating me since August. He wouldnt speak to me and he wouldnt care to admit that he was a liar and cheater. He decided he would be taking an Uber to the bus station because he couldnt stand being with me. It didnt work out as plan and he ended up leaving back home with me. Once we got closer I confronted him. I couldnt keep in what I was thinking and wanted to let him know what I felt. It sucked. He said he hadnt loved me for a while.",

    "I'm seriously considering suicide again. Im getting tired of posting here repeatedly, not because of the sub itself actually, it helped me go through tough times but because I have no one else to talk to except internet strangers. The post is long, bear with me. This might be my last post, and I want to have to get some things out of my chest. I am very tired, and havent been really feeling anything since yesterday, after I got back from Chicago, so it might be a bit messy, and just... not organized at all. But here goes Im so lonely. I want people to like me. But all I am is a waste. A waste of time, resources, and opportunities. By no means am I the unluckiest person around. I have an above average IQ 152 WISC, 149 WAIS, I have certain traits that Id like to be proud of, such as being orderly and responsible, speaking 3 languages fluently EN, ES, KR and 2 languages in the beginner level FR and ZH and know a couple of more alphabets like Cyrillic, Greek and Yiddish, and I absolutely love to learn, read, and to experience. but somehow, even with all that, I managed to be the biggest fucking trainwreck I could possibly imagine. My father locked me in dark rooms for hours when I was 3 to 5. I was diagnosed w T1D when I was 5. I was always a bit weak, underweight. I started having behavioral problems since 10, including but not limited to violent tendencies, compulsive lying, stealing I dont know if its kleptomania, I hope its not. But even if it is, wont make another difference. Just another problem on my list, etc. I was diagnosed with Night Terrors and Bipolar Depression when I was 12, 13 maybe. I have suffered from achluophobia and a mild claustrophobia, as well as some social issues. I wont label my social issues, as I havent got a clinical diagnosis like anyhting else on this list, but I think it fits more into the antisocial category than asocial or social anxiety, because of my negative and possibly misanthropist views.",

I want the power to love, I am a Roman Catholic and every night and morning I pray, read the Bible and ask to God to give me the power to be happy and give me the gift of love and hope, to remove my extreme anxiety, I want to receive true love but I also want to give true love, I have been assisting to some masses in the Church near my university and I have cried when the priest meditates some passages I can identify with or gives us the command to offer each other the sign of peace because its the only thing that I feel that loves me. The only thing that keeps me going is that I know I am in my most critical moment and when things start to get better or I am at my peak in life I want to be able to look back to these moments and say wow, that was really my lowest point to never repeat it again.

    "I really need some advice to fix my life.. I want to apologize for my English, everything i learned was from video games,movies,youtube etc.. Hi. My name is Nick and i want to share my story.. i live in a small town in Greece, im 17 years old i live with my mother and i am morbidly obese 150kg 1.72 height my max weight was 196. 2 years ago i lost my father from obesity he had many difficulties in the last years of his life with obesity, diabetes, Cushings syndrome, hormonal issues and more.. i had to watch him suffer for a good chunk of my life so did my mother and my 2 older brothers, after losing him my mother lost it she doesnt think properly anymore and that leads to many bad decisions more smoking, pills, gambling and she doesnt take care of her self.. she eats rarely even tho i try to convince her to eat she refuses. My whole life i was overweight and didnt really have that many friends and most of them only wanted to take advantage of me because of money or something else and that lead to many trust issues low selfesteem and loneliness.. growing up i never had anyone to talk to because my brothers did not really care back then and my parents were very busy working.. they tried to replace love and care with money and gifts so i spent a lot of time by myself in our home not going outside but it didnt bother me back then because it felt normal that way and soon i started to have an interest to the internet and computers in general video games youtube hardware etc etc and thats where the whole started going downhill.. i didnt have space for a computer back then because i shared my room with my brothers so i started going to internet cafes near me and i would spend all of my money to buy more playtime and prepaid cards for games.. every day i was getting more and more addicted to the internet and that lead to less time outside, less physical activity, more and more weight gain and i started skipping school. My social skills were and still are very poor so talking to people thru social media made it easier for me to communicate with others and make some friends so thats what i did and because of that i found some amazing people that i had lots of fun with and kept me distracted from my real life problems.",

In middle and elementary school teachers would always criticize me and call me dumb and slow, they told me the only thing I could ever achieve in the future is working at a fast food restaurant. My mom sometimes would call me dumb too. I guess you could say it stuck? I started doing well in the beginning of highschool because I didnt want my mom to see me as a disappointment anymore. It was a struggle grinding 7 hours everyday and now I feel like i cant do it at least for now anymore. Its the end of the first semester and I still have 16 assignments to do.

    "I'm 16 and I'm a mess sorry in advance for bad grammar I dont remember when it started. It was weird, realizing how much I stopped enjoying most things. My favorite video games werent as exciting anymore. I wasnt as interested in anime and Manga anymore, I didnt feel like consuming it either. My days became boring, each one beginning with the envy of enjoying something that I used to love and each of them ending with this overwhelming feeling of regret. I was more angry, I ranted with myself a lot about stupid things, I was crying more, most of the time because of stupid things albeit that started a chain of thoughts leading to more serious issues and regrets. And mostly, I was so tired man, and it just gets worse and worse. Its to a point where it feels crippling, like I cant do anything anymore that requires a minimum of effort. I dont understand. Lots of times, I wasnt even sure if I really had something. Maybe Im just too lazy? Maybe Im just tired? Is it really depression? But why? Why would I have these thoughts, when others are having a it so much worse than me? I dont understand. I feel so overwhelmed by myself. Sometimes I want to confess to someone, to tell them everything I have on my mind, but now I just feel like there is so much that I dont even know where to begin. Nowadays, I cant even make the effort of talking to my friends. Im scared that Ill lose them. Im scared Im not being a good enough friend, Im scared Im isolating from them and they will just go, Im scared that Im not enjoy their presence enough and I know I will regret just lie everything else. I know I can make them laugh and smile but I feel like I cant even do that properly anymore, like Im slowly losing this ability, I feel like Im not as interesting as I used to be, or as I could be, I feel like Im not as funny, and I feel so much more things that I cant even begin to list.

    "Struggling with health services, would like some advice (23F) For the first time in years after being the support for my other half who has struggled with anxiety and depression, I find myself on the other side of the fence. I have been trying for over a month now to make an appointment with my GP, I have tried calling my local Adult Mental Health Services only to be bluntly told that I have the wrong number I didnt, I live in the county they are responsible for and then hung up on. I then tried calling the nonemergency number for health services and was briefly assessed and told to get to the hospital within the hour to meet a liaison for adult mental health. The liaison spoke to me for a while and she was very comforting and listened to me, and then gave me a leaflet and said to keep trying to ring my GP. I am at the end of my tether  I work very erratic shifts, sometimes early work and sometimes I finish at 2 or 3 AM making it difficult to ring the GP at 8AM to make an appointment. This has been happening for weeks now and Im getting desperate. I just want to get my health sorted so that I can look after my other half.

The gradual cognitive decline is shocking Concentration, alertness, memory, focus, processingrecallingstumbling over words and sentences, confusion, etc.. My motor skills have also declined badly as well.

Its like this is one cruel dream I cant wake up from and the only thing I look forward to is going to sleep to escape from the unsolvable problems in my life and in my head. In the past 2 years my mom, grandma, and dog have died. Ive gotten very sick multiple times and I feel like it gave me brain damage. I cant focus. I went from being a straight A college student to failing multiple classes. Organizing my thoughts is tedious and having the motivation to even think about assignments is a real struggle. I keep putting back on weight and then losing it and gaining it back because I fall into habits that I cant completely break. I live in a run down shack taking care of an elderly person and tiptoeing around my abusive father. I work 3035 hours a week and still cant afford to be on my own. At work I make a mistake every 45 seconds because i cant focus on what needs to be done or analyze the situation. People get angry at me and tell me to just stop trying because I only make things worse. That gets to me the most because I just feel so worthless as it is and now everyone around me is confirming those negative thoughts that I fight so hard to tell myself are just my mind playing tricks. Im literally exactly what I see myself as and the pain that brings make me feel like Im being ripped apart from the inside. I cry myself to sleep, cry when I wake up, and cry in the middle of the day in my car.

Only thing keeping me alive was a quick extreme manic episode where i was going insane. Now I just feel empty inside, my brain thinks its good this way and justifies all the things that are happening. Constant intrusive thoughts in my head and I feel like Im on a bad drug trip. This isnt really important, I just feel like venting a little bit. I might just force myself back into an extremely overly happy mindset and just distract myself as much as possible. Basically what Im trying to ask how does one cope with being alone? How do you deal with feelings when you cant talk about any of it? Ive thought about taking some pills to help me calm down because its getting annoying.",

I got broke up with by someone I love so so deeply and felt so happy and safe with and ever since then Ive just descended into a deep depression and I dont know what to do. Im stuck at home, mostly in my bed cause I got injured. I cant feel happy anymore it seems. My antidepressants stopped doing anything and its just crippling sadness and pain and Ive started contemplating suicide and self harming again. Im not sure what to do anymore. I started smoking and it helped some, but not as much as I need it to. Ive tried so much and it just doesnt help. I just dont know what to do anymore.",
    "Please help, my girlfriend is depressed, I have no idea what to do. I tell her Ive been somewhat feeling the same and that Im here for her and I love her. I try to keep talking to her and I ask her to talk to me, but she kept getting more and more quieter, hesitant, then she starts apologizing, saying shes sorry for being a burden on me, saying that shes going to hurt me, saying theres nothing I can do to help her, and Im trying my best, I told her I love her so many times, I told her that Im here for her and I dont care if shes at her best or her worst, I told her that the next time I see her Im going to hold her tightly in my arms and then give her a passionate kiss, that Im going to buy her something nice and make her feel special, that Im going to live her no matter what state shes in, but she was still being really quiet and eventually just left me on read so I left her along. I kept trying to get her to talk to me, I wasnt trying to make her day something she didnt want to tell me, I just wanted to know that she was going to be ok before I fell asleep. Idk Im scared, a few weeks ago we were in a call, and she starts talking and venting to me about all the shit going on in her life, she starts crying really hard, then she admitted to breaking a mirror and cutting herself with it and that just fucking broke my heart. What do I do. I have no idea. I love this woman with every fiber of my being. I care for her and her wellbeing. When I see her like this, its like my heart loses a piece of its soul, if that even makes sense. Please, help. Is there anything I could possibly do. Edit ok, before I posted this, I got insanely depressed. I wanted to get high and numb myself like I usually do when I feel like this, but I only have a little bit of thc oil in my cart left and I was saving it for fun times with friends and with her, and I didnt want to waste it so instead of doing that, I decided to write a song.",

    "How does therapy start? Hello fellow redditors! I have been suffering from depression and suicidal thoughts since I was a teenager. I have often theorized if therapy could help but actually going there was always out of question for a variety of reasons. I have read what therapy is supposed to give you no cure, but a more endurable existence? but never how one goes about the whole thing. How do you choose a therapist? Do you just walk in and just start talking about all the bad things? I have never confided in anyone so it just seems more than obscure to just walk in and tell a stranger that I want to kill myself because there is no purpose to it all anyways...

I work a rotating roster and my body clock is everywhere, so I dont really have a routine which makes taking my meds at the correct time very difficult. Sometimes Ill have a fleeting moment that Ive forgotten to take them, but my brain quickly dismisses it as if its not important. I dont really know how to explain it. Deep down I know how important it is that I take them, but something stops me from caring. Thus starting the cycle of being chemically imbalanced and feeling unworthy of being mentally well. I essentially need to ingrain it into a routine somehow so I just dont think about it and just take them. Long story short, Im just seeking some tips with building a healthy routine so I can make this work.

Every time I try to think myself out of it I just fall back into thoughts of suicide again. Like the finishing thought behind all my thoughts is suicide and nothing else matters. I just feel like unless I kill myself Ill just be here waiting to kill myself until I finally do it. At this point Im not even sad anymore, Im just THAT tired of being alive. I have nothing to gain from continuing to live, Id rather just be at eternal peace after death over each day being wasted time after time after time again. I dont know what to do.

    "i had to say goodbye to my sweet boy today after finding out yesterday cancer is ravaging his body. maximus came home almost four years ago, after enduring years of abuse. he was a 90 pound hunk of love who thought he weighed about 5 pounds. most handsome boy youve ever seen, a pitbull with the biggest block head that i love more than anything. he always had to be by my side, and i always had to be by his. i would lay on the floor with him any chance i had, and he would always angle his head down and just collapse his body into my lap. my boy loved to get dressed up a bandana around his neck always made him sit up a little taller, and walk a little prouder. he got a rough start, having been used as a bait dog for the first half of his life. his body was permanently marked with scars from where evil scum had cut him repeatedly. when we found each other at the shelter, he had been there for 9 months and been adopted out and taken back quite a few times. ill never be able to wrap my mind around the fact no one else kept him, but im so thankful they didnt and that he waited for my family. he was missing almost all his teeth from chewing rocks, and was blind in his left eye. he has seen and experienced the worst humankind has to offer yet still had more love for us than you could ever imagine. he was my big, goofy, happy happy guy. the biggest regret i have is that i didnt get to him sooner than i did. Maximus didnt want to eat anything the past few days, and was more sluggish than usual. my mom took him to the vet yesterday just to make sure nothing was actually wrong, and they told us his red blood count was low and he needed a blood transfusion. it was serious but no reason he wont recover from it. we took him from there to emergency vet, where they ran tests and did scans. the vet said he has never seen anything like what was shown on those scans, that my sweet maximus was a very very sick little boy.",

    "I’m feeling very low energy and demotivated after about a month with Lexapro, spending most of the time in bed. I need help. I started taking Lexapro 5 weeks ago at 5mgday for situational or reactionary depression which isnt a major clinical depression according to my doctor. I had the initial side effects as predicted like sleepiness and vivid dreams, etc. which resolved in a couple of weeks as well as all the negative feelings and dark moods of loneliness etc. plus the anxiety and feeling overwhelmed which have mostly gone, however Ive been feeling extremely unmotivated and low that Im barely making it to work and the rest of the time Im in bed. My sleep was also quite bad feeling unrested in the mornings. Normally I drink one coffee and one tea a day but recently Ive been taking triple shot espressos and Im not feeling any difference. My sugar and carb consumption has also increased. Last Monday when I had my follow up with the doctor he decided to increase the dose to 10mgday. Ive been on 10mgday for almost a week now and probably my sleep quality has improved a little bit but still very very unmotivated and low. Im going through upsetting phases with my family which doesnt help and while I had managed to keep my life under control for a while, things have got out of hand again and my room is a total mess.

I always had period problems, I had a lot of problems and fatigue the last two years but the last six months the pain and fatigue have skyrocketed making me unable to work or study outside home. I am a Spanish migrant living in Belgium with my partner, struggling to learn flemish and to feel that I belong here. I cant rely on my parents abusive father  mum that wont defend me. I still habe a couple of friends but they are tired of hearing my complaints. ... I got depressed three years ago after a lot of bad luck with jobsstudies. With some therapy and antidepressants I finally got better. Last year i was feeling much better to the point where I improved a lot in my flemish skills and found a job gardening. Then my other diseases hitted hard and I needed to quit the job because I was to weak to do it. I went back to school to learn more flemish. I managed to pass a course despite all the pain and fatigue and missing a lot of clases. My teacher cant stand that I do well without going to all the clases and she told me that she wanted to fail me but as I had a 710 the secretary didnt allowed it. The next course she had a easy solution. She refused to let me do the last exams. As technically I failed the course not doing the last exams she could finally fail me. The secretary didnt help me at all. Now I sit at home in daily pain seeing how all my hopes for the future are going down the drain. ...

    "Death Anxiety Hey all. Sorry if this seems unhinged. Im just gonna try to get it all out. In the last month and a half, Ive been having unwanted deep philosophical thoughts on how we perceive time, what the self is, and that we all die eventually. Ive been diagnosed with depression since I was 16 when I first had these thoughts hit me in a big way and Im 27 now. Zoloft has always helped, but Ive been bad about my meds for the last year or so so Im having a relapse, I get this. But the thing is, the stuff Im worrying about feels so real. These arent Im bad, or no one loves me, or I want to hurt other people thoughts. Theyre on a deeper, simpler level. Sometimes I wonder if Im being treated for depression when Im actually just seeing the truths of existence clearer than a lot of other people else and that makes me feel hopeless that Ill ever feel better. Like the system might not be equipped to help me. It makes me so sad. The problem with my worries is that theyre real worries. Im mainly concerned with why do anything at all if were just animals who die. I AM going to die. There probably ISNT a soul. I WILL eventually cease to exist. All the stuff I care about is just electricity and matter and chrmicals in the brain telling me I care about stuff. The I isnt even necessarily real, its just a collection of smaller parts. I know that the classic reddit atheist way of getting through this stuff is just saying life is what you make of it, but when really confronted by the seeming truth that the self will disappear when we die, I guess it just rings kind of hollow. Like, yes of course I love my girlfriend and our pets and my parents and my friends, and I love to make art and perform, I want to go to grad school and get married and have kids. And doing that stuff makes me feel great! But lately Ive just been under this cloud of none of this has purpose even if you pretend it does. Like, Ill feel great doing these things and then Ill think that was nice, but Im going to forget that it happened and cease to exist eventually.",

    "r/Suicidewatch didn't really give me what I needed, so I'm sharing my feelings on this subreddit My depression has gotten so worse, and I just want to end it all. I cant imagine a future for myself anymore. I had everything going for me before I had depression, but now, I have nothing. I have no friends, and even when I did have friends, all of my conversations were one sided with all of them, and I felt so alone when I was friends with them. My dad is my only parent. My dad isnt there for me when Im at my worst, and hes only there for me when I have a high GPA or get all As. I had to convince him for three years that I had an issue when I had a possible anxiety disorder. Recently, I havent had the best grades due to my worsening depression, and when my dad confronted me about it, I told him that I didnt have the energy to do the work, because I may have depression, and he took my phone away because I didnt tell him the whole story essentially invalidating my feelings. Ive told him two months ago that I thought about suicide, and he ignored me. On my birthday, I attempted suicide, but stopped at the third pill, and tried to tell my dad, and he said Im doing this all because he took my phone away along with other stuff and yelled at me, essentially he implied that I was doing it for attention. He doesnt care about me when Im at my worst. My dad always says, Youve changed since middle school, and in middle school you werent like this whenever I tell him. Nobody really cares about you until youre gone. Hell never understand. Even the fucking school staff has made my life worse by scolding me for my F in the class in front of all the students, and everyone nearby which was a lot of people heard since most of them glanced at me. Even a month later, a girl who was really far away from where me and the counselor were heard and asked about it, and whether I was staying in that class. My English teacher had noticed that Im no longer turning in assignments and scolded me in front of the class by saying, Whats wrong with you?!",
    "Prescribed lamictal for depression? Hi everyone. Apologies for how long this may be. Has anyone been prescribed lamictal for depression WITHOUT having bipolar disorder, along with suffering from low testosterone? A bit of bs  my SO was prescribed lamictal to combat his depression which is also very likely triggered by low T, which we are in the process of trying to treat, and tapered up from 25 mg to 100 mg within a month beginning in June. Prior to starting it, his previous most recent depressive episode was back in December. After he tapered up to 100, within a week, he immediately had a major severe depressive episode and never came out of it. Rather than his normal highs, high level mediums, and mid levels, he bordered on depression the entire time. He began to withdraw completely throughout the entire month of July, and then hit a second major depressive episode that lasted about 2 weeks. Throughout this entire time, he began saying he no longer wanted to be here, doesnt have feelings for me anymore, etc. I urged him to stop taking the lamictal, and although he has reached out to his psych multiple times over the past few weeks, he has yet to hear back so he decided to stop on his own. Since stopping the meds a week ago, Ive seen flashes of the man he used to be coming back  but unfortunately, the medication numbed him to the point where he simply just doesnt want to be here anymore. Were not exactly sure what to expect from this point on  he keeps hoping that the longer hes off, that hell come back to what he was feeling emotionally but at this point we just dont know. Were still awaiting the results from other testing, but for now, were just circling the drain and its legitimately killing me.",

I discussed this with a therapist and she seemed to indicate it was situational i was coming out of college into the great unknown of adulthood and was completing a year internship on 500 a month. I became an official adult with a night job. The night job did not help the depression. I had insurance now told my primary care doctor that i was depressed she recommended yoga. I lost 2 dear people to suicide within 4 mouths of each other. The grief was intense  its been 10 years. After perhaps 3 years, i started feeling better. Honestly, i felt ok for the past 7 years.

I was one of those gifted kids that never studied which started biting me in the butt once I got to IB high school. Got burnt out before I even got to college. Had issues with depression in high school as well. Fast forward to today and this semester isnt even half way over and Im pretty sure Im going to fail 46 of my classes, I have no motivation to do anything nor can I make myself care about not failing exams. I would hate the professors but I just feel too exhausted to give a crap about them. Half the time I dont show up to classes, even the ones I liked at the beginning of the semester, and when I do show up Im sitting staring at a wall or rewatching a dumb video on reddit or instagram or whatever. Ive regularly had suicidal thoughts since high school about jumping off a parking garage or crashing my car but I know Ill never do it because of my family and my pet and responsibilities or whatever. I know I need to work at it and all but I cant seem to find the light at the end of the tunnel. I can feel anxious about failing a class but I cant bring myself to really care about it. My best friend says Im just burnt out and my therapist is considering medication. I just dont know what to do or how to get past just pushing through and get to living for myself. Not sure if this all made sense. TLDR lack of motivation doesnt even come close to describing how I feel about life.

Ive seen that these can be symptoms of major depression but I dont know how could that be, since I feel pretty good the rest of the day. Maybe some days are worse than others but idk. It hurts a lot. Every morning Im scared of waking up since I know that anything will make me feel depressed. Oh you have online classes? How about thinking that you should drop out because you have zero motivation to do any schoolwork? Youre watching a reality show? How about thinking that you are worthless and that you will never find a girlfriend since youre stuck in your house all day?

    "Trying to have energy Im on two different meds for my clinical depression but I still only have a small amount of energy that I have to use up at work making sure I am as normal appearing as possible, so when I get home I have no energy left to cook or clean or do anyting really except maybe minimum requiring things. Like emptying cat litter, putting more food in the fur babies dishes, making sure they have water, grab something to eat like Dry Cereal or a PopTart or something like that you dont have to do anything to and setting my alarm for work the next day and making sure I have underwear and everything for work the next day.

I have sleep apnea and a CPAP that I wear every night but Id still dont get the best sleep. I have some mobility issues due to injury from the Army and also being overweight. Im working on trying to lose weight as well but one limitation to losing weight is finding, even at work, needing the snack to keep myself alert.

I have stopped looking for a cure, I know it doesnt exist. But I need new ways to cope with my depression because my old coping techniques are no longer working. I have tried meditation too but seems like it does nothing for me. The only ways I could cope with my depression were doing something creative like painting or drawing and listening to music. I no longer enjoy creating things and listening to music and Ive been left without hope because every day I keep getting worse and theres no way for me to cope with my depression anymore. So heres the question, what do you guys do when you feel like doing nothing besides sleeping? I am literally not in the mood for doing anything and its tearing me apart because Ive spent the last few months of my life just being a leech and a parasite and doing nothing and its taking a toll on my mental health thats already damaged badly enough. I need help. Forcing myself to do these things doesnt help either.",

My aunt also told me that her kidney function is low in her remaining kidney she had the other removed because of cancer and thats not great news.

    "How do I tell my friends and family that I am depressed? I am 21 years old, Ive been dealing with depression ever since high school but never discussed it with anyone until this year. Last semester I visited my schools counseling center because I just felt so shitty. My depression comes in waves, so it comes and goes which is partly the way Ive been able to hide it for so long but when Its bad I spend hours just convincing myself to shower or brush my teeth. I feel so unmotivated and unhappy. I finally saw a counselor and explained everything I have been feeling and she suggested that I see a psychiatrist. I really want to because I dont know if I can get through another episode and I feel one coming on soon, but I dont know how to tell my mom that I need to see one. I am still on my parents insurance plan so they will find out regardless. I just dont know how to tell my parents or my friends. I dont want to come off as lazy or sad and I definitely dont want them to treat me differently.",

    "Should I kill myself? I am the most uninteresting person and I feel like I am the only one who puts effort into any of my relationships. I guess Ill tell you a bit about myself, since this really is a chance for me to rant. I know the question sounds edgy, or attention seeking but I just cant get this thought out of my head. Okay so I had a shitty childhood as lots of people had, mother was Schizophrenic, father was controlling and abusive. It created a lot of stress for me as, I never got a chance to build friendships as a child. I was too scared to bring people home and have them see what my family was like. Also I was usually way poorer than the others in my area, so I would constantly be judged for what I had or how Id dress. Though thats not whats causing me stress now, Ive somewhat moved past that phase. My family became somewhat middle class, I live with my stepmom and dad in a new city when I was 13. He isnt as bad anymore, but I hate living in this city. As soon as I came here, I got bullied and pushed around. Had to deal with being jumped and just insecurity. Shortly before moving I started to find my group, and I had friends that I had a lot of fun with, even though most of the time was spent at their place, but after moving I couldnt find anyone I vibed with. No one I can connect, everyone thought I was weird and out of place. So I just focused on myself  I want to be a computer scientist someday do just focus on that. Though there was always this sense of loneliness. I am socially anxious, awkward, and have trouble meeting new people, but honestly on the inside, I am an extrovert. I constantly crave social interaction, I want go spend most of my time with other people, like the only time I need alone time is to practice piano. But even then its more fun with others around. This loneliness just slowly made me sadder and sadder. I slowly got more and more awkward and struggled more and more to reach out.",
    "I have a really hard time getting myself to do basic things like make food for myself or apply for jobs how do I overcome this? Ive struggled with this kind of depression on and off for a couple years I know that Im not just a lazy person because I have been able to work very very hard at things in the past but I have been unemployed since halloween and I am having real trouble doing even the basics. I am living with my parents at the moment and they have been beyond amazing to me and I really really want to just get a job and stop being a burden on them but for some reason I really have trouble getting myself to stop procrastinating and Ive only applied to like 10 jobs since I quit my last job a month ago It was a horrible job so I do not regret quiting. I rarely make food for myself which causes me to lose weight and I was already underweight before I became unemployed. I feel so ashamed of myself, every time I start to do something productive I start to worry Im going to do it wrong and so I stop doing it then I feel worse and go procrastinate on reddit so I feel better for .02 seconds then I feel worse for procrastinating.

    "I’m lonely and depressed Then we were sent home. My friend and I who happened to be on two flights took some edibles before. We had to leave at 330, so we didnt bother sleeping before we went to the airport. These edibles hit HARD. Once I got to the gate wed be waiting at, I was paranoid. There was people around. These people might have COVID19. The seat Im sitting on might have COVID19. I cant escape it. It is everywhere. Whenever I heard someone cough, it felt like an impending bioweapon. But I was trapped in this airport and couldnt avoid it. I had a minipanic attack in the washroom. I got on the flight, and it was surreal. I hasnt really processed things yet. But I started to drift off to sleep, and saw myself at the house we were staying, with everyone in my volunteer group around. Then I woke up. And the whole world came rushing into me. I was on a flight. I was leaving. I was going home. I might not see some of those people ever again. My volunteer program experience was now in the past, and I couldnt change that. I wanted to cry. Its not like I even really LIKED everyone in my group. But after spending almost three months living with them, I was still attached to them. And it was hard to leave that behind. After a blurry 14 hours, I finally got to my home airport. My parents met me there and picked me up. I told them how things went, but its impossible to really communicate my experience. I got home, but realized I wasnt really home. Things were different. Society has morphed into a nightmarelike dystopia. Im not even allowed to see all my friends. How has the world changed so quickly? I was able to go out and see two of my friends. We played basketball, and it was pretty fun. I told them about how my trip was, and shared a few stories. But it was weird.",

    "I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts for as long as I can remember and it's only getting harder to reason against harming myself. I never had a catalyst or anything for my depression or suicidal ideations. Its just been present for a very long time. Ive gone through prescribed regimens of medication, seen counselors, stayed active and healthy, made friends very easily, and just overall tried to keep myself out there and try or experience new things to see if I could find that calling in life for myself over my life. Things have generally gone very well for me in life other than the numerous times I let my suicidal thoughts get the best of me and I either let shit fall apart or an attempt on my own life puts me down a notch. This has been something thats just always been present and feels very dominating as a part of who I am. It used to scare me and I used to want to feel better than this, but I just feel completely indifferent and empty to it and everything else in life now. I dont have the energy to pretend Im a normal person or talk to people, I dont experience any emotions, all of my old hobbies and such feel like a chore, and I cant envision wanting anything in the future. This depersonalization side of my suicidal ideations has been going on for a couple years now and more than ever I just cant find any reason or desire to stay alive. Ive been miserable for as long as I can remember and I know its not right, but, at this point I dont know any other mindset other then feeling this way. I know how to be a decent human being, I do good at work and such, Ive developed very close relationships in platonic and romantic senses before, but nothing makes it feel worth the effort at all. Im at my wits end and I got rope today and Im so afraid of how much itll hurt but I want this to be over with so bad and I just dont know what to do.",
    "How do you deal with losing all interest in your passions in life? A few years ago, a really bad breakup turned into a long term depressive episode, and I lost all interest in the very few passions in life that define me. I spend a lot of time really missing being in love with what I used to do the way I previously was from time to time I even have the tendency to try to push myself into giving it another spin. But every time I try, it feels like a job, and all motivation and determination I have gets sucked straight out of me. I just want to love doing music again, because Ive been such a bland, shell of a person since I suddenly fell out of it.

I dont know if it can help, but i have had a difficoult childood and i think i have some trauma left i recently discovered the meaning of a people pleaser and how it perfectly describes me. I started isolating myself from all my friends, i quitted from all socials, i started losing interests in everything and i dont even know what im doing with my life.

Ive been all my life thinking I had a great future ahead as I was a betterthanaverage student, my parents let me choose the career I wanted even if it was an economic riskIm majoring in arts, went through college very competently, got good grades but I also was inadvertently sabotaging myself. Ive been suffering from depression and anxiety since I was a teenager, my parents were told I might have a mental disorder such as an anxiety disorder or BPD. I went to a psychiatrist for a whole year but dropped out since I wasnt feeling any different and decided to instead focus on school. But being honest I never truly made an effort in school. Many professors told me I was talented but I was always so afraid to prove them wrong so I did no major projects. I kept avoiding major job opportunities since I thought those werent for me and I wasnt the right guy for them. My professional life had a shine of light at the beginning of 2020 as one of my projects was being financed, then the pandemic hit putting everything on hiatus, got no job of course, and had to go back to my parents. One year later everythings worse. Still jobless, still with my parents, procrastinating, hitting bottom every couple months, with 3 suicide attempts already, and just shitty thoughts every passing hour. My parents are sick of me even if they dont say it out loud. Im sick of myself. Im a fucking parasite too scared to do anything to change that. To move back to my apartment and find a job. To see how accomplished my friends are and seeing what theyve done in the past year and me thinking good for you mate, I just tried killing myself more than once haha. Im too ashamed. Im too old now. I see people being successful at 24 and Im 29 now and its too fucking late, still living off my parents is so humiliating. I cant shake away that feeling and Im so afraid one of these days that feeling turns unbearable and just end me without thinking it twice. Im done.",

    "My best friend's depression is triggering mine. What do I do? Ive been depressed for years and hated all the thoughts of suicide that were stuck in my head. A month ago I finally opened up to my parents, things have brightened up, I seeked professional help last week, and might have some counseling with my fam soon. Ive reconnected with people Ive missed, and Im really trying my hardest to stop feeling depressed. Ive even started reading up on meditation and such. My doc and I are still thinking about the meds though. But my bestfriend...is suicidal and depressed, Ill call them John for now. He regularly has the urge to selfharm, skip meals, or do reckless things. And regularly talks about wanting to die and how he wants to do it. Ive given him a lot of advice and Ive done my best to remind him that Im always here. But....its starting to feel like he never takes any advice I give and that hes given up on himself already. He already seeked help long before I ever did but he hates his meds cuz he thinks it just forces him to be happy. Hes an online friend so I cant approach him face to face. Ive known him for so long and I know thats hes a good person and that he doesnt deserve this. He wants a better life where hes free from his family...so I recommended some small job offerings to keep him stable but he doesnt want to commit to it. I recommended he find some hobbies...but he doesnt want to. I told him to try making new friends, he says he already has me... I tried to explain why that wouldnt be healthy and he seemed to try to say that other people will just hurt him...but Im not perfect... I cant provide for all of his emotional needs...

    "Was it just a phase or is it depression? I have depression and schizophrenia I also have dreams of being a successful music artist. Id like to be a singersongwriter, musician, and producer. Id like to play multiple instruments such as guitar, piano and bass. But I dont know how to achieve this goal. Being depressed I dont feel like doing anything And making music is no longer pleasurable to me. I read somewhere you must practice 1.5 to 2 hours a day on one instrument to see results. I cant do that... I can barely play guitar or piano for 15 mins. I also gave up on the bass guitar. Before Id just play for hours and write songs No matter if it was utter shit. I was dedicated. My goal seems impossible but then I look at multitalented artists such as Prince, FKJ, Mac Demarco, or Kevin Parker. So it lets me know its possible just very hard for me to accomplish. Maybe I should stop trying to be like them and be who I am meant to be...but damnit... I bought all these instruments I started making music when I was 13. Im 27 now. I spent many years believing I would have a career in music and never had a breakthrough. Now, since I have depression and all my musical instruments and gear appear to be useless junk, I wish I had fell in love, gotten married and had children. Even learn to drive and get a well paying job. I had bad anxiety growing up so it prevented me from certain aspects of life. Music gave me strength and purpose. Now Im just lost in life and not sure if things will get better. Im currently on disability for my schizophrenia I was diagnosed around 23 and am currently looking for a part time job. Im a late bloomer in life. I even still live with my mother. Shes been my caretaker. So now Im learning to live without music. Its very hard. I dont know who I am anymore.

Ive known this guy since we were in middle school, we started talking during high school, and after a failed attempt at my life I dropped out of college moved back home and we ended up dating. This guy had been my rock for all those years. He experienced with me the pain of having my dad get a stroke, my only uncle on my dads side pass away, being diagnosed with ovarian cancer, having my dads mom pass away, my dad have a second stroke, and finding out my mom had breast cancer and going through chemo. Things werent always perfect. I nagged a lot on things he did because he tend to me reckless and not have a plan. Overall I just wanted things to be better for him. To be prepared and essentially have a backup plan. This year he started going through a rough phase at work, being in a call center and having upset customers he would take it to heart when they would tell him to kill himself. For a very long time I told him to find someone to talk to, to go look for a counselor. He never did and I saw him get worse and worse. I tried being the best support I could for him. It was only fair and obviously I did it because I loved him. On the November 7th he finally spoke to a counselor. I asked how it went and he said it went well. Then on November 9th he asked to speak to me once I arrived home from being out of town. He arrived at my house after work. He begins explaining to me that when he was talking to his counselor he was asked what made him happy and responded with photography. He mentioned that he never thought of us. Which is fair because it had been rocky. He said he didnt love me anymore. He finished what he said and waited for me to reply. I was in shock. I didnt realize just how bad it was. It was like a curve ball was thrown at me. I didnt know because he never opened up to me even when I asked.",
    "Boyfriend broke up with me a week after I got a shocking diagnosis, says my mood was too bad lately hi, frankly Im here to hear some motivational words. Ive been suffering from depression since I was a child, this was diagnosed by a psychiatrist. Ive been feeling better for a while. However, after I got with my boyfriend it definitely got better. Now last week I got the shocking diagnosis, that I might not be able to get pregnant naturally because of an undetected infection that I had at some point and Im going to surgery in a month due to chronic pain as consequence of this infection. Ive been really depressed, angry and frustrated lately. I just think that this could have been detected sooner, as Ive had pain in my lower abdomen for a while. On top of this, Im really stressed from university because I have to do a lot of homework and also work. My boyfriend of 2 12 months just broke up with me because he said that Ive been in a bad mood and he feels affected by this. I cant believe that he would just leave me at a time like this. Hes shown 0 empathy for my situation and always said I should stop feeling grumpy. I mean honestly. I moved out of my student housing room during the weekend to go live at my dads place during this difficult time and discovered that there is mold in my room now. I just feel like I cant catch a break and wonder how I can deal with this. Im so shocked because he always told me he loves me more than I him and that he really adores me. And now this. I mean its good that I know this now after such a short time rather than later. No one can use a partner that wont be there for them during difficult times. Im just having a hard time grasping this situation. I feel even worse now that he told me his reason for breaking up was that my mood had been too bad lately. I am afraid that I will be back to my major depression due to the course of these events. Im probably gonna phone some therapists soon so that I can deal with this situation better, as I fear that I might selfharm.",

Yes I know, Im stupid, but I was going to forgive him. He was telling me that anything I wanted him to do to gain my trust back, to let him know. I told him to block her in all social medias. He did. He sent me screenshots of everything. The long call happened from a Friday night through a Saturday morning. His regret and attempt to try gaining my trust back only lasted until Sunday. These two days he spent apologizing and telling me how he wanted to grow old with me, that kind of stuff. Well, like all this didnt seem bad enough, the worst part of the story comes now. On Monday morning, I was at the gym, and I got a message from him. The way he wrote seemed odd, so I asked if something was wrong and he said he didnt feel good. I immediately left the gym and told him to give me a few minutes, that I would get home and we could call. As soon as I got home, I didnt even shower or anything, I just went to my room and called him. Then he just finished shattering my heart. He said he needed to be honest with me. He said that from the very first time we met in person, when I went there, he felt something wasnt right between us. That he didnt feel a connection. He said kissing and other intimate moments felt weird. He said he only proceeded with everything, asked me to marry him, started my Visa process and everything because he was scared of being alone. Since he never had another relationship before and I was the first one that ever got interested in him, he felt like he had to do everything he could to keep me in his life, so he wouldnt end up alone. Now that he had found this other girl, he felt he really connected with someone.",
    "Does it ever really get any better? Ive been dealing with depression for a long time, several years. I only recently started trying to fix it and started taking some meds which Ive been on for about 3.5 months now. Whats the point of it all? I come home from work now and for no reason just feel totally useless and like I dont matter. At least before the meds I was numb and didnt feel this way. Im finding myself almost in tears at work, for no reason at all. Earlier this week I came home, sat down on my couch and just started to cry. All week Ive had 0 motivation to do anything. I still ended up going to the gym for a couple yoga classes hoping it would at least make me feel a bit better, it didnt. I just want to know if this will ever get better? Will I ever feel usefulwanted? Will I ever genuinely be happy? Im so tired of being tired and sad.",
    "I have no idea how to improve my life Hi, so Im very embarassed to be writing this and fair warning this might get long, but here it goes Im a woman in my late twenties and I basically feel like Ive wasted my life. I used to have many ailments growing up, which has led to me being coddled and protected by my mom. I feel like I got stuck somewhere in my development and it really hurts to see people mych younger being much more mature and successful than me. Ive tried studying different things, but I feel like none of them were ever really my thing. Id like to be an artist, but my shitty selfesteem is really preventing me from sharing anything with the world. I want to find lovewhich is actually my most important goal at the moment, but I have no clue how to find someone, especially with my depression and anxiety. I feel unloveable. Tinder seems like its just designed to make you doubt yourselfIm not a looker. So yeah, I just dont know. The worst part is I know its my fault, but I feel like Im helpless and have zero control over anything. I dont feel like my therapist understands my needs either. I need serious help, because I feel very hopeless.",
    "Should I tell my strict parents I self-harm? Im currently 17 and still living with my parents and I dont know if its the smartest move to tell my parents about my selfharm.

Hi everyone, Im 27 years old and I had a brain tumor recently, the doctors removed but it left a big scar on my face, whenever I cut my hair is pretty visible and everybodys asks about it, I really dont wanna say to people Ive had cancer just a little too personal I guess, and theres the fact Im already ugly af and a dj I kinda work with my image too, I went to teraphy and the psychologist said I should see the scar as a winning scar cause Ive beated cancer, now I worry about never having a girlfriend anymore cause thats not really attractive neither I am, so, Id really appreciate some help!",

She used to tell me that I complete her and that I make her the happiest girl on the planet... She told me she wants to marry me, she wants to be with forever... I bought her a ring and wanted to surprise her but the next thing I know was that she cheated on me... Everything reminds me of her, I cant do something without crying, without imagining they say I love you to each other... I feel like the whole world is collapsing on me and that this is the end of the line for me, what have I done to deserve this, she told me I treat her like a princess, I went way out of my way to make her happy, I did everything I could do but this is what she did to me.

    "Depression is getting a lot worse So a bit of background, Ive struggled with mental health since a very young age. Ive been in therapy several times, and have been on antidepressants and antianxiety meds for 3 years. Ive always thought my depression was situational, and Ive worked really hard to change my life for the better. The past 612 months have been the best Ive ever felt, as such I made the decision to start trying to come off my antidepressants. My GP advised to take the pill on alternative nights which Ive been doing for the past few weeks. However this past week my depression has came back a lot worse, and Im really struggling with urges to hurt myself. I guess Im looking for advice if anyone else has experienced this when trying to come off meds? Thanks for any advice offered, Ill really appreciate it.",
    "26. Depressed, socially anxious, lost and suicidal. I spent most of the money I made with my dad on weed. This is how life was for about 8 years. Around 2013 i began taking lexapro and took it until Feb 2019 but it didnt really help. My oldest brother ended up overdosing form heroin 4 years after I graduated high school. I had a moment where i said to myself enough is enough, stop smoking, get your shit together and do something with your life but that was short lived. A year after that we moved to Florida. This move didnt really fuck me up as much as the first one but it did affect me a little as I do not like change in general. My drinking increased since I moved down here and I smoked just as much. Fast forward to November 2019. I turned 26 and holy shit it hit me like a ton of bricks. I had a huge quarter life crisis and realized that the past decade of my life flew by so fast and I spent it doing absolutely nothing. I stopped smoking and stopped drinking after doing both habitually for at least a decade. I told myself I could not live like that anymore and if I didnt make a change sooner of later I would look back a decade from now and have the same regrets. I began considering joining the service but honestly had no clue what I wanted to do for a career and I still dont. I just felt like doing anything has to be better than doing nothing and it might help me out of my socially anxious depressed bubble that I am in. Unfortunately around mid November I began suffering from severe dry eye which i am still dealing with as i type this. It has cost me an insane amount of money in doctors visits and i still havent gotten better. I had lasik 4 years ago and it might be the cause dont get lasik. This only has made me more depressed and suicidal. I also went to a cheap therapist for about a month during this time. I also went to a psychiatrist and took Zoloft for about a month and a half without any improvement and stopped because of fear that it would make my dry eye worse. One of the only positive things that has happened recently is I began talking to a girl i met on a dating site.",
    "Why can’t I open up to anyone about the things that unsettle me? I am hoping that someone here can help me with this. I have been sexually assaultedI think that thats the proper term without get into detail by my classmates when I was in sixth grade. I have been so ashamed that I didnt tell anyone about this to this day. And I am still not able to work up enough courage to tell anyone my story. I have been writing with this lady from my countries crisis hotline for about two week and I have told her already some things about myself, but they are all rather superficial. I cant see myself opening up to anyone beyond that very small surface level. When I imagine getting a therapist and talking to them I think that I could tell them maybe a little bit more if they were facing me with their back. Its all just so weird. It probably makes no sense to you, I dont understand it either... Someone I wish that I could talk about everything but there is just a barrier in my head making it hard to even type about stuff. I am probably going to lose my mind one day without having anyone know why.",

    "Advice on handling negative thoughts and depression Hi everyone, Im looking for sources of informationbooks to readvideos to watch to help me overcome my depression. Ive had a lot of negative thoughts in my head for a very long time. Usually involving self hatred and a strong feeling that Im unworthy of care, love and affection. Its definitely hurt my relations with those around me and has affected my moods and ability to function. More recently, Ive experienced severe depression from the end of last year, that culminated in me attempting to end it all in early February. I really want to try and get better but I keep finding myself slipping and the huge amount of self loathing comes back in a massive wave. I dont really have any close friends to talk about this with, although at the university Im really fortunate to have access to an affordable psychologist who I can see once in a while. Id like to try different techniques to help me progress and get healthy and any advice on how to do this or what to read would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading",

    "Staying POSITIVE is ALREADY hard and now I am the caregiver to a SUICIDAL FRIEND I was pretty much unsure what to do so I wrote a letter to the family secretly I know where she stays and i made sure to text her mum that I had put a letter outside their house gate. They eventually texted back to express their gratitude but I did not hear from them afterwards... So again, she had her bouts of episode and meltdowns and I had to calm her down every single time. it gets exhausting for me as well. And I always feel that I am trying to fight against absorbing and feeling down from all of these. Recently, she went for a staycay and her mum called me. She was begging me to ask my friend to cancel it to which i have no influence on at all since my friend was really optimistic about this she initially had plans to kill herself during this trip but after meeting another psychologist, she kind of is delayin it. When her mum called me a second time, i was with my friend and my friend was really on the edge. She tried taking my phone away from me to talk to her mother but I stopped her. Her mum SAID thru the phone since i didnt know she is with you and you are still going to allow her to go for the staycay, ALL is on you. YOU SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY IF SMTG HAPPENS TO HER. I DONT CARE but you make sure she is safe. I was quite upset by this but politely ended the call as my friend tried grabbing the phone away from me. Ended up, she called her mum back only to shout and scream at her mum  berating the mum for calling me. Her mum was upset. The mum texted me and blamed me for my friends action. I replied to her saying I was sorry that that happened and that I tried calming my friend but she went hysteria instead. The mum later replied telling me that since my friend does not listen to her as a mother, i should be the one doing the advice and guiding my friend to the so called right path. She said that she leave me to take care of my friend for her. Im speechless guys.. I am so exhausted already but yet this happened??",

    "She Said I Can't Have What I Want Ive been suffering from depression for a very quite a while, but it has gotten worse during this pandemic. Ive spent so much time alone, and my LTR ended as well. I started with a new therapist about a month ago, because the one I had, though I liked her, kept rescheduling on me with very little notice. I felt like she didnt find our sessions as much of a priority as other clients, because she told me that the person before me ran over time and there was no time for me. Anyway, my therapist met with me today, and I have had a hard time connecting with her. First, she did not believe that I was raised by narcissistic parents. She felt it was my behaviors that were causing them to behave towards me the way they did and still do. Ive found I cant bring up family issues with her. Today, I was feeling extremely depressed because Ive been so danged lonely. I can go days without saying a single, solitary word to a human being. I crave human contact. I told her I was feeling worthless, useless, and unloved. I told her I was questioning why I was even here on this Earth since it didnt seem to matter one way or another. She asked me what I wanted in this life. I said I wanted to be loved and accepted by others at least one special someone. She told me that was the wrong thing to ask for. I was being childish. She said people are unreliable and will let you down. I cant make them love me or accept me. So I needed to think of something else. This just increased my depression further. I cant expect to be loved? I shouldnt want to be accepted by others? Can anyone explain this to me? From all that I have learned, Love is a basic human need. Love is essential to life. Please help me...",

I cant afford to get her the treatment she needs and I certainly dont consider getting any for myself because I feel like I can still function on the bare minimum.

    "I need help communicating with my depressed wife. I love my wife. I really do. It breaks my heart that our ability to communicate has broken down entirely. Everything I say runs through a negativity filter and gets interpreted as personal attack. Seriously. Ive been told Im too logical. Which might have some situtational truth to it. Not all conversations call for logic, and I probably do apply these processes to more wishywashy, emotional conversations than I should. But Im working on not always trying to be Mr. Fixit. That I overthink and analyze things that dont need to be analyzed. Which I think I know what shes getting at, but Im unaware of any problem that was solved by not analyzing possible solutions. I know not every complaint is a request for a fix. But when its a constant refrain of complaint for weeks or months, maybe its time I tried to help alleviate? And that I talk too much and dont listen. So I make active efforts to listen and say nothing. Even when painful and untrue accusations are flung at me. Like supposed infidelity or that I dont love her anymore because her depression has caused her to gain a few pounds by over indulging on icecream. Even when I feel like I should tell her those ideas and accusations are not only unhelpful, but deeply untrue, and hurtful to me, I just take them on the chin, because when I have attempted to reassure her of their falseness, in the past, that I still love her, thats taken as needless contradiction and proof that I dont listen. In response to these accusations, Ill respond something like, Okay, Ill just listen then. How does that make you feel? And I get the angry response of, See!? Just like that! Youve always got an answer for everything! I have to be missing some piece. How can I promise to only listen, and ask a question, and by the time it gets to her ears, it has mutated into an antagonistic criticism or correction. I feel like Im totally locked into a Twilight Zone episode. How do I communicate with someone that will reject the behavior they just asked for?",

    "Questions about taking Wellbutrin XL 150 mg, about 72 hours before I start In 48 to 72 hours, I will begin taking Wellbutrin XL 150 mg once a day, which will be my first time taking a pharmaceutical medicine for anxiety and depression, after my twelvestep program sponsor encouraged me to do so, and after my mother  a psychiatric nurse encouraged me to do so. I have a robust support system, and for over seven years, I have regularly engaged in a myriad of modalities to address anxiety, depression, and hopelessness, and a pattern of burnout, including but not limited to cognitive behavioral therapy, two twelvestep programs, different forms of meditation, various mindfulness practices, hatha yoga, bhakti yoga, weightlifting, highintensity interval training, longdistance running, reading books on personal development and introspection, different forms of journaling, a myriad of support groups, numerous supplements, psychedelics, etc. As one of my hatha yoga instructors has stated, I do all the things. I have chosen to take Wellbutrin XL 150 mg for many reasons. It seems to have minimal side effects in most people based on my research and conversations with my psychiatrist and other doctors, it does not lead to some of the side effects that I am most concerned about, like weight gain, and it seems to be a manageable introduction to psychiatric medicine. Moreover, all of the previouslymentioned modalities have changed my life for the better since 2014. Still, a destructive and potentially lifethreatening pattern comes up in my life, time and time again, and my psychiatrist, my mother, and others believe that Wellbutrin XL 150 mg may help.",

    "My breakup is killing me Sorry about the melodramatic title, but this really is what it feels like. Ill try to keep this story short, however I could keep on talking for hours and if someone one this sub was willing to have a talk with me by PMs Id love to because Im just so incredibly lonely right now. About a week ago my girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me. It was a stupid breakup and I feel like my behaviour is the reason for why we broke up, even though she too made plenty of mistakes. When I lost her I once again realized how much she meant to me and that I didnt want to lose her at any costs so I tried to get her back. But all I got were meanspirited messages saying how she doesnt miss me, shes realized were incompatible and that shes glad I moved out. Some days ago I created a tinder profile because I thought itd help me get over her. Guess what, first evening on tinder I saw her profile. And it fucking killed me inside. The next days, she would routinely put some nice clothes on and leave, while I was stuck in the living room watching her leave to some tinder gate, and it killed me. Thats when I realized I had to leave.. so while she was at work I packed up all my stuff and left, leaving her one last voice message that I cant take the situation and that I still want her back. Thats when I got her meanspirited message. I feel like she was all I had. People I talk to are telling me to distract myself with things that are fun to me, but frankly, I dont know whats fun to me anymore. Watching tv shows? Gaming? Playing the guitar? I feel like watching shows and gaming are just occupational therapy to me. I used to love playing the guitar, at least I think so, but nowadays I feel so fucking bad whenever I play that its hard to call it fun either. Sports? Ive gained some weight so I decided I wanted to lose 10kg. That was a week ago, the same day she broke up with me in fact, its kind of the reason why we got into the fight responsible for our breakup.",

Its hard for me to hold down a consistent job, still be creative and productive, and not want to yeet myself every day. I just dont get it...maybe I hit the Unlucky Lottery? Theres a part of me that just gets sadder when I see posts from my friends showing off their engagement rings or the places theyve traveled. Im not supposed to feel that way so I try to ignore it, but the emotion becomes so overwhelming that I can no longer ignore it. Im supposed to be happy for them. I should stop wallowing in pity. An unspoken pitfall of depression is that you can become quite selfabsorbed. Id love to be in a relationship, but not many people want to date the mentally ill guywhich I guess is reasonable. Another shitty thing is that my religion teaches youre not even allowed to think about sex before marriage, which makes my life so much harder now that I associate every urge I have with guilt.

    "My depression has been so bad, no one has tried to contact me for months to check up and it tears me apart I have never been on reddit before but Im at my whits end on trying to find some sort of engagement with people online due to months of isolation and severe depression, because I feel I cant contain anymore of my sadness and loneliness. I have tried free online depression chat rooms and such but, really, I just need someone to tell me I matter. I dont know how this tends to work on Reddit but this is probably just going to be me venting. This year my depression has been so bad that my pessimism and slow bitterness and resentment with the world and everyone around me has scared me. Im scared of how much I have internally changed as a person, my lack of empathy and willingness to care about others, and that has never been my character. This has never been shown through my actions, but I can feel this pessimism and bitterness poisining me internally. I have lost faith in everything, and because of that I eventually stopped coming online on social media altogether for months, both to deal with myself but also because I didnt want to end up acting toxic. I felt and still do now that no one cares about me, everyone is busy with their lives and their friends. I may have friends, but they have THEIR friends who they give more attention to. I have been online and have had friends or mutuals online who have known me for years, but I have always felt i simply cannot fit with them as they share a bigger bond with eachother. Ive just always been a nice, familiar presence that they will interact with regularly. But I have always had experiences of feeling left and felt like I do not matter as much. This applies to real life experiences to. People who just stop making the effort to contact me, under no particular circumstances or conflict. I have always struggled to make friends, and the only long distance friendship I had for over nine years also resulted in stopping contact from their part this beginning of the year. Everytime Ive felt that my relationship with a person is stable and we connect and have known eachother for years, I get proven wrong.",
    "Is my \"popular\" intensive trauma program abusive/unfit/re-traumatizing for me? Im not interested in picking apart my trauma or suppressing what is showing up  I want to be able to meet my needs fully. Things Ive tried  Medication, therapy, meditation, healthy food, exercise, self care, and trauma informed movement. Ive found that mind body integration through somatic work  low dose medication is an amazing combo. Talk therapy has felt highly distressing lately maybe because my providers are not actually trauma informed even though Ive been engaged with different types of talk therapy for the last 8 years and had success. I feel hurt by my intensive program  I started an outpatient intensive partial program in addition to monthly check ins with my pcp  psychiatrist and I think its doing more harm than good. This is where I need your thoughts. 1 The intake staff raised their voice at me but I hoped its just the cruel gatekeepers and that the actual staff will be kind because its supposed to be trauma informed. 2 I got thrown into a 6 hour day when they told me it will only be a quick 20 minute intake. It instead turned into 6 hours of invasive questioning, classes, and therapy  during which I was required to be present and not eat. 2.1 There was no personal check in or regard for the fact that I was highly disregulated because I wasnt allowed to move or eat when hungry. This resulted in a 5 hour panic attack after the day ended, nightmares, and inability to sleep. I struggled with severe body aches for 2 days after because of how distressed I was. 3 Part of the program day was meeting with a psychiatrist that immediately fixated on racially targeted questions  where are you actually from why are you here whats your visa status even though I never brought that up and she assumed Im foreign because Im not white. This meeting lasted 13 minutes after which she told me my current medication is incorrect and I need to be on antipsychotics ? without ever asking me what I need. She interrupted me every time I tried to express what is currently going on. She barely looked at me and spent the whole time eating and looking at the computer. This was the ONLY personalized meeting I have had in this program  everything else was groups or front desk people doing questionnaires.",
    "how to make him feel like he’s not a burden I have a loved one with depression. When he pushes me away, I say stubbornly that Ill stay. But he says that hes a burden. How do I assure him hes not?? Saying youre not a burden is not very convincing. Also I try to be positive and motivational and he tells me not to. what should I do then? I dont know what to say. He also feels guilty that I do so much for him and Ive complained before that my needs arent met well I feel guilty for this. How do I make him feel that what he does it enough and encourage him? How do I ask about needs without pressuring him? Ive pressured him about needs. He wants to break up because he says me pressuring him makes him feel like hes not enough. He says his efforts for the relationship clearly dont make me happy so trying harder is worse for him and me moving forward. Ive messed up because I really did complain I was unhappy with his efforts. we are taking a break now and Ive asked for space. he really wants to push me away for good this time since I was hurting because he couldnt try hard enough for us. He says he has a dark side that will hurt me so he wants to protect me from that and he may not make me happy in the future. But he still loves me he says. whats some things I can say? Should I apologize? I feel really bad. How do I approach him since we are not speaking?",
    "Do you fall out of love when you're depressed? Please. Anyone. My boyfriend and I had been together for 7 months. He first mentioned he was struggling in January with depression and needed to figure it out but had never felt that way before. We were still happy and talking all the time but I could feel him distancing himself still but he wasnt emotionally just physically. Then coronavirus hit... I saw him right before he went back to work in the beginning of it all, he had taken a vacation for 3 weeks when it was starting. After that last time I saw him, it wasnt for another week and a half until I saw him again and he was totally different. He was irritable, quiet, just NOT himself at all. During the time I didnt see him he hadnt seen his children either and it broke him. He broke up with me a week later when I saw he had basically broken down and mentioned he should get some help because he was different and suffering horribly. He said he needed to get better and it wouldnt be fair to me to wait. 2 weeks after ending things I asked if he still loved me and he said he didnt. He cut off all emotion from me. This whole time Id been trying to help him, was supportive, gave him sites to read up on it, got him to tell his mother, and also got him to reach out to a therapist through the fire department. My question is...did the depression make him stop loving me? Did he actually stop loving me or is it masked by his depression? Will he come back? Im drowning in despair and want the man of my dreams back. What do I do? Each time Ive seen him since that last day before he ended things he has been shutting off more and more...and eventually wouldnt see me anymore. Please someone help. I dont know what to do anymore for him. Or even know if he really just doesnt love me.",
    "Could you read me? So, since I was a child I was really close and sometimes, hyper protected to my momand the only other child company that I had was my brother, who is 3 years older than me. My brother is gay, and since always have been very feminine, and we used to play imitating pop singers and famous women. So I start to grew really feminine, but pay attention, IM NOT SAYING THAT THE FACT THAT I WAS FEMININE IS BAD. But when I went to school, the thing was not pretty. I spent the years of 4  11 being extremely rejected by my male colleagues and being accused of wanting to be a woman and being gay. Sometimes I was interested in playing soccer like the other boys, but I knew that I would be bullied Everytime I was feminine which was all the time. And these masculine activities would always have been a strange thing for me. My father was really interested in soccer, but never talk to me about it and my mother always rejected soccer just like every other thing my father liked. My brother... Not interested. But I would still play with him of imitate female singers and sometimes, put a fake dress into us. It was pretty much this dynamic until 2010, when I was 9. My brother and I were still playing this, until, in some moment, he started to touch my penis and put my hands on his penis. Im not gonna lie, I knew something wrong was happening, but I didnt actually think about it as sex. I didnt even knew what sex was, until the moment that he lay in the couch and put his penis, expecting me to blow it. Obviously, only now I realised that he wanted me to do oral sex on him, but at the time I didnt really know what he was wanting me to do. So I just stand there, paralized and nervously laughing. Later, he went to my front and put his butt in my penis and start dancing with it. I just felt so uncomfortable but couldnt get out, for some reason. I just remember crying hard at that night, just very disturbed. I just remember this fact very recently, with therapy. Since then it was just blocked from my mind.",
    "Depression, procrastination and graduation Hello, thats my first post ever on reddit. I am in huge trouble and I put myself there now I need to face this but I dont know what to do. I always had panic attacks and alot of stress since I was just a child. but when I started university it doubled and I came to the point last year where I couldnt get out of bed, let alone study. I closed myself off and didnt get out of my room for a month, That had consequences on my grades and that made me hate myself even more. I used to be very disciplined, a grade A student so that felt like a punch to the guts. Anyway, this year I have a graduation project I need to work on. I thought I learned from that past experience but I really didnt. I was procrastinating out of fear for 5 months now. whenever I start I just start trembling and cant concentrate on anything Im reading. that led me to withdraw from poeple, my teacher my friends because Im too ashamed of my behaviour and I cant face them. Im in deep shit I want to get out of this but I dont know how. This is not how I thought my life and my view towards myself turn out . PS I was taking medications for anxiety and for depression but I stopped them now .",
    "Student nurse with severe depression bout - how can I help? My fiancee is a student nurse after a career change and is currently in her second year. She had setbacks due to COVID and a broken wrist which still requires a reset operation that she is putting off because of training. Her last placement was absolute hell and she had deliberately obstructive staff rather than anyone who would sign off her competencies. She has a history of severe depression and is taking medication, but has really gone downhill for the last month or longer. On the worst days she is barely able to take care of herself and of course it puts our relationship under terrible strain, but I try to help and support where ever I can. She feels trapped in this career path, and has admitted that she is continuing because she feels she has no other options, but I am genuinely afraid that it is killing her. She really wanted to be a community nurse and the ward shifts are taking a serious toll on her mental and physical health. Ive tried to talk about finding other options or just ways to cope with the stress, but shes not really interested at this point. Im terrified for her and the shifts start again in a couple of weeks. I know lots of us have depression me included at times and have just about any career, but I am out of ideas and looking for any advice from healthcare professionals. Is this the wrong path for her?",
    "Has anyone else struggled with post-graduation depression? After 6 grueling and mentally taxing years I finally graduated college a few weeks ago.

It takes a lot for me to get out of bed and I feel my family is disappointed in me. I fear my friends think Im lazy and unmotivated but Id feel silly telling them how I feel at this moment. Its gotten to the point where I avoid dating prepandemic, I have been following social distancing guidelines because I feel like a failure when I tell people I dont know what I want to do. I even avoid talking to family members because I dread the career questions and I feel its strained some of my relationships. Has anyone else experienced something similar?",

I understand all the material at school but dont use it or my resources. I have those off days often and cry almost everyday at school. Some habits I have are staying in my room all day, punching myself when I am in trouble or in the wrong, and sitting on the bathroom floor for prolonged periods of time. I am harassed by a classmate 1516 M in AP World and stopped eating and blamed myself even though Ive never talked to him before.

In 2016 i had friends that i would hang out with that were also my coworkers. We drifted apart and its my fault. After getting a different job i had a lot of coworkers and some would ask to hangout with me, but i always refused. Something changed in me where i began to completely self isolate and push away anyone who tried to come close to me. Im an introvert, so i keep trying to convince myself that i dont want friends.

Im grateful for them, but i feel self conscious because i dont have any other friends my age. I deleted all my social media because seeing my old friends hangout together hurts, as well as seeing posts of people with their friend groups. I waste too much time comparing myself to others.

    "I'm unsure whether I sexually harassed somebody or not, and as a result, I'm extremely depressed. Hi, guys. Im a 23 yearold man with Aspergers Syndrome, and one of the two themes of my pureO OCD over the last two years has been a fear of doing something sexist  this is a manifestation of the moral scrupulosity element of OCD. For the first time ever last summer, I sent a flirtyprovocative text to a woman via the Ask feature on Tumblr, while nonanonymous. The message was an abbreviation followed by a question mark. I remember the post I found her through specifically saying that she was open to receiving these types of messages, yet my brain is trying to convince me that this is false, and obviously because its been so long now, I cant remember what her blog is called and have felt a compulsive need to find her, but cant. I want to die, because I dont want to live with the shame and guilt associated with having potentially sexually harassed somebody, but Im so very certain that she was soliciting these messages, as well as answering similar messages from men on her blog and being receptive to them.

My dad compares me to his former self, and acts like I dont put enough or any effort and treats me like a literal pet. People actively avoid me, because my personality is just straight up fucked, and I act so weird, almost pathetic around others, that Id rather stay at home than humiliate myself in front of others. My biggest problem and fear is that Ill slowly become my father, because he is the most despicable human being I can think of. He is just such a hypocrite, miserable, selfjustifying, rationalizing, condescending piece of shit but I am so similar to him, whether it be personality, tastes, interests, points of view, etc. Another big fear of mine is that no one will validate my efforts, despite it being my best.

We were friends or so I thought, Ive discovered a few months back that shes not just not interested in me, but she absolutely despises me.

    "Is this sexual assault? So when I was five, a group of guys who were inside my school they all looked around 17 to me circled me and one guy asked if my name was Thomas, he said his name was also Thomas there was no way that they could have known my name, I had no friends and had never seen these guys before, and they honestly looked to old to go to my school well they then asked have you every touched yourself? I said no and then one of the guys shoved his hands down his pants and started to jack off, they told me to try it to and I did. The same guy who knew my name asked if he wanted him to do it for me. I said no. My memory gets a little blurry but I remember the guys moving a bit closer to me there. I dont know what happened next because my memory is completely gone. But I do remember that I told my parents small details of it and the next day at school about five or so adults came with me I cant remember if any of them were police and they got some students out of class and asked if any of them did it. they were all in the last year of that school, and none of them looked even half the age of the guys who did it so the people who did it were never caught. Shortly after this incident, I suffered from extreme suicidal ideation, and a many times I even told my parents I was going to kill myself. I have also suffered from separation anxiety all my life since. I am 16M now and only remembered this about a year ago. I am wondering if this is sexual assault. Or is it more, or less?

Im not that close to my family and I only have a couple friends, who seem to be busy most of the time. When Im not obsessing with writing I catch myself day dreaming about a perfect world where I go out on the weekends and have fun.

    "how am I supposed to live in a world like ours? So much pain. So much suffering. So much loss, for so many varied, completely unnecessary reasons. How am I supposed to enjoy a cup of coffee? When I know the suffering we have endured. I cant take myself seriously because I feel the pain, for what very very very little that is worth. How am I supposed to believe that I, me, tiny inconsequential me, is supposed to want to live amongst all of this pain and loss. How am I supposed to live knowing that Im breathing air that could be used by someone else who needs it more than me.",

    "26. Depressed, socially anxious, lost and suicidal. Since i was a little boy I have always been shy. The problem is I never really grew out of it. I have always sheltered myself from doing normal things that probably would have helped me break out of my shell. Now i am 26 and I cant stop dwelling on all of the experiences and fun I have missed out on because of my depression and social anxiety that i had and still have. Even as a little kid I had this problem. For example almost every first day of school I had I cried and wanted to go home. Even at a few of my birthday parties i cried. My parents tried to get me to play football and i even was told i was going to be the quarterback but I stopped going before the season even started because I was afraid and embarrassed to say hike in front of my parents. Looking back I just wish i could be happy like everyone else. I also feel like I lived in the shadow of my 3 older siblings and a lot the energy and focus of my parents was on them, my oldest brother especially. One of the happiest times of my life was the 6th grade, I was in the cool clique at school. I had a lot of friends, one of them being a girl I had a crush on for a couple years before that and I had a lot of confidence and finally began slowly coming out of my shell. After that school year my parents sold our house and we moved to a different town. I knew my parents wanted to move for a while and honestly it was my biggest fear. This devestated me. I literally was in fetal position crying for at least 2 weeks after we moved into the new house. I went from a happy kid to a suicidal 12 year old within a short amoumt of time. Like i said always dealt with shyness and depression but I feel like this put me way back into a hole I could not get myself out of and has turned me into the man i am today. I spent the next 2 years in middle school wanting to end my life. A big part of my brain focuses on high school and that fact that I pretty much did nothing during it besides smoke weed and drink.",
    "I feel like a waste and I don't know what to do. Where do I begin? I guess to start, I recently got engaged to the love of my life back in June youll see why this is important in a second. I am also in a very demanding work industry, in education. Special Education to be more specific. I love working with kids and it can be very rewarding, however, its the most taxing job. My fiancé is a very supportive person while also keeping me realistic. My dream is to stream and I used to and it was fairly successful, to my surprise, when I started. I gained a lot of followers, viewers, and even a few donations even though thats not why I started to do it. My stream was focused on just having fun doing hobby and trying to shine light on mental health. My 1 passion in life is to help others. And I have tried to find careers that revolve around that, but to much dismay. So my stream was to offer advice when asked, listen, and just talk. Talking helps. Even talking about random things. Anyways, she supported me while I did this during the summer. I knew it bugged her that she had to go to work every day and I got to stay home and fulfill a passion of mine. I am drowning at work and it has completely taken over my life. I find no joy in my old hobbies. Watching sports, playing video games, hanging with friends, etc. This past week my fiancé told me that I remind her of a hermit. I hate going out, hanging with friends, all that. I hate having fun is what she told me. Frankly, I realized this before she had told me. Furthermore, I am faced with the decision of resigning from my job and chasing my dream. The repercussions of this is that there wont be stable income coming from me, my fiancé doesnt make enough right now to support us both and we talked about it. We were looking to buy a house in the next year, as well. I feel like Im a waste though. Do I just nut up and suffer just to achieve the goal of getting a house?",
    "I'm drowning I feel like Im drowning. The past couple days I finally felt better... last night it hit me like a ton of bricks. I cant stop crying. It took all the energy I had to go to get coffee and lunch today... even that i took a couple bites and put leftovers up. I just want to crawl in a hole. Im so fucking alone. I cant be open to anyone when my depression gets bad because my whole life if it was bad my family thought I was just wanting attention. I feel like a burden and a waste of space.",
    "Thought I would share this here It all seemed perfect, like it was made FOR me. Problems started emerging in September, first of all it was difficult to find flights to Spain, but then on the night me and my father were supposed to fly, he checked to see if he had all the documents with him, and sadly his pass was past due. So I had to fly alone, and I had no time to process what had just happened, I had to stay focused. Then I received a mail from college stating that those introduction weeks had to be canceled due to Covid casing rising again in the city. I tried to pull through thinking all would be better once classes started, but soon after I got a second mail stating that classes would be mixed so almost all classes would be takes online bar Maths and Physics. Then the third mail came in stating that classes would be taking Online until further notice, possibly until March or february. At this point I had a full on emotional breakdown all the anxiety, nostalgia, frustration and anger came rushing in , I felt I was lied to by College authorities, though they dont control covid , they did tell me that for newcomers classes would be given at campus. So after 1 month I decided I had enough of my European adventure and came back home. This is where I guess my depression started. I now have been accepted by a local Uni, but it doesnt feel rewarding, as it should , it feels empty. I feel like a coward, a loser , like I was not good enough and gave up on my dreams. Like I will never have another opportunity to leave , and that I will be stuck here forever wandering what if... most of all I feel disappointed in myself and extremely sad, and though I do have my familys support, I feel like they dont quite get me, and frankly like they are running out of patience. I dont know, I guessed I needed a space to vent and let my thoughts and feelings out, although it may be silly. I apologize for the long read, and I dont want to sound like a pan y whiny brat with first world problems but , truth be told is that I didnt knew what else to do to express what Im feeling. Thank you , have a happy Christmas.",
    "I have no one. Living in my own for the first time. And I have no one to talk to. Ive moved out on my own under extreme circumstances. So in about August of last year my family and I were evicted from our apartment. My sister is off and married and my brother stayed back in Idaho to finish high school. My mother and I moved to Virginia because my aunt had a house they were paying for but werent living in. And we lived there until January. My aunt is now getting a divorce for leaving her church. And her husband lost his second job. So the house couldnt be payed for and was a liquid asset. My mom had been applying for Disability since shes been the victim of domestic violence with all 3 of her marriges. But since we barely moved to Virgina everything was still based in Idaho. Food Stamps, Medicaid, and goverment records and stuff. So she needed to move back to Idaho and quick. But it took us a month to get to Virginia and cost 3000. We sold our car. So the whole time in virginia I payed for internet, phone plans, and storage back in Idaho with a job at Mcdonalds with no transportation. So we couldnt afford a move back. But a wonderful old friend of my moms back in Idaho that had been housing my brother this whole time decided to pay for a plane ticket back to Idaho for my mom and house her too. So she paid for that and my mom just barely paid her back with tax returns. But right before my mom left I moved to a different town in Virginia I decided to save her money by living on my own with the money I had saved. It has been good for 2 months rent. I had to quit since I didnt have a car and I start a new job tomorrow. But Idk if Ill make enough money for next months rent in time... I realize Im all over the place. But mainly Im on my own. Ever single member of my family is cross country. And I had to leave them all under extreme circumstances. Im homesick and scared of going homeless. I just want some comfort.",
    "Looked in the mirror I have run into 2 major problems in my life atm, it has been eating away at me for the better part of a month. Ill give you some backstory I have people pleaser all my life. I feel like I have always gone with the flow, with peoples expectations of me rather than have my own. I have done that since I was a kid and Im now turning 20 this year, And with that being said the first problem I have run into is, I dont know what I want and like partly due to the depression. But mostly due to the fact that Ive never really done or said what I wanted to to outside forces shutting me down at every turn school, parents etc.. Idk and its driving me up a wall. 2 I thought hard about the people pleaser trait in my being a lot and I have come to this conclusion, I hate who I am. I believe that I am selfish and feel because I havent done what I have wanted in my life I am inauthentic. So I go and look for outside validation and love because I feel like I am incapable of it. But when I receive it, and it doesnt hit the way I wanted it to or things are too fast or far. Like a addict I dump them and look for a new person to give me that feeling I long for. Its fucked up, because the other people care about me and I do to to an extent, but I prioritize my own feelings and shit first. And that realization fucked me up so bad. Real bad. Any thoughts would be great because Im so lost rn. Thanks",

    "Essential worker, trying to fix my depression nest. My husband and I are essential workers, weve been working through the entire pandemic. Opposite shifts, gruelingly long hours and weeks, and extreme pandemic depression. I have been a neat freak since I got out on my own, and he was always a little messy, but could clean up after himself. I was to the point where I was considering ending my life. We hate our jobs, but we cant do anything that pays better right now, we make okay money. We both work 12 hours a day. Our house is in disarray. I lived with a hoarder for years, and it didnt ever feel this bad. Dirty dishes, halffull pizza boxes, trash, our bedroom floor is basically just water bottles at this point. We are both trying to turn it around. Its so overwhelming. If we could get it clean, we could keep up with it. Its just the two of us, and were half dead from work every single day. We get to see each other one day a week. I wish I could just hire someone to help us, but its too messy. I couldnt imagine hiring someone and letting them see how bad our home is. I feel like I cant rest or breathe in this. Where do I even start? What can we do?",

    "What does it take to get better? I guess this is just me bitching about life. I understand you have to put in the work for it to get better. But nobody says what that work entails. Sometimes I wish I had a step by step process of what to do to stop feeling this way. This way feeling like Im not good enough. Logically I know I have a lot going for me and for the first time in my life I feel somewhat content and excited for the future. But my self worth still depends on LOVE. I hate that. I really want to feel happiness inside myself. And I do have things i love about myself. Im a good writer, ambitious, resourceful, conventionally attractive I guess but I enjoy my soul more than my looks. Still, I cant help but think I am worthless and pathetic and that if I dont marry before the age of 25 no man will want me. I also spent a lot of time in theredpill which maybe contributes to this way of thinking. I have traditional values and hate that this generation is so into the hookup culture that perpetuates feeling used up as a way of empowerment. If it makes you happy then more power to you I wish I could have meaningless sex and feel some form of enjoyment. But when all men have ever wanted me for is my body it makes me question if theres any good ones left. Logically i know there must be, by how do I stop attracting the bad ones and more importantly love myself instead?",

    "Too many losses..so much pain So many losses... Im tired. Hurting. And feel alone. The past 78 months have been hard. Ive experienced a lot of losses and they keep coming. First.. I ended a long term relationship in September. We lived in another state I left and returned to our home state. I left him, our home and my job. Eventually.. I lost my car and cat. All of that was hard. My ego hurt because he reconnected with a former ex shortly after I departed within weeks and they are still together. He still attempts to contact me and in moments of loneliness and weakness I have seen him, despite knowing about his relationship. When I returned to my home state I moved in with my sister. She just informed me that her lease is not being renewed and I have to move in two months. My anxiety is thru the roof as I dont know if Ill be able to get the money to move with such short notice. I am working, but its a seasonal position that ends in June. I am looking for permanent work. Lastly, a close friend died over the weekend. She had cancer was diagnosed in December. She had been a big support to me over the years. We talked daily when I lived out of state and every day since I returned. When she received her cancer diagnosis, I was a big help to her. I feel hurt, lonely and alone. My circle of friends has always been small and it continues to get smaller. Right now I feel like I dont have anyone. Id like to see a therapist, but most dont accept my insurance. Besides that will also expire in May. I also feel hopeless. Im in my 50s so starting all over again feels daunting.

    "I study at university and things have become EXTREMELY difficult Im a university student and recently things have become really tough. There are several problems that Ive got no idea how to solve 1. Social anxiety its insanely stressful for me to interact with people. My classmates are girls and Im the only guy in the group so it makes interactions even harder cause I try to be nice with them. Sometimes I get random panic attacks dizziness, increased heartbeat, sweaty and trembling palms that make it impossible to talk to anyone or even to keep up with what the teacher is saying during lectures. Moreover, I cannot even approach my crush, cause this girl is very cute and adorable 2. Irritated bowel syndrome this thing makes my life like ten times harder. I have to endure extreme pain all the time and I also often get late for classes. Recently one of my teachers hes not aware of this problem has told me that he wont let me in for the class if I get even a minute late ever again. IBS  panic attacks also make things like public speaking extremely difficult 3. Conscription the main reason I study at university is to avoid it. For me conscription is constant beating, humiliation, shitty food, life without sleep and weekends and being in a tough environment 247. My health is not good enough to endure conscription, I just wont stand it. Also if Im gonna have a girlfriend, she is not gonna wait for me to return. Most girls here break up with their boyfriends if those get conscripted. There are several other problems like studying in the faculty that I dont like but cannot change faculty because here its almost impossible. Psychological help is also very expensive and mostly useless here so for me its not an option. What am I supposed to do to solve it? How can I make this life better?",

I got involved in a relationship that didnt end up in a relationship due to his and my own mental instability. He refused to work together on it and trying to work on some things we both had issues with. This made me feel as if he didnt really care about me. Tonight he told me he definitely did not have romantic feelings for me anymore.

I have had this other friend for a long long time. Lets call her Amy Throughout high school, Amy and I had issues because her mother absolutely despised me and created issues for our friendship. I am pretty sure she blamed a lot of stuff on me to her mom so she wouldnt get in trouble for it. As a result, I began getting left out of our friend group a lot and was treated like an outcast. She has been a pretty shitty friend to me. Last year, Amy moved away to go to a different college, which made things so much easier for me, life was going great. But this summer she moved back to town and is transferring to our hometown college. Immediately life started going back to how it used to be. Katie hangs out with them a ton and I am just alone and dont really get invited. I ended up saying something to Katie and asked her if she thinks everyone is going to start excluding me again and I said something like, Since Amy moved back, everyone flocks to her like she is crack.

If Ive fucked up in a relationship or Ive hurt someone I loved, I apologise. Even if I am right, I apologise because my father taught me that is the way to do things in relationships with people. I am always the nice guy in the relationshipsfriendships and Ive started to think that Im just some betamale that shouldve been discarded a long time ago. I have no confidence in my social abilities and I often feel lonely as a result, but then when I am with others I usually feel like a black sheep andor get irritated with the company to the point where I dont want to be around them. I just got a promotion in my job and didnt even smile or think that it was a good thing. My boss even questioned me if I was happy or excited, to which I replied yes straightfaced. I am confident in my abilities in my job and it is not boring or mundane, but I place no value on it because jobs are something we must do in order to survive. Nothing excites me anymore. I have lost passion for everything. And I just wallow about in selfpity, trying not to become distraught through rage or unhappiness. Until recently I was calling up my parents almost every day enraged or crying with despair. I am sick of dragging everyone down with me because of my emotional outrage. Thus, I have made the decision to cut off all contact with everyone I know, family included. My gut feeling is telling me to never speak to anyone ever again because I am so sick of trying. Trying to please everyone, trying to better myself, and trying to do anything. I never take to the internet in search for solutions, but if anyone knows how to change their attitude so that they may continue on the pursuit for happiness, then please, I beg of you, share your wisdom. I dont want to be this person.",
    "I can’t make it stop I have reoccurring thoughts and day dreams of ending it. Day and night just seeing myself downing my stash of pills before going to bed or copying 13 reasons and going out in the tub. It helps to have distractions like personal time or gaming but its getting harder to focus on hobbies projects and stuff like that. I feel like Jack Nickelson in Over the Coo Coos Nest or Shining. I dont trust the places I have left to vent. Reddit always buried my posts for help which reeeeaaaly helps with the invisible feeling and the only people I feel confident enough to confined in are too busy. In a fucked up sense I dont want to go into therapy other than lack of funds because I could be taking time from the therapist helping someone... worth it. If that makes any sense.",
    "I'm truly stuck - can't quit, can't work. Can't get out of bed. Desperate for any advice. Im a grad student and Im suffering from depression. My progress has been slow in the last one year and my relationship with my PI is strained. Even before this pandemic, I was barely managing to do anything. Im in a different country and my visa depends on my PhD. It was my dream to do it. Even against my familys wishes, I secured funding and it was wonderful. I dont know what to do. Im really slipping. I cant seem to do anything with regard to work. But I cant seem to do anything else either. All the time I dont work, I spend feeling guilty about not working. I feel like a rat, which gets a shock if it goes right and gets a shock if it goes left at the end of a T . So its stuck. I am running out of time to finish this degree. Im making progress in therapy and even doing it several times a week. But its not helping me change my present. I wont get an opportunity like this again and see it slipping out of my hands. It makes me feel like an unreliable, irresponsible person. I dont want to be that person. I dont want to selfsabotage. I try my best everyday. I sit down to work. My therapist even said I was the most diligent patient hes met. Please point me to something. Anyone. Ill do anything.",
    "I cant get help How? How do you guys reach out. Its like, yea i want help with my problems, but I just cant reach out. I walk by my schools councillor every day, and I just think, Ill talk to him about my shit tommorow, even though I know im lying to myself. I cant fucking tell anyone, my subconcious just says no. Even when I want to, I just freeze up and try to cover myself. Like, I know reaching out is what I should be doing, I just mentally cant. Ive dreamt about one of my friends finding my reddit account and seeing my post, and reaching out so I dont have to, but I also fear it. What do i do?",
    "List of ways to treat yourself So Im writing a list of nice things to do for myself when I really feel awful and have been too mean to myself. Was wondering what pick me ups you guys have as I want this list to be super super long and range from things that are completely free like painting my nails to paying for things like a massage, things that require barely any effort for the days I cant get out of bed like maybe songs to play and things that are super adventurous and cool for those few days I have bursts of energy and ambition. Absolutely anything you can think of! !",
    "I just sit here and feel like crying And I cant do even that, since I seem to have crying block. That aside, Im just really hopeless. And the worst is, I dont even know why exactly Im feeling like that at the moment. I feel really overwhelmed, like I cant wrap my head around it all. Im lonely, I dont know what to do career wise, Im tired. So fucking tired. So I open up my laptop, and watch a movie, or series. And I feel even worse, cause Id prefer their reality to mine. And Im nothing like I wish I was,and I feel so often pretty much worthless because Im not accomplished. And I wish I had some kind of purpose because it all feels so fucking aimless. Im just tired.",
    "Is it just me or does depression sometimes come and go? I 16M have been struggling with depression for quite awhile now and Ive wanted to know does it usually come in waves? For me I can stay happy for a period of time with little to no suicidal thoughts before suddenly slipping back into a pretty horrible state of depression. I feel like theres some triggers but they dont exactly cause the full blown depression state but maybe my overthinking pushes me into a bowl of shit and I was wondering maybe whether it was just for me or maybe its for other people struggling with depression.",
    "I have no one else to talk to Well, here goes... Im 30 years old and work as a systems administrator for a tech company. I work long hours 1013 a day, specifically, and I dont have much to show for it. Not without showing appreciation for what I have I can pay my rent for the tiny, but cozy apartment we live in, the lights are on and theres food on the table, but its so, so very hard to maintain that. Im not complaining or blaming anyone, but Im the only person in my house that has the ability to work. But after the last couple years, even Im starting to struggle. I have borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder with psychosomatic symptoms. I willingly starve myself when I feel fat and ugly. Im on five different types of medication, all of which cost nearly 100 for me to get. My partner is also dependent on medication. Were both ill, but their situation is a bit tougher than my own. We cant afford to see the doctor often, no matter how hard i work. I make decent pay, but because of our crippling debt and the growing housing crisis, I have to work 5060hrs a week just do we have enough money left to get groceries. I feel like a failure. I come from a wealthy family that has all but abandoned me. I have my mother still, who is as supportive as she can be, but even she struggles to help me when Im at my worst. Up until recently, I used to allow myself to succumb to my feelings and share them often. But all that did was cause those I spoke to to worry about me. Theyre understandably frustrated because simply talking doesnt always help me. Theres so much stress and anxiety in my mind that Im constantly in pain and telling my loved ones that either scares them or leaves them speechless. My partner told me they feel helpless when they see me this way, cried while saying that too. My mom told me the same. So... I decided to wear a false smile and tell them Im okay so I dont make them feel that way anymore. Its not fair to spread my pain to others. Their problems are so much bigger than mine.",
    "This is too long and no one likes reading long shit but I just can’t take it anymore idk what to do Today I woke up to the sound of my neighbours bellow me screaming, arguing and slamming shit. Its been happening more often lately, especially on the weekends. I have ptsd, bpd, amp severe GAD amp depression. I moved out of my parents 4 years ago to escape a toxic home. I was raised in a family who always screams at each other, constant bickering, slamming shit and breaking furniture. I have grown severe mental issues because of my childhood and flinch easily at loud noises. I live in a very old apartment building in a rough part of town because its all I can afford. Covid robbed me of my dream job amp all friendships, so I have been a loser sitting at home playing video games all day to escape reality while living off EI. Im pretty sure my benefits just ended today, idk, Ive been too scared to look. Ive saved up 3 months worth of rent and Im too scared to spend any money because I dont want to get a job because Im too adhd for university and couldnt pick a career for the life of me. Now Im a jobless loser with 0 ambition to be a wage slave. I am stuck living in this apartment that used to be the nicer part of the shit area. Well thanks to covid, my rental management accepts anyone amp everyone to keep rooms filled so now theres lots of crackheads and sketchy people who live here. The lobby is always filled with garbage now, homeless peoples bikes and garbage bags parked INSIDE the lobby while they buy crack from suite 18 bc they marked in the elevator. Oh theres now crackheads spraying grafiti on the inside of the elevator door too. I am living in a shithole, but this is what I get for being a useless loser living in poverty. The walls and floors are paper thin so I awoke to the couple beneath me screaming and slamming. I left the apartment at 10 am to escape the incoming panic attack I would have if I listened to it any longer. I come back at 2pm praying they would be done, but nope. Still screaming at each other.",

Sometimes i dont do my morning routine and i just go to school, even if i had time to do my morning routine i mostly just watch something from my phone and then go to school. Lately i have been kinda too much out of school, because od this problem. I know one reason im so tired at morning is because i havent slept very well. I have waked up early like 78 am, but i just dont have motive to go up at that moment so i decide to stay on bed and think something sad or be on my phone. Any tip is more than welcome.",
    "24yo disabled female wants to reset my life Ive recently come to the conclusion that no matter what I do with my life it doesnt improve or move anywhere. Im 24yo, confined to an electric wheelchair from a condition that no one can tell me if I will degenerate from or not, Ive never been in a serious relationship and every dating experience Ive had has ended in disaster and heartbreak thats taken me months to get over.

I can be talking to people and have a great friendship with them and then they just totally... Disappear? Whenever Ive reached out, we might have a very distant conversation and then that conversation stops and we just dont talk again for ages unless I contact them. And even then, its just the same thing? So eventually I stop reaching out and they never send me anything. And this has happened multiple times with people I was very close with.

    "Should I quit my job? Everyday i ask myself this as soon as I wake up to get ready to clock In. A bit of background I was unemployed for a few months last year and this January finally got full time work again. My job is for a contact center and I work from home which was great at first but after 6 months on the job I feel like absolute trash. Im am being paid a decent wage but Im starting to wonder if its worth it. Every day I wake up dreading the following 8 hours and on my days off I feel like I can never truly rest. It doesnt help that our metrics are scrutinized daily and were written up when goals arent met. So every other week Im met with the threat of being terminated. Ive gotten to the point that Im using sick time time off just to not have to deal with it. I need to work but the job I have depletes my literal will to live. Ive usually been good being able to cope but this one has been the most difficult yet. Im not sure how much more I can make it or what else I can do that lol not require me to speak of the phone to so many people for so many hours. Any suggestions welcome as I am running out of options to cope and fear having to quit a full time job once again.",

I feel like if I told him about all this it would just add to his stress. Ive thought about putting myself on a psychiatric hold but I havent. I just dont know what to do anymore. I have nobody to talk to. I have a suicide diary in my phone. Ive attempted before when I was 16, so almost 10 years ago. I dont want to commit suicide, I just want something bad to happen to just me and I die. I know this is wrong and not a good sign, I know I need to see a therapist and get on more medicine but we have no insurance. I cant help but feel obnoxious, like a burden, unwanted, unloved, like Im just being used, like Im a terrible wife and mother. I even wrote in my suicide note that if Im ever found dead, to cremate me and throw me in the trash. I dont want to die necessarily because of my boys and my husband, I love them more than anything. I just cant help these thoughts and I feel terrible about it. And my husband has no idea, and neither do my boys. I just want to feel like Im enough, I guess. I dont even know if this makes sense.

    "How do I(32F) support my husband (45M) through depression My husband and I have been together for 6 years, married for 5 and overall have a wonderful relationship. He truly is my best friend. We have worked through numerous issues and hes done a lot of work on his mental health, but refuses to go to any type of treatment we also cant afford anything. He quit his job about a month prior to the pandemic hitting and has been unemployed since. He tries to supplement income with doing food delivery, but even that has slowed down as time has progressed through no fault of his own, he schedules and works, but orders are far and few between. He has always struggled with anger and depression and has narcissistic tendendacies, but recognizes that and tries to work through it. How can I currently support him? He recognizes that hes spiraling into his dark place but doesnt think anything can help. Lack of income contributes greatly. At the start of the pandemic I helped him start a YouTube channel to give him something to focus on and have goals, but now that has just turned into more frustration and its work as opposed to fun. Is there anything I can do to help him? I feel like my positive attitude is just making things worse. TLDR My husband is spiraling into a dark place, how can I help him?",
    "Could someone offer some advice on how to be a functioning adult? Ive been depressed my entire life. Because of this, Ive spent all of my time doing what was required of me such as homework, taking care of basic needs such as eating or sleeping, and mindlessly refreshing social media or the news. I have no hobbies or interests or skills or ability to take care of my mental wellness. I can probably survive on a physical level I know how to work, how to pay taxes, how to pay bills, how to get in contact with someone to rent an apartment, that sort of thing. But I have no idea how to stop being so miserable all of the time. I cant keep a job without feeling suicidal almost every day because I need to work although I force myself to keep one anyways, I cant pick a future career path, I cant motivate myself to pursue hobbies, I cant even do things that make me feel happy because nothing really does as far as I know. What Im asking is how do I stop just surviving and start living? How do I fit a fulfilling life around all of this stress and overwhelming deadlines and responsibilities? How do I actually be an adult? I can do the basic things I need to in order to keep my physical body alive, but I have no idea how to do anything beyond that.

Ive rescheduled this appointment like 3 times because Ive been so nervous about it, but tomorrow is the day I just suck it up and go in to talk to a doctor about the option of starting depression meds. Im excited to take this step for myself, but I guess Im just nervous about talking to someone outside of my therapist about my depression. Im worried Ill be judged or they wont believe me.

    "My friends doesn't believe in be and doesn't respect my wish to be alone for a while Yesterday I saw her big brother on the street and I kinda had to say hello to him. Yesterday was the same day I startet therapy, so I looked like a mess  was a little embaressed because hes god damn beautiful and has always flirted with me. I told him to say hello to ST, tell her shes missed and that she shouldnt be worried because Ill still keep my promise and get back when Im ready to be social again. yearh, because I knew he would tell her he saw me.... 5hours later she texted me twice Hey, Im SO WORRIED! I need to know that youre okay?Hey, just like my message  you dont have to write a long message or anything Im a mix between angry and understanding. maybe shes concerned that Ill take my life again? And this is her way to show love  just showed through concern? but Im SO angry for the fact that she doesnt trust in me? Her concern makes me so angry... Ive already messaged her TWO TIMES even though I told her I wouldnt answerany messages. Telling her Im fine and that Ill get back. Can she just leave me the f alne and believe that Im doing fine, taking one small step at a time. THIS is one of the reasons why I had to take a break from people. If I believe in their concern about me not getting better, I wont be better. The last time my dad told me he though I would kill myself  I wasnt having some selfharming thoughts. But then I started having them  just to prove that he was right. I wont let this selfdestructive way of pleasing get in touch with me again. And being away from people, only having contact with my mom, has changed my habits into being able to wake up, going outside, making food once in a while and start to work on my traumas. But know, because of her messages, I fear I get stuck in the believe of not recovering. I know its not her wish, but thats how it affects me... My therapy sessions is mainly about relations.",
    "Heavy Shame From Drunken Past Starting around 2015, I tried to fix my depression with alcohol. Stupid, I know. Im sober and I think quite a lovely person now, but I cant stop remembering back then, and feeling this all consuming shame that makes me want to die. First instance, I was nervous aboutat a social gathering. I drank too much and dont remember everything, but I think I spoke to a poor, nice guy about Shakespeare and my dream of being a writer and god knows what for ages, and then I was just obnoxious. Not my shy self anymore. Talked loud. Tried to high five somebody who left me hanging because, well, you couldnt blame them. Just awful cringy. I did a semi burp, I think, which alerted my friends, who got me into the bathroom, and then I remember being half asleep in a chair, with that lovely guy trying to reassure me that I would be getting home soon. My mum eventually came and got me. I threw up in a bin outside, and was spouting Yeats poetry whilst stumbling with my mum and my friend holding me up. I cant stop remembering, and feeling this suicidal, heavy shame. Then, 2017, I met my boyfriend. Gorgeous human being. For maybe three out of the four years weve been together, Ive been a sporadic drunk. Drinking at home. Getting drunk. Crying my eyes out. Or angrily breaking up with him, selfsabotaging. Hes had to take the locks off all the doors so I dont do something stupid and he cant get in. One night, I even blanked out. I dont drink like that anymore, but I cannot stop thinking about how horrible it wouldve all been for him. I was so needy, horrible, greedy, drunk, and delusional. And no matter how much I apologise and try to make up for it, I still feel rotten. He keeps telling me to forget about it, not linger in that place, and that hes forgiven me, but how can he?",

    "This is a cry for help... My story is a little bit long so I apologize for that. Im a step away from suicide. Ive been dealing with depression for at least 19 months now, and everything sucks. Hi there. Im a 19 year old boy from Iran. First let me make it clear that Im an atheist and this is story isnt from a religious perspective. But Iran has a religious culture and government which has affected this story. I grew up lonely. My mother and father were never there for me. They just had a lot of expectations from me cause I was a smartass kid. But they never really cared about the pressure they put me through or my feelings. I started dating when I was 18. Yeah, a year ago. How did I start dating? It was my last year in high school and I was studying the shit out of myself to get accepted in a great university. Just 5 months before the big test, I was so sick from the pressure. I needed someone. I needed someone to love, someone to love me. my family sucks. So I started dating this girl who was the same age I was. One thing I need to explain to you guys is that relationships in Iran are really different from Europe or USA. They proceed a lot faster. I know its wrong. But its part of the modernreligious culture that you live in. For example you have to say I love you in the first month. Crazy, isnt it? Also most relationships in iran dont include sex. Cause most people in iran believe that hymen test is scientific. And doctors are making money of this myth. Fuck. So I started dating her and we dated for 2 months. I became extremely obsessed with her. I loved her so much. Please dont judge me for that. It was my first serious relationship and I completely fell in love. She told me the same. But after 2 months she told me that she cant get her ex out of her mind and broke up with me. Making me realize I was just a rebound. I spent the next 8 months completely depressed.",
    "How do I gauge the success of my antidepressant without knowing what the “best case scenario” actually feels like? At this moment in time, I am on 60mg prozac a day. I just cant seem to stop wondering about how to know when I have found the correct prescription. It has been a few months of increasing the dose and Id like to believe it has been helping me, but I cant tell if its all in my head or if it is just coincidence I have been having one or two good days a week instead of none. prozac is the only antidepressant I have been prescribed over the years, and while I am hesitant to try something unfamiliar, the idea that there might be a more effective medication crosses my mind frequently. I struggle greatly with low energy levels motivation fatigue and it would suck to know that all of this time I could have been pursuing a prescription that was a better fit. I feel like I have been making decisions blindly simply because I dont have the experience of another antidepressant to compare the effectiveness.",
    "Teenager with no hope. Im a senior in high school right now, and as far as I can tell, I have a bleak future, and an even bleaker present. Im too lazy to get grades better than Cs, and my social life is worse than an 80 year old retiree with a dead spouse and estranged children. I feel as if my default state is depressed, with small bouts of happiness, then back into the trenches for me. I keep thinking Ive found happiness in the love of someone else, only for it to be stomped out and kicked until I taste the blood. I can make people laugh and they seem as if they like me, but when the school day ends and everyone goes home, no one calls, no one texts, and I doubt anyone thinks of me. Its gotten so bad, I dont even like to listen to music anymore, something I used to look forward to a little while ago, now it just seems like unnecessary noise. Every time someone asks what college Im going to and I reply with X Community College, I see the disappointment in their eyes. It seems as if everyone else has these nice lives, and the perfect SO. Dont get me wrong, Ive had girlfriends, but they never lasted long and ultimately didnt mean much to either person. I know they say having an SO just causes more strife and pain, but I just want to see what a proper relationship is like and experience the life everyone else talks about. I know this story has been told before by countless people before me, and will be told by countless people after me. I just want to escape all of this. Im not suicidal yet, but I fear what comes next. Wow, I sound like a pretentious asshole reading this back. I just want to know if anyone else has experienced this, and what you did.

Shortly before that both my parents were diagnosed with stage 4 and 5 cancer lung and colorectal and are on their death beds  I have had to quit my job to care for them full time. I cant get out of bed and havent for weeks  I cant eat and am down to 37kgs. Ive been in hospital with a feeding tube but took it out and discharged because I genuinely dont want to live any more. I have no one to talk to and I dont see any other option. Ive tried to be positive for so long but I feel like I have no energy left to try anymore. I dont know why Im posting this I just hope maybe if someone has been in a similar position they can tell me about their experience I guess. This is my first and final cry for help.",
    "Depression and anxiety making it difficult to do work Im depressed and anxious a lot, especially because I need to write a report for work. Its the end of my work term its a summer research job and my results arent great. Its been an awful summer and I cant face this report. I feel physically unable to work on it, and I cant eat or sleep. I havent eaten a full meal in several days. I need to work on this report, but I just feel terrible and like I cant. How can I force myself to do it?",
    "I'm nothing without my medication. Hey, im Bradley. Im turning 16 close to the end of this year. This years exams that are upcoming are really, really important and will determine my near future. Its stressful, but I always avoid getting stressed. Heres where the first problem comes in when im not stressed, I dont worry about the exams. So in the end, theres completely no effort when the day comes. Medication started about a month or two ago. So far, ive missed some days and yes, my psychiatrist knows. I wont elaborate on my problems but basically I have been diagnosed with depression after close to 3 years of suffering in silence. And it has been tough. Seeking help didnt relieve me that much, but it did. My mood changed a little, im kind of more positive in terms of my everyday life. Just school, sports and home. A cycle. Everytime theres signs which are triggers, but im afraid of telling my teachers or psychiatrist because im just too scared to im always getting into that depressive episode. I get easily angry, especially to my friends and I tend to be impulsive during these anger moments. Its tough dealing with depression. Really tough. Medication just makes it seem like I cant handle things on my own, and drugs are needed just for my mood to get better I mean, when I was a child it was so easy to be happy, why not now?. I seem to never forget that without medication id be dead. I dont know if I should see it that way or whether I should take things on my own. Its masculinity, right? If we could handle this, were stronger than others, right? People always tell us that itd be better if they understood what I was going through, but must I really tell _everyone_ that I have depression?",
    "Help with insomnia because of depression? Hey guys. Im looking for some advice for how to deal with insomnia that gets worse when my depression does. Ive tried the whole putting my phone down 30 minutes before bed, reading, occasional melatonin supplements, and nothing has really worked. Anyone with advice or personal bedtime routines that have helped with insomnia would be much appreciated. Im currently a college student and having depression and insomnia on top of it is leaving me completely drained and at a loss of what to do.",
    "How do you love yourself when you don't see any value there? Hey all. Im turning to you because... Im not sure where else to go. Im living in Melbourne, Australia at the moment. Getting help is tougher than I ever imagined. Mental health organisations are overworked and understaffed. Therapy sessions are far from affordable. And I am holding on to my last string. To be honest, I have been for some time. My whole life, Ive felt undesirable and worthless. I dont see much value in myself or what I do, and I never have. I constantly feel like a waste of space. It has me thinking is life really worth living this way? I met someone who made me feel otherwise... at least for a while. But the honeymoon phase is long over and as he retreats back into his shell of commitmentless comfort, I melt into a puddle of misery. Perhaps its because I know the one thing Im unequivocally good at is loving someone else. So maybe I should learn to love myself instead. But how do I do that when I cant see any value in myself? Its an impossible task.",
    "Please help me Hey guys im a 18 yo boy and i feel like the fate is not within me. I am so unlucky for all the things i do. I recently got friendzone by my crush and i think i might be turning into my old self again. Once i get attached to a person it is so hard to i feel like i dont want that person leave my side. Weve been talking 6 months but i easily fall inlove with a one person. I dont know what to do, all aof my friends know that Im in pain again.

    "I can’t handle myself Hello, this is a throwaway account. I am female, 21 and was diagnosed with severe depression and a bipolar personality disorder. Ive been feeling depressed for 7 years now and last year I finally found myself strong enough to see a doctor and since then Ive been trying to get therapy but its basically impossible since I dont have private insurance. I am on plenty of waiting lists but Ive not yet gotten one call back. I am scared that at some point it will be too late because Im gone. I want therapy so badly. I need it. I am not able to live a normal life at all, everything weights me down no matter how small the issue is. It affects my daily life way too much. When I start panicking, starting to cry, scream, hurt myself, I want to have myself locked up, so someone can look over me, give me medication, etc. I really want that but the thought of it scares me insanely much. Right now, the only thing bringing me joy is spending time with my boyfriend online. Weve been together for a year now and it couldnt be more perfect, except my disorder ruining a lot of things. I play games with him online, we have so much fun. I dont want to lose that. Additionally I am studying and Id be done next year and graduate. However without some kind of help I know I wont be able to do it. I already had to repeat a whole year because of my issues. I dont know what to do. I really want to be somewhere where I am being watched so I can get help anytime I need it. But I have so much to lose. My partner, my dog, my computer, what if they even take my phone? I started writing this to calm down from another panic attack over something super small and it helped me calm down but I rarely have something to make me calm again so all I usually do is scream and cry and hurt myself for two hours till my body is too tired to even stay awake so I basically just pass out... I need advice, support, anything I just need to talk about this",
    "How do i ask for help? I have a couple people who constantly tell me that they are there in case i need to talk. Im scared that i might end up doing something and ive been contemplating telling one of them for the past week but i dont know how to go about it. Ive tried asking to talk about something i didnt say suicide specifically a couple times to one of them but It either ends up being a bad time, or i just chicken out on the day we were supposed to talk. How am i supposed to go about doing this without feeling scared, or feeling like i might offend them in some way",
    "I’ve been waking up late at night with a really strong panicky urge to kill myself Ill just wake up at like 4 or 3 AM and Ill feel like crying and like im about to have a panic attack and keep thinking about why I havent i killed myself yet.

Ive been suicidal for a while but this is new",
    "I am close to snapping and destroying myself and everything around me Im a patient person. I never lash out. I never once had a outburst of anger. I always directed that anger and shame into hating myself. I suspect that I might have quiet BPD , but I dont want to seem like an attention whore trying to selfdiagnose. Where I live is hell. I do not feel understood by my therapist. I feel like all I do is fucking, WHINE, WHINE WHINE WHINE. I live with my grandparents. My grandpa has done some bad things to me. My grandmother is an cold abusive bitter shell of a women that points out EVERYTHING I do wrong. Nothing I do is good enough. ITs always the negatives. My mother is well. I dont know how the fuck to describe her. I use to idolize her as a cihld and used to feel special for being so close to her. Now I see how its fucking impossible to share my feelings and point of view with her because she just thinks Im blaming her. My father left me with a child molester. And even laughed at me while I was crying, begging him to care and give a shit. To at least PRETEND TO CARE. Nah he just laughed at me. I have severe anxiety. I cannot do anything by myself. I am very dependent. I feel helpless. I also really , really fucking hate myself. People have told my parents how stubborn and rigid i was as a child and kept telling them how I was going to be a bad person as I got older and not support my parents. And everytime id do something wrong my parents would bring this up and itd bring me so much anxiety its not even funny. I impuslivly bought a pack of blades. I tried talking to my therapist yesterday and it just didnt feel like she cared. She just wanted mee to do DBT SKILLS AND THATS ALL SHE FUCKING TALKED ABOUT. NO ONE LISTENES TO ME. NO ONE GIVES A FUCKING SHIT. THE PEOPLE WHO USED TO CARE LIKE MY MOM ARE TIRED OF MY USELESS ASS. I already cut myself today.",
    "my LDR boyfriend admitted he has depression and wants a break because of it for context, my boyfriend and I are in an ldr for over 1.5 years now. hes from japan and im from america. depressionmental illness are very much taboo, as is even things like therapy, in japan. its just not something thats socially acceptable to even talk about there, so i cant imagine how hard it must be for him now. weve never had any major fightsdisagreements until this confrontation happened on thanksgiving day. he has been studying abroad in europe for the semester, and its definitely taken a toll on him he knows and admits that this is one of the major reasons he is feeling the way he is now. hes homesick, doesnt have any close friends, and has recently found out one of his best friends from high school is addicted to drugs. overall.... its been a really crazy semester for him, and lots of shitty things happening in my personal life as well. its just not a good year for either of us, but our relationship has been really strong. i had just booked a nonrefundable flight to visit him for christmas, my birthday, and through to new years. i noticed that, compared to when we discussed this visit during our last time together 1st week of november, he was significantly less excited. i knew something was off, but he wouldnt say. this weird vibe kept persisting through the week, and on thanksgiving night, i asked him what was wrong. he finally admitted to me paraphrasing i dont think i can love you anymore. not because i love someone else or lost interest in you, but im feeling really depressed recently, and i cant enjoy things. i cant even be excited for your visit. now, im just needing a break. Im not saying I wanna cut you off completely, but at this moment idk how to even talk to you. what Im doing is not giving up, but cleaning myself up. i just need time. he keeps saying things like this, which is hard for me to accept because I know what its like to be depressed.",
    "It takes me several hours to even get out of bed When I wake up, I feel absolutely exhausted and I usually have a headache and feel very dehydrated in the mornings as well. If I wake up at 11am for example, I will often fall back asleep and not even be able to get out of bed until at least 2pm. Today was even worse, I only got out of bed at 330pm, which means half of my day is already wasted when I get up out of bed. I dont know whether its the depression making me do this or what but its the one of the worst things I have to go through on a daily basis and one of my biggest obstacles. Anyone else like this?",

This has been happening on and off for over 5 years now, maybe longer. Every now and then Ill have a few good days but the bad ones never seem to end. I wake up in the morning and just want to go back to bed even tho I have so much i could do. Its like I have no drive or motivation. I dont know why Im here or what the point of my life is. Everything seems to meaningless and I just cant seem to find my way. Ive tried hobbies, hanging out with friends, talking to people... but its all so temporary. Im yearning for love and attention and when I dont receive it from my significant other, it cripples me. Im too needy and insecure and dont have any sense of self. I feel like thats going to cause my relationship to end as well. Ive tried therapy for years and it helped temporarily but then became another meaningless part of my routine.

    "I feel depressed but feel like even more of a loser for feeling depressed. Sympathy always makes me feel guilty, really no matter what its about. Its been a cycle ive dealt with for years now and i dont know that its even boiling over into anything harmful to me on the outside but im tired of it bringing me down. Part of why its hard to talk about is because i can only imagine the eye rolls when hearing about some rich kid complain that hes struggling when people are probably in 10x worse situations than me. I get it. But I figured reddit is anonymous so if people think im a loser then who cares. I think if i told most people what im going through they would just say im an overworrier and overthinking, but at this point im tired of life just sucking. Im tired of relative failure my whole life. And like i said im tired of only being so good at putting negative thoughts about myself in the backburner and not allowing them back into my usual frame of mind. They just never fail to come back and haunt me. The only way i can continue push forward is to find some self worth. I dont even know why i came to this sub. I just thought about it and felt like it was an opportunity to let out some emotions that ive been holding for a long time now. Maybe as an opportunity to learn more about it because of my long reluctancy to ever face my depression head on and always dance around it and pretend to not let it affect me unless im in an environment where its safe to do so, which is just by myself. Thanks to anyone with any kind of insight, positive or negative. Ive tried to always be a realist with myself despite my issues in conjuring up some sense of self worth.",
    "I'm 20 and I kinda sorta hate myself Sup Im 20 and I genuinely feel hopeless and hate myself. I dont really feel like theres anything in my life to be super proud of, like Ive been unemployed for a few months, I dont have a drivers license, Ive never had a girlfriend, Im not in super great shape and I hate myself for not taking steps to change anything. Its like Id rather just wallow in my own sadness then actually go do something about it even though all I want to do is be happy. I dont want to sound like the stereotypical 4chan incel but the never having a girlfriend part especially bothers me, like to the point where if I see a pretty girl in public or I see someone my age on social media being in a nice relationship or something I get like jealous and sad, and I dont want to be like that I should be happy for those people but Im just not. I feel like such a huge loser who is going to be stuck just loathing myself forever. Any of my friends or family members Ive spoken to have told me it will get better and Im a great dude but it just doesnt make me feel any less worthless to myself. Id appreciate anything anyone has to say. Thanks.",
    "I feel like the things that should make me happy won’t. Ive always liked video games, and always had the thought that not much in the real world really felt worth it or like it would do much for me, but a lot of the time even video games just feel like a distraction. Same with people. I can appreciate a lot of things, but dont really expect them to fill me with much of a sense of joy or something. They say relationships are the biggest predictors of happiness, and even though I love my family I almost dont know if I feel it. I just feel the pain at the thought of losing them or if they lost me. Its like I am only driven by moving away from pain and pleasure is fleeting if at all possible. Until recently I thought I was completely emotionally numb from medication but Im trying to entertain the idea its OCD and depression that makes me like this, because thats more fixable. I feel like when thinking of hobbies, or jobs, or things to devote my life too I just ask myself but why would I do this over anything else?",

    "What if it’s scientifically impossible to get better As the the title says what if its just scientifically impossible. Think how millions of people commit suicide, whos to say that any of them had a chance of getting better. While sure other people recover from depression, we all know depression works on a scale, whos to say there isnt a cut off point in which there is literally no hope for recovery? Obviously we dont know everything about the brain so this is entirely a possibility. I dont know if this is even requesting support to be honest as, I feel like, as my post suggests, support might just be useless and Im destined to die depressed. I guess this is more of a last minute cry for help before I just give up and accept Im gonna kill myself at some point",
    "Afternoon Anxiety and Depression For the past couple of months I have had really bad anxiety and depression at night. I have been dealing with both for years now, almost I think since middle school, Im 27 now. However, since August of last year, when I had my first and only anxiety attack, I was out with my friends and my anxiety got so bad that I had force them to call me an uber so I could just go home and sleep it off. I told myself and my parents that if I didnt feel better in the morning, I was going to the hospital. I never felt that bad in my life and I have been worried about it happening again. There are a lot of stressful things going on in my life right now, somethings that I think maybe life changing, but I cant be sure until the time comes and it might be sooner then later. I can elaborate if you guys want, but its a long story. I feel fine in the morning, I feel great in the morning. Im very positive and eager to get things done. It hits me around 3 or 4 pm. Something will trigger it that will cause me to think negative thoughts and it will affect me the rest of the night, but if I had that same thought at like 9 am, I would shrug it off and think, something like It not happening now, so dont worry about it. It has ruined a lot of things for me. Going out with friends is now dreadful. I used to look forward to hanging out with people, but now I would rather stay at home. My sleep schedule is going to bed as early as possible because I cant stand the anxiety. It even stops me from doing chores, I drop everything and want to sleep. It seems like ever since I had the anxiety attack, this has been happening every night. Am I subconsciously worrying about having another panic attack? What can I do to help ease my thoughts. I would love to go out with my friends again without feeling this way. I am seeing a Psychologist and taking meds at the moment. Insurance sucks, so a therapist would cost me 70 and I dont have the money for it and money is probably my biggest anxiety factor.",
    "Birthday tomorrow... Well tomorrow is my birthday. I feel numb. You could hit me and I wouldnt feel it. I usually get all excited and think about how to do my hair and make up, what I want to eat for dinner. I remember all my past birthdays. The past few weeks I have just thought about ending it. Im not going to but I cant stop thinking about it. My life feels worthless. I dont feel like I help anyone. Obviously we cant see too much of our family right now but that wouldnt matter because we dont all get along. My dad re married when I was 14. They had another kid. Same exact birthday as mine although 17 years apart. She is the golden child. They even had a drive by birthday thing for her to sing happy birthday. Im under 26. Dont want to say my exact age. I get Im older and I get the older you get birthdays kinda get less exciting. But I feel like dirt on the ground to people around me. I feel lonely and I feel sad I dont feel excitement. Again its just another day but it feels shitty. Maybe its the memories I miss I dont know. Just wanted to get it off my chest. Im scared to wake up tomorrow. Im scared to have another year like I just had. I dont think I can survive it. I barely survived this one. This isnt a oh I hope Reddit wishes me happy bday for validation post. I just feel like sometimes on here I can share and get it out there. I dont really have an outlet. Thank you for listening.",
    "How does one even find a will to live in this situation? I am completely and utterly lost as to how to justify continuing with my life. I live in a small town, I have no car, and I barely make enough money to afford rent even while working 67 days a week. I have no health insurance and Im falling apart at 25 due to all the health issues I cant afford to deal with or even get them properly diagnosed. My family despises me because Im gay. I dont even care about that anymore, but I have no lifelines to help with anything. My husband lives 12 hours away and its been my goal for 4 years now to get to him, but I cant afford it, and even if I could, I dont have a car to get a job once Im down there. He wont help me even though he makes 70k a year because I dont have the right mindset but I dont understand how my mindset could possibly be any different under the circumstances. I have been through every job in town and several out of town that I couldnt even get to for very long, and the shitty job I have now is the best paying one. I dont have the money or time to go to school, but thats all anyone ever suggests. Im not even at home 12 hours a week, yet Im supposed to somehow get to a community college in another city for 16 hours a week, plus 3040 hours of reading and homework? There literally are not enough hours in a week for that to work, and thats not even accounting for the money I dont have that it would cost me. It doesnt make any sense.

    "I’m not sure if I have depression, please reply, I made posts to other subreddits and no one answered and it’s making me feel even worse Im 16F btw. For many many years Ive been extremely upset with my weight and my looks. I hate everything about me, I could give you all the things I hate about my appearance in a heartbeat. Sometimes when I look in the mirror I think oh I dont look too bad and sometimes I think oh god I cant go out Im so ugly. My weight has become a really bad obsession. I think that because of problems relating to how I see myself I might have gotten and eating disorder? Im not sure because I cant self diagnose. But, I have lost noticeable amount of weight by eating 12 times a day and limiting my calories. And Im not sure if thats extreme dieting or an actual eating disorder. Im scared to go to the extreme and go underweight Im close to being it because I have a deadly disease and could die if Im not eating properly. And Im not too educated on EDs so Im not sure if Im being too dramatic. Back to my depression, I moved during 5th grade and had no friends until high school, people openly avoided me because I kept asking people if I could play with them. This one group of friends made it extremely obvious that they dont want to be near me, which hurt a lot. Lots of boys said behind my back and in my face that Im ugly, horrifying, repulsive, a ugly octopus, sewer rat, etc. That really hurt me back then, still now. And I do believe Im all those things theyve said. Then a miracle happened. I made a friend. She was a cool kid and the time I spent with her was the best Ive ever had with someone besides my family. Then after few months out of no where she acts like I dont exist. She never spoke to me and treated me like a stranger, and it hurt so much it still bothers me. I thought that I did something wrong, that I wasnt good enough, or I was too ugly that she didnt want to be seen with me. Then in high school I finally made friends.",

I feel helpless, unable to reach out to anyone either because they dont care, or they just dont know how to help me and that makes me feel even worse. I feel like my mood naturally pushes them away.

    "In those last days, my suicidal thoughts have strongly come back. Now I've found where my mother hides the knives. I've begun saying goodbye to people The title sums it up. Since an event that took place more than a week ago, on Sunday, Ive realized how messed up I was and how unable I was to socialize and be with people. Ive stopped talking about it to my family, because my father would shout at me again, my mother would joke about it and the others would judge me. Theyve badly educated me and gave me an unhealthy mindset. I hate my education and my familys lifestyle and morals. I despise what how they made me, and they cant listen when I ask for change. Im done being a weight. No matter what my friends say, I cannot see how Im not a burden. Im always bringing down the mood some have stopped talking to me about that and I dont bring anything. Im clingy and pathetic. If you look at my post history, youll see how even school tried to get rid of me because I depressed others. Its the physical manifestation of they would be better without me. Now, Ive stopped talking to people and Im about to end it. I see no other way, no one knows what to do with me. I have the means and Im ready to stop it. Im sorry to everyone who cared about me.",

    "I am having newfound thoughts of suicide My feelings have been getting progressively worse. I have had a complete personality change. I was seeing a therapist but dont feel she is a good fit and i couldnt work with their psychiatrist strict appt schedule. Tomorrow I see a free counselor through my work. Lets talk about today. I made a big mistake opening the wrong patients chart and I said some of that patients allergies. This is a HIPPA violation. Now Im being flagged and face being fired over my mistake. I did verify patient info etc but thats not relevant. If I get fired Im fucking done. I find myself imagining slamming my car into a pole or a tree. Im wondering what I will write to my kids in my suicide note. I just feel like dying. These feelings started recently, usually at night when Im in bed alone. Now Im in a busy doctors office, holed away in an empty exam room and trying to to burst in to tears. I fucking hate everything about my life. Nothing ever gets better. Ive turned into a completely different person. Hyper sexual, I made a separate reddit account to post naked selfies and Ive met up with strange men for unprotected sex. Im do filled with rage. I used to think I was spiraling a drain, but thats not true anymore. This isnt all over this one mistake. It seems like everything in my life is one mistake after another. Im in that fucking drain. Im in that drain, and theres no way out but down. I cant pull myself up. Everything else is pushing, pushing, pushing me down and Im drowning. I dont know what to do anymore.

    "Therapist suggested medication - what to expect I have expressed to my therapist that no matter what I do  exercise, keep in shape, work hard  nobody will ever convince me that I am worth anything. nobody. I just see it  I am so fucking worthless and every day I have to make a mental list when i wake up about why is not the day I should kill myself usually fear, or lack of a good method. I explained to her that every time I see my reflection in a window, a mirror, see my photo, etc. I am convinced I have to be removed from society for the good of it and that there has never, ever been a person that was born as worthless as me. That every situation I am ever in I consider myself the most worthless person in the room, and therefor there is no reason to keep living each day. I am all alone and nobody likes me, which is further reinforcement of the idea that I am worthless. After all, what is something that nobody wants? Trash. And what do you do with trash? Discard it. I feel like medicine is giving up. I feel like it is just a mask for my problems. It doesnt MAKE me a person of worth that people will naturally gravitate to my standard for being worthwhile. It would just distract me from the utter despair and sense of desperation that is part of being a person of no value. This is why Im opposed to medication. It doesnt fix the problem. The only way I see out of this problem is to become a highvalue person or to remove myself from the world. I am not sure what to do. Ive never taken any psychotropic medicine before. But I am running out of time to make myself a highvalue person I set a deadline of 3 months. This is because Im 40 and alone and, even though I was married and in a LTR for 12 consecutive years, Ive been alone for 1.5 years now and I consider it a massive personal failure. The inability to attract people is a massive personal failure and a surefire indication of my low worth.",
    "Does anyone else just not want to be alive but isn’t actively suicidal? So Ive just been feeling really depressed in a really long time. I would say last year I was extremely suicidal and I was on the verge of ending my life. But then it got complicated I got help and blah blah... I thought my meds were working after I reached a therapeutic level of 125mg of Zoloft but Im not sure anymore. These overwhelming feelings are coming back. I mean Im not actively suicidal or anything. But then today my sister asked me where I wanted to live in the future, and the first thing that cam to mind is that I didnt want even live. Im just so tired of this perpetual cycle of shit. Its really getting draining. Anyways does anyone else feel this way, dead inside a little I guess. And do you guys think my meds arent working? I was okay until like 4 PM today. I would appreciate your opinion. And Im totally fine so you dont need to message me, please save it for someone in urgent need! I am receiving regular therapy and am well supported",
    "\"I'M WORSE THAN AN AUTOMATED BOT\" My online friend severely suicidal, and Im completely useless to help her. My attempt to use advice from the depressionsuicide talking tips sounds like a hotline script. Any advice is insulting, I know finding a hobby is not going to make her magically want to live. Telling her that I will miss her is just a selfish guilt trip. I find that just listening and asking basic questions doesnt help because I know a depressing response will follow, and it comes off as colduncaring. I have trouble countering the negative thoughts as she will often say, nobody cares about me and thats hard to hear as I care about her, but I do not want to invalidate her thoughts. I once told her that I thought she was amazing, and she just responded that she knows herself better than I do and that she will never feel that way. ___________ What do you want to hear from a friend? I am in an endless loop of telling her that I am here, and that I care.",
    "21 male, in post-relationship, feeling awful. Hello friends, Ive been thinking recently I need to talk about whats going on. I feel like my family members have heard enough of it and they dont really give me the answers or ease that I need. I loved a girl, and she loved me. She had always been dealing with mental health issues. She acted in ways she expected Id want to facilitate the relationship. In more blunt words, she had sex with me because she knew I wanted it even though it wasnt enjoyable for her. When the issue became clear, and the distance between us bolstered, I became restless. It seemed to me she had stopped loving me. I begged her to get help for the issues, but they were so deeply connected to her life that she was hurt that I would suggest the she could overcome them. We eventually broke up. I dont think either of us stopped loving the other. She hates me now, thinks Im some kind of asshole liferuiner. All I ever wanted was for her to be happy. It was trauma and sadness preventing her from being happy, and no matter how hard I tried, I could not help her. That was months ago now. I started to distance myself from it all. But I still have dreams of holding her and telling her I miss her. Yesterday, it came back with a vengeance. I cried and pained, looked at her social media, seeing directed passiveaggressive posts. It was really painful. I shouldnt have done it. So I need support. Should I just be pushing through this and moving on? Some part of me wants to fix it and love her again, but I know that wouldnt be good probably. And I know that if I was back with her, I wouldnt feel the love that I am searching for. It just hurts. I dont know how to feel. I just wish I could forget. Any support and advice would be amazing. Just to know that somebody out there recognizes Im not the bad guy, I wanted her to be happy. But my own needs became my care, and I stopped supporting a person I love because of sex.",

Ive got the scars to prove it, but Im unsure what to do from here. A couple of days ago I told myself that theres more to life than suicide.

    "Cant get motivated to do anything, even shower Im going through my first very difficult breakup after 12 years of marriage to a man who is my best friend and who knows me and I him better than anyone, hes been my other half for so long, and he was my first relationship ever. I am living with my parents while I try to basically start my life over, on my own, and my depression has almost completely engulfed me. There are a lot of days where I can hardly motivate myself to get dressed, let alone shower or other basic tasks. I try to go outside and at least take a walk but even motivating myself into doing that is like pulling teeth. Ive been thinking of making a couple lists for me to check off each morning so I can at least get a routine down. I need to find a job and start being productive so I start feeling better about myself and my situation.",
    "Living with my parents is sucking the life out of me. Hi. F21 here. Ive been suffering from depression for god knows how long. I live in a 3rd world country, so therapy here aint an option if youre not insanely rich, which Im not. My parents split up in very bad terms, but still live together since none of them have any other place to go than this, so you can imagine how it is. Both of them bitch about each other secretly behind each others back a.k.a. with me. Since my older brother leaves for work early and comes home late, my parents have literally no one else to talk to but me. I understand that totally and try to listen to them as best as I can. But they bitch about how the other one suck, what they do bad, how inconsiderate and ridiculous they are, etc. My dad does this more often. Also, I feel like my dad has become incredibly lazy. Hes 60, retired but is in perfect physical shape, in general. I know there are things that he shouldnt do anymore, but he literally wont eat anything during the day if no one else is there to cook. ANYTHING. He wont tidy up, he wont even move from his char if he doesnt have to. Im a college student. I got a ton of papers and things to study lately, since its my second year and I dont always have the time to do things. My mom works until noon and comes back to continue to work. Shes a teacher. Its so hard to literally baby sit my dad when I know hes capable of doing simple things like fucking make lunch. I feel super guilty when my mom comes home and theres no lunch, because I was on zoom all morning and my dad didnt do a thing. The negativity, the complaints, the bad mood every day for almost two years are sucking the life out of me. I Hut the lowest of depression a couple of months ago when I wasnt even able to move from my bed for weeks. I called sick to school, I barely ate anything.",
    "Please help, my girlfriend is depressed, I have no idea what to do. M, Both 14 years old. Ive felt Depression. I remember there was a time where I hated going to sleep because when I was left alone in the dark with my thoughts, all I ever heard them say is how fucking horrible life is and how much I wanted to kk myself, and I would fall asleep every night knowing I would wake up the next day with no motivation or reason to get out of bed. Every day was dull and empty, every second was a living hell. I had no appetite, lost alot of weight, lost the will to live, god I hated everything. Eventually things got better, but to be honest its kinda been happening again. Lifes been pretty good for me, materialistically, I have good friends, my relationships with family are good, I have an amazing girlfriend, its not as bad as it used to be, but I still feel like empty shit at times. But this isnt about me. My girlfriend lives a really hard life, which pains me so much because shes an amazing person and only deserves the best. Tonight was going well, we were in a call, we talked, did some homework, talked more, and then she left the call. Over text she said she wasnt ok and if it was a good time to talk about it, I said of course she can always talk to me. She starts talking about how shes been feeling down lately, how she barely ate today, how she feels empty, and how she cant seem to feel happy at a and oh my god it pains me so much. I tell her Ive been somewhat feeling the same and that Im here for her and I love her.",
    "working with bpd &amp; anxiety hi all, im only 24 this year but i feel like ive hit rockbottom. i graduated 3 years ago with a degree, got a fulltime job soon after and worked for 2 years. i liked my job, but i hated my boss and left without securing a job back in february 2021. i decided to get help for my depression which i only got the courage to just a month ago, although ive been suffering for years. it was then that i got diagnosed with bpd. i just started a new job with a good pay, high stress level, however i feel like its making my depression worse. everyday i wake up with a heavy heart, breakdown and cry few times a day. i feel like i have no more will to live, but idk if its because of the job or its just me...i am torn between wanting to quit my job, or just continue living like this. i feel like if i quit this job, it would be hard to get an opportunity like this again, especially with a good pay. also, if i do quit and take a break, it would leave a big gap in my resume between february to now...which i dont think recruiters will think good of me  i am not sure what i should do...my friends told me to stay in my job but they dont understand how i feel...",
    "Nothing helps. No matter what I do. My depression consists of lack of interest in all of the hobbies I have, disassociation from friends and family and not caring about them, mental fog that causes me to make mistakes at work which Im then yelled at for, fear of death and meaninglessness that takes over me, and feeling worthless and incompetent at life. It doesnt matter that I eat clean, exercise regularly, write my thoughts down, meditate, force myself to practice my hobbies, go to work nearly full time, take classes, keep my car and living space clean, force myself to socialize, or try to be what is generally accepted as a good person. Life is fucking miserable. I cant make sense of anything. If I try to make a point, an argument shuts it down. Then I question my view, change it or adapt it, then argue that point, then it gets shut down. Its as if there is no truth in the world at all and nothing is real. Its so goddamn frustrating it makes me break down. And then I think about how Ill never be like a normal person who can just be themselves and move on with their lives. I feel guilty for everything I do that I cant prove is the right thing. I just want to die all of the time and I even think about it in the middle of working or playing music, even during these intense moments where I should be focused I can only long for death and a cessation to the pain. Im also in physical pain from multiple injuries that are long term and past drug abuse which Im sure fucked my body up. Im too afraid to actually kill myself because I know Ill just go into a void and my go clings onto life selfishly. I probably dont deserve to live though I make sure to tell myself I do. It doesnt help. I just want one thing to make sense in life, but everything is so confusing and Im no good at any of it. Ill start my semesters of college with straight As, keep them till 23rds of the way through, then lose focus and end up with Cs or D and have to retake some classes.",
    "Anyone else feel bad for finding your friends attractive? College student, ever since I got on campus I started being attracted to people a lot more sexually. A few are new friends and Im worried me being interested in them could hinder us growing a proper friendship.

    "Needing Time to Heal But BF doesn’t get it....am I in the wrong? I was involved with a really good, caring man preCovid, long distance. I love him and thought it was going to be permanent one day. We had a good healthy relationship in the past despite being long distance. During Covid, I didnt see him for way over a year. We kept in close contact, daily calls and texts, but my depression took a turn. I started taking different meds and was struggling. I tried to tell him this many times via phone and by text and he would give me tough love type responses such as people have it worse than you or it could be worse or dont worry so much, look how far youve come or things will improve soon with Covid. I felt like he didnt understand and I basically just stopped trying to explain after trying so often and receiving no sort of acknowledgement or empathy from him. I admit I got fed up trying. Then I saw him for the first time in March and it just felt off between us. I was very unwell mentally in my mind, felt like I had a lot going on mentally and I just felt disconnected from him. After the visit, he kept on saying I seemed different and he asked what was going on with me. I ended up telling him again I was struggling with depression, opened up extensively about the details and explained how awful its gotten. I also sent him literature on major depression to try and give him objective info I thought maybe he could learn from. His response was to say I didnt communicate it to him, and then to say he didnt get it over and over. This was irritating but I patiently tried to be fair and hear him out. Then he continued to harp on how he couldnt fix me and he felt bad that he had no way to fix me. I told him I dont wantneed him to fix me, that I have mental illness and he needed to just let me figure it out with my professional medical help, respect that and be patient. So after that, and our weird visit, it felt like he was just making me feel pressure and stress.",
    "Bottling up and i cant anymore In short i was depressed and had social anxiety and generalized anxiety for a couple years. For the last few months i can say finnaly i am no longer depressed or my depression has gotten really better as there are still days when i feel extremly low but those days happen maybe onde or twice in two weeks. My social anxiety is i would say seriously lower as i could not speak to people and now i have almost no trouble approaching a stranger but keeping longer conversation is still a struggle but im working on it i just need practice. The biggest problem was GAD... I spent half of 2018 and whole 2019 in constant worry i felt like that period of my life was one constant panic attack and i seriously worked on myself made peace with some stuff from past and when last panic attack occured couple months ago i just said to myself i cant be like this no more and basicly numbed myself and life was pretty decent for last two months but as it always happens its all starting to come back and i became emotionless and detached.. Life feels too cold and lonley and my anxiety is still there in my mind but i cant express it..i feel like a bottle that is soon going to explode",
    "Hey. I felt so betrayed that the people I loved and trusted the most in the world would do that so I became bitter and made a promise to myself that Id never share my life with them again. I acted out, maybe in an attempt to punish them, to get back at them for not caring. I just let myself go, let my life collapse little by little. Years have passed now and I honestly think Ive never been able to really give up hope that my family would be there for me, as if they would just suddenly drop whatever theyre doing and come to my side, telling me that they care and that well make this right. Now, as much it pains me to acknowledge it, I dont think thats ever going to happen. I just attempted to talk to my mother for the first time in months about my depression and she immediately got up and left the room. I feel like I should be undamaged by this by now, and I want to tell myself Im fine after that, but I feel so alone in this world and stupid for thinking that shed care enough to want to listen. This is all the more crushing because were on a family trip which I did not want to come to initially, but after we got here, I felt things that I hadnt felt for a long time, that I thought Id never feel again. Something made me want to get my life together and do things. So in the process of thinking about what Id like to do after this trip, the events I mentioned happened. I honestly feel very hopeless and my will to live has dwindled close to none. Should I just give up on my seemingly unrealistic dreams and expectations of a loving caring family and move on? It hurts my heart. so much. but seems like the only way to do anything with my life. Do I move on? for what? Myself? It just doesnt seem a good enough reason. I am not a good enough reason for me to continue living life. I dont care about myself enough. A life without love seems bleak, ugly and meaningless. Im thinking of packing my bags and getting on a plane to like canada or australia to start a new life.",

I cant tell anyone about it besides my friend himself, nobody thinks here that online relationship can be real, if its either just friendship or a spark of love. Its too dangerous and too much risk involved. Cant disagree, but I dont think its true in our case. Even though its been a year, were exchanging pictures and we made phone calls and the risk still exists, but its limited, but they dont even want to think about it. And whoever had someone dear to their heart away for long know how much it hurts when you cant even see them smiling in real life or hug them when they need it. Im a failure. No job, no university perspectives, not a lot of money, best friend 1300 miles away. Nobody takes my emotional exhaustion seriously, its not even a valid argument anywhere. Usually even I dont believe it is. I have not the slightest idea what to do with my life. Theres too much pressure on me and I cant take it anymore. I feel like completely giving up.

All I want to do is cry and lay in bed. But I cant shake this feeling my heart is literally throbbing as if I feels how sad I am. My own mother doesnt even like hugging me. She gets annoyed every time I ask for hugs and hug her. She always says you know I love you I just dont like being touched thats genuinely hurts me. Because I love her and she says she loves me but it makes me feel like she doesnt. My love language is physical touch and words of affirmation and I get neither of those. So my heart aches and is deprived of what I think is real love. Is anyone else like this?",

I was beginning to think this was just my personality now but I know deep down I wasnt always this way I was happy before but I dont really know what went wrong.

To me they were always empty words in what Im now thinking was a cry out for help but seeing it through her eyes, why wouldnt she believe me, and why wouldnt this effect her. It would have a terrible effect on me. And about a week ago I said it again, and that was the last straw for her. So here I am, alone. Ive never really had many friends and never reached out to make some because she was my best friend. Ive battled anxiety and depression for a while now but dont know how to cope with what has happened. While I have talked to a psychologist before this girl was the only one who I truly felt free speaking with and has helped me tremendously through the years. My anxiety has a bad effect on my body and Im so scared Im going to throw away my new job that I love, and the great opportunities I have because I just cant bother to get up and go out the door.

I just want to feel happy again and celebrate with her on her special day but I cant and I feel like a shitty person because of it. I cant stop having crying spells today and I dont know why.",
    "I don't have anything, no future and just.. yeah. ampx200B At some point, I grow homeless and then move into with a relative and then kicked out after getting a bunch of money from me. Then I move back in with my grandmother who pretty much hates me or feels like it. Most of my life she told me I never do anything or amount to anything and honestly. ampx200B I began pro wrestling and been in for about 45 years now, but I dont even have that anymore because of my limit of travel. Im unable to drive, and I have anxiety trying to drive on an actual street. I have no reliable ride for it and because of my limitations I will never get far for it. ampx200B The only relationships Ive had is online ones, and each one never led to meeting in real life. Dont get me wrong, I wanted too and tried to get there, but it never does. There always an excuse for each person Ive been with and even recently it has happened. I got no confidence to try a person face to face. But at least with an online relationship, I dont feel as lonely and keeps some depression away. ampx200B So yeah, that my life story and how I became who I am now. I do not have anything to look forward to in the morning, and I curse at myself for now randomly dying in my sleep. I feel like shit and the thoughts of suicidal grows stronger with each day. Make matters worse, it has become easier for me to gain weight and harder to lose weight as I age. So every time I eat, I just feel awful. Im going bald, my vision and my hearing is getting worse. Often told I look like a 40yearold man or something. ampx200B Hell, I cant even work longer than 20 hours, and even then it feels like it pushing it. Every time I work longer than those hours I get so stressed out and my depression grows worse. I could get more hours, but when I do, I feel worse about myself. But because I dont my family looks further down on me. I look down on myself, I feel like this waste of space lazy piece of shit.",
    "Feeling helpless, stuck, and confused Ive tried to explain why doing basic tasks is so hard for me but its hard to explain something to someone who will never get it and just label you as lazy. And whenever I try to explain how I feel, Im having a meltdown and being selfish and you just need your meds right now. It just feels as if my feelings and professionally diagnosed mental illnesses are being brushed off and not taken seriously. Ive had multiple attempts and for a week or so after an attempt, everyone suddenly cares and supports me but then it quickly wears off, and If it was really that bad you wouldve actually killed yourself, or You need to start making a real effort this time. I have no support systems or people I can talk to and the only reason I havent succeeded is because I cant leave my dog. Ive had her since the day she was born and people call her the dog version of me. Were so insanely close people are shocked by how mentally connected we are, and she gets upset when Im not with her. Were two halves of a whole and shes saved my life multiple times so i cant just abandon her like that, I love her with all my heart. So I guess what Im saying is I feel insanely stuck in my situation right now. Im a minor, no job, no license to be able to transport myself to get a job, no support system, no one to talk to who completely understands, no therapy access. I just feel like a hopeless cause because what could someone even do in this situation? My mom constantly gets mad at me for having anxiety attacks and I feel like Im just a burden to her, because shes the one who has to pick up my medications, etc. and she is always yelling at me because she has to take the responsibility of having a kid with a mental illness, and she wont do any research on my illnesses or how to manage a kid dealing with them even though Ive asked her many many times to. I just feel completely alone and helpless, and no where to go, and Im always terrified of asking for help or support because I dont want to be a burden to them as well or seem selfish or Im asking for pity.",
    "Want to lose weight I gained during lockdown, but depression gives me zero motivation I eat more when Im depressed and less when Im anxious.. but Ive literally been in a depressive episode since October 2019, and covid lockdown has definitely made it worse. Ive also been inpatient a few times in the last 6 months and they fed me well. Id like to lose some of the weight I gained which is definitely not helping the depressive episode, but I also dont have the motivation to exercise I just tried to do a YouTube work out and made it like 5 mins, and I struggle with eating a bit so I feel like Im always hungry, especially if Im eating really healthy.

    "I feel myself slipping again Ive been at February vacation away from school this year and I cant help but feel Ive been wasting it. Ive done nothing of note, not even watching a movie or going to the grocery store, the only times Ive left my house are for sports practice which I dread and just despise. I think its been a long time coming but in the past few hours Ive felt myself slipping in again to the pot of despair where Im more irritated, testy, emotional and numb, and moody, and overall a pit in my stomach forms that I have to live through. Theyve happened more and more and for longer durations since I began taking meds and therapy. Any advice at all on how to buffer this dread and flare of depression would be greatly appreciated, I can already feel myself sliding into it and just about all advice is appreciated.",
    "Where to go and how to get diagnosed. For years Ive gone through what I self diagnosed as episodes of depression. They usually last about a month or two of being super down and not having any drive to do anything at all. Im 21 now and it has been this way since 15 years old. When I was 17 I told my mom I was depressed and I told my guidance counselor in high school. Nothing came out of that except they sent me to a doctor to get blood drawn for some reason and I was sent on my way because the counselor said maybe I have a thyroid issue. Terrible counselor and terrible doctor. Never went back. Not blaming my mom either I just think she doesnt really understand what Im saying I feel. Ive talked to her about it a lot and she usually just tries to support me and tell me things will get better or youre just in a rut right now. Which can sometimes piss me off. But she is in no way doubting me or anything like that. She even told me to go see a therapist or doctor. But I dont know where to go or even how. Who do I go see to get a diagnosis? I dont want to be brushed off again. Instead of trying to self analyze my problems and try to treat them my own ways Id like to finally get closure and see if I really am depressed, or something else, or just dramatic.",
    "Questions about taking Wellbutrin XL 150 mg, about 72 hours before I start Still, a destructive and potentially lifethreatening pattern comes up in my life, time and time again, and my psychiatrist, my mother, and others believe that Wellbutrin XL 150 mg may help. The pattern is as follows I feel resentful about people that have intentionally or unintentionally harmed me in the past, I feel anxiety and shame about my finances, inconsistent income that pays well when I do get paid and the cost of living in downtown Toronto, I feel anxiety, guilt, and shame about my partial dependency on my parents and a myriad of other things, I feel anxiety concerning many nuances of operating two businesses while starting a third, I feel anxiety, shame, and guilt concerning my lack of a dating life and sexual anorexiathe unconscious avoidance of dating, so I doubledown on activities related to my businesses, I doubledown on the seemingly beneficial and health activities that I previously mentioned, I work incredibly hard, going past my physical and psychological limits, I soothe myself by doing highvolumes of seemingly good things, I burnout, and then I become depressed, I experience suicidal ideation, and then I engage in selfsoothing by raging, ruminating about my resentments, having sex with socalled high end escorts aka prostitutes, and binge eating processed food. This pattern happens about once or twice per month it takes at least a couple of days to recover from, it is pretty destructive, and nothing that I have done since 2014 has put a permanent stop to it. I meditate every day, and I engage in the activities mentioned above every day, yet I often find myself in the same place. With that said, I have a few specific questions about taking Wellbutrin XL 150 mg, and I am hopeful that someone through Reddit will answer them for me, as the pharmacist that dispensed the Wellbutrin XL 150 mg could not answer some of my questions. 1. Meditating in sensory deprivation chambersfloat chambers for an hour or longer, after taking 0.4 g to 1.2 g of psilocybin psychedelic mushrooms, has been hugely beneficial to me for seven years, sometimes doing so is the only thing that gets me out of burnout.",
    "Does anyone have advice for how to deal with feeling hollow and disconnected from people? So last night me and one of my buddies, who I am very close to, had a discussion on whats been going on in my head. Lately I have been feeling super sad and borderline suicidal because I have been focusing on my childhood and have come to the realization that I had an abusive childhood. My abuse was mostly psychological and verbal, but it still hurt and I can still feel it to this day. Anyways, last night me and my buddy were discussing how my childhood was abusive and how I try to reach out to others particularly women for comfort, because I feel that I was denied affection by my mother while growing up. All through the conversation, it didnt feel like I was connecting with my friend, only my internal emotions and sorrow. It felt like the mini therapy session we were having was doing little. After leaving I felt hollow on the inside. It lasted till about noon this morning. Felt completely worthless and useless. I was wondering if anyone had tips for what to do when feeling hollow and how to better connect to people.",

    "We were engaged. He left me for a 19 year old he has been talking to online for the past 3 months They also called at other times during the day that I never knew about. He also put ghost mode on on Snapchat so I couldnt see when he was there talking to her, and he was always saying it was a glitch I only believed that because Snapchat really is a very glitchy app, but none of the times I asked it was an actual glitch. He admitted everything after. They were flirting, sexting and everything and at the time it was just two months after they started talking. I only found out because a few days after I started getting suspicious, I messaged him asking if she had ever flirted with him. He said yes, and I freaked out. I also found out later on that the moment I sent him that message they were on a call, and he told her so she was pressuring him to tell me the truth. Thats the only reason why he said yes. Then as I saw he wasnt replying to my messages, I called him and obviously interrupted their call. He answered. This was a long call, I told him everything I had been suspicious about and he confirmed every single thing. Then, at night, we called again. Our longest video call ever. 9 hours and 37 minutes straight. Ive been so bad lately that I cant remember everything, but how it went was basically me telling him all my feelings, how I would do everything over and over again to have the same love and happiness feeling as I did when I went there, how I would sacrifice everything how many times I would need to, just to feel that way again. Then also about our dreams of having a family and everything, how he destroyed everything within a few days. Ive seen him cry lots in the past, but nothing like this night. He was bawling his eyes out. The call lasted all night. It ended at around 730am and I slept until 830am. He slept longer than I did. When he woke up, he sent me a long message apologizing, saying how bad he felt and begged for my forgiveness.",
    "I'm not sure how to tell my mother I'm depressed My parents fought and mentioned my problems and blamed one another and it was difficult. For those curious my parents didnt divorce they apologized with each other and made up After I had arrived home from the counsel meeting I had a talk with both my parents. It was funny because my dad asked me if he could see the cts and told me he used to have depression like me and told me he understood. My mom on the other hand was informed by the counselor I was recommended to see a therapist and my mom said, her words teens hitting their puberty stage. The counselor once again pushed the idea of meeting a counselor and had a small heated debate with my mom about it. My mom backed off and said she would meet one and left with me. We got in the car and the first thing my mom mentioned was that I wasnt going to see a therapist. She said a bunch of things about being upset she didnt know I was going through this and thought it was just me being pubescent but ultimately she was telling me she didnt believe in mental issues. She told me I wasnt depressed and that I was just pubescent. Grade 9 and 10 ended relatively smoothly with no self harming just minor break downs and uncontrollable mood swings. Grade 11 came and my previously clean record had relapsed. To this day despite having recently graduated I still unfortunately self harm as a way to cope from unstable emotions. The counselor told me I was depressed and have anxiety and others who listened to my rants and stories have told me similar to what the counselor said. Im not sure what to do seeing I have doubts that I have depression because Im comparing my issues to others and I currently dont understand myself with constant emotional numbness and random attacks of sadness. I wish to seek therapy but cant without my parents approval. My mother still doesnt believe in mental disorders and issues and I cant talk to her about these issues because she will take them as me talking back to her. I cant talk to my dad either because he will end up talking to my mom about it. Should I talk to my mother about my depression, self harm and seek therapy?",

    "What do I do for my partner experiencing an extended server depressive episode? My partner 24M and I have been together for over 6 years. We both finished classes last May. I graduated in August and we moved back to our home state. When the pandemic hit, he had to stay at home for months. Hes dealt with depression to some extent his whole life and grad school had already been pretty tough on him. He hit a major depressive episode around last April that hes been in ever since. He hasnt been able to finish his thesis or find the motivation to get a job. He sees a counselor once a week, has been trying out different medications, and even went to an outpatient program for about a week. Nothing has helped him in any substantial way. He says hes doing a little better, which makes me happy, but he still passes most days on his computer. He can only rarely leave our apartment, no longer gets to do the thing he was studying, which he loved, and constantly feels tired. Hes such a wonderful person who doesnt deserve to be in a place like this. I dont know what to do. Every day it gets harder to watch. We talked about getting a tutor to help him finish his thesis, but every call or email takes days. Progress is so slow and I dont know how much more I can take. Who can I call? What can I do? Help.",

So basically before the winter breakweek ago everything was going great. I went on a friendly date with my crush that went well, my engineering contest was going great my biggest dream is to get into MIT and I am capable and school was fine. Fast forward to a few days ago when it all started going to shit. My crush left for a ski trip and gone cold, dont know if I did something wrong I have Aspergers and Im a typical stereotypical nerd, aka no dating skills, basically I dont pick up on the subtle hints at all or is it just the trip, I cant stop thinking about it and her, its very hard for me to find girls that I would call compatible, basically someone with a deep passion for something that basically defines them. That makes me distracted from my work which stresses me out even more. The contest Im taking part in is also kinda collapsing and Im very worried that Ill loose thousands of hours of CAD work and 500 in my currency 1500 that I invested into the project that I was promised back. Another team posted pictures that made me really anxious because of their complexity compared to the other teams and given their perfect score they might win. And the school part, my homeroom teacher that basically told me that he doesnt give a shit about me or my goals and that my reasons for joining this contest are wrong and that its all my fault that its gone to shit and that Im a tyrant who takes away all the work from my teammates which is totally false because they havent done a thing and basically dont care, anything I proposed I was told to do myself and most of the tasks of the other teammates also partially fell on me, like Hey can you help him with that? It got so bad that I had to get outside help which made my teacher even more mad so he started insulting me straight to my face, as well as behind my back, saying he doesnt want anything to do with me and basically disrespect my entire work and from my schoolmates tell me he is quite proud of it, it got to the point where my parent had to go and talk with the school.",

    "My [23f] boyfriend [24m] has severe depression and I don't know what to do. Help For some context, Ive been dating my boyfriend for a little over a year now. He told me early on that he has severe depression but hes working to get better. I have never personally dealt with mental illness before, at least not as severe as he has. Needless to say, dating someone with severe mental illness is a lot of weight to bear, especially since Ive never dealt with anything like it before. I do love him, but sometimes dating him is exhausting because I never know whether its going to be a good day or a bad day. Maybe hes bipolar, but I dont think hes diagnosed. Ive done everything I can to help him feel better when he has depressive episodes, but sometimes it feels like he doesnt tell me everything so I cant do much to help. When I try to help, he just acts hopeless, like nothing is going to get better. I worry that this will spiral into unhealthy territory maybe it has already. Ive contemplated breaking up with him but I know it would destroy him  perhaps to the point of self harm or worse. What can I do better to help him, or should I break up with him?",
    "In love with my best friend who doesn’t see me like that. So Iv known this guy for over two years now and the moment I met him I started to fall for him. We are both mid 30s and have a real connection. We actually met from a online hook up at the beginning and he ended up staying here for a few nights, but after a week when I asked him for a date he said he wanted to stay friends as that was more important. I still remember how much it broke my heart then when he rejected me, but we hung out nearly every day. He stayed at my place most of the time and we just became really close. We sleep together whenever we stay at each others places, just cuddling. Over the years I have fallen deeper for him and I had already suffered with my own mental health before all this but now I feel so torn. He is literally my one and only friend, Im terrified of having another talk about my feelings with him in case I push him away again. We didnt speak for a few months as he wasnt very understanding that I couldnt stop loving him. I cried every single day when we stopped talking and this was during lockdown last year. It was awful, I think about him all the time and I have a lot of trouble sleeping with my mind just racing. Mostly When Im with him I genuinely feel myself and happy, but then I always wish for more. I dont know what to do, I feel like if i stepped away again from our friendship I wouldnt last. Its not that I want to end my life, but for awhile now I just wish I was dead. He keeps me tethered here, so I dont know do I just hide my feelings and say nothing and hope the friendship works. I would have been a very outgoing, proactive and positive person but I dont feel that anymore. I burst out crying a few times a day about my life, I dont really sleep, I cant really eat which isnt good cause Im already v skinny. Over the past few years Iv lost many friends to suicide so I know how terrible it is, but lately I really find myself understanding why they did it and tbh I dont have the guts to go through with it.",
    "I don't feel original anymore. When I was in high school a few years back, I was one of the highest competitors in my school. I joined the high school band in freshman year and by senior year I became one of the best in my section. My academics were always straight and I exercised daily. Senior year I enlisted in the military and now I believe it was one of my worst decisions in life. Before I went to boot camp I was motivated, a patriot and believed that the elite joined the military. In senior year I never applied for any scholarships and I was offered one but turned it down because I already signed the papers. I thought I set myself up for success. Now I believe I was dead wrong for joining. The only benefit I see so far after a year and a half of service is that Im trying to set myself up financially before I get out and hopefully attend college. It sounds like a plan but I feel no happiness from what I do at all. I convinced myself theres no honor in it anymore, its just another job. I dont exercise by myself anymore. I feel like Im not progressing anywhere in life being in service. Im just a body and if I wasnt here doing what Im doing, thered just be somebody else doing the exact same. Im replaceable. Thats the mindset the military gave me. I look forward to going back home in 6 months for vacation and thats the only thing Ive been looking forward to since Ive been stationed. After that, the only thing I have my eyes on are getting out of service, going home, being closer to my family again. Theres nothing here that satisfies me and I hate it. I feel like Ive tried everything to be happy here but it seems impossible. I wish somebody could help.",

I have suffering from depression for a whole year! It started last year, 2 semesters ago, with it being compounded with ADHD led to an emotional devastation. It had gotten so bad that I would self harm everynight using an absurdly sharp keys to scratch my upper right arm I am a lefty and one night I decided to cut myself three times using scissors. During that semester I would often write I wrote like Da vinci to make it harder for others to read! things about the emotional pain and that I wanted to die. After the semester was over my mom pressured me to get help. I was put on meds. After awhile and an additional medication I felt better, though took awhile to feel better. Fastforward to today, well last night. When I just bursted into tear and cried myself to sleep, and lately I been having passive suicidal thoughts and I sometimes wish that one night that I will go to sleep and not wake up. In addition, to ADHD and depression I also got GAD and I had a panic attack today YAYYAYAYAYYAY!!.

    "I'm not clincally depressed (hasn't be confirmed) but.. I honestly feel like I should die and Im a mistake, before you suggest it, I told my mom. She tried to be supportive but I feel no better, its gone on for long. Since I was 57. Im honestly sick of faking being happy, I dont know what more to do. Why I wouldnt kill myself Im afraid of death, and even if I wasnt, theres nothing I could use. Im probably too young anyways, thats probably why my mom shrugged it off. Why I want to kill myself First off, I have trouble getting to sleep, I hardly wake up in the night, its just hard for me to get asleep. My mom has taken notice of that too. Over tired she calls it. Also, Im super lonely, I have no friends, the only place I have friends is on the internet, but theyre not on much, and when they are, IM the one giving support. I get they have problems too, but I gave up so long ago. Im also so scared of so many things. Falling into the sky, on a wallthe ceiling, that is a big problem for me when I look up in the sky or look up when Im lying down. It just scares me, it doesnt affect my sleeping, but other ascepts. Failure. Nobody likes failure right? Its worse for me. Im scared of failure because I feel if I fail then nobody would like me, they would ignore me more, I would be more alone. I know its not true, I just cant escape that fear. Sorry if this is too long, Ive just been holding this in so long.",
    "Slipping back into a depressive episode, but this time the stress in not very manageable Basically, to sum it up gtmoved from overseas back to the states. Month or so later move to CA with family member, because they said I could have a really good opportunity. Their job fell through, we move back to home state. Ended up moving Moved to a new place with a family member in a different city months later. Covid starts. No job. Family member says I have a few years with them and its okay.

They told me I could share their car its no problem, assuming in a year or so Id be good enough to move out. But now I have 6 months, little work, no car, and I have to be ready to go somewhere. Ive done about 20 or 25 applications and only three got back to me saying no. I feel like the whole reason I was able to stay with my family member was out of obligation and they were lonely. Now since they arent lonely, its now my fault for not working during Covid and being ambitionless  despite pouring time into now whats a contracted job of audio engineering audio is my passion. So now I have less than a year and at the moment months before Im homeless. Im not on my meds anymore, I was on viibryd for a while. Now Im starting to feel like there is an easy way out of this. I feel like my situation isnt my fault, but to my family member they think I deserve this. One thing that annoys me is that we would make a deal in which I can do x and y for my family member and I would get paid weekly for it during Covid . But that always ended up falling through because they quit. Also the fact that the premise of their thoughts was that they are lonely , wont find anyone, so no rush. But now they found someone to settle with, and suddenly im put into this situation.",
    "I'm about to confess to my family how bad my depression really is but i dont know how. I, 27M somewhat purposely fcked my life up. Sorry for my bad English, not a native speaker. I did everything i could to rack up as much debt as possible. Started ignoring all my friends and parts of my family whom i used to be really close with. I stopped taking care of my rented apartment and myself. So basically Im living in a web of lies. All of this was basically to make it easier to kll myself. But i now realized i cant do it because it would destroy my mother, brother and sisters.. i know they love me and would do anything for me to make me feel better. But its easier to lie and say everything is fine and avoid talking about feelings. So now Im stuck... And i have to confess and try to get help but its really hard for me to talk about this because im ashamed and disgusted about myself and i dont know how or where to begin. Does anyone have tips for me?",
    "How did you explain to a medical professional you need more than therapy? I know there is no comparison and each suffering is unique to their own person, but how did you explain in a way you got medical help beyond therapy? I always feel like maybe I dont look at the right places that my depression isnt as serious as it seems in medical advices available and my healthcare have only been asking for me to do therapy when I have had months to years of lethargy stuck in bed passing out due to anxiety memory blanks little motivation little self care from the normal brief thoughts of self harm.

    "Should I publicize my suicide? Long story short, there are people that I think deserve to witness my suicide because they may be a contributing factor to my death. It wouldnt be smart to put their names on my suicide note because you never know who will distribute that note after you die. They may never give it to the person you intended to send a message to. Whenever it would be publicizing it on social media or straight up dming them before you kill yourself, should I tell them? I dont want to get into the specifics of who and why these people need to know because its a long story. I will tell you privately if you ask.",
    "Help with budding relationship Hey all  I am sorry if this isnt what this forum is for. I have depression, but Im doing OK with it for the moment. My issue at the moment is that a guy I was dating also has depression, and after weeks of basically an excellent budding relationship, he ended it saying his anxiety was too much and didnt want to go further as his mindset wasnt in the right place. Honest, but devastating. Its now been a few months, and we have kept in contact, but the communication isnt anything like it was, and although I want to ask him if he is ready to reconnect, I dont want to push him away. ampx200B BUT I also know that with depression, you push people away in an effort to protect yourself, or because you feel like an impostor You dont deserve the loveattentionetc SO. What do I do? If I was giving advice to a friend, Id say just ask him and say If you really arent interested anymore, I get it, but I want to know if there is a chance of reconnecting and seeing what potential is here etc  BUT I know that might be triggering or whatnot. ampx200B Sigh",
    "How do I stop being victimized? sorry for my English, not English speaker A friend asked me to send him a bike by a postal service. I was already with a lot of things in my head, i knew I had to wrap the bike, but couldnt find much cardboard. When I got to the place there was this dude that attended the postal service that i know from the start that just wanted to take advantage of me as people of low lifeclass usually do around here. I already was at a defensive state, and then he invented some extra fee for wrapping the bike. I knew what was going on. I played the fool and as i was too tired to get more cardboard, or wrap it, or have any trouble, i paid that illegal extra fee. But i felt really taken advantage of, and this guy also waved a knife around, so i would get intimidated. I was already intimidated just by being next to this low class douche that could get around with any shit he pulls, and i knew that for him i was just the next victim. funny thing is that i try to not react bad to low class people, so they dont ger offended, but now Im thinking this interaction was already spoiled by this low life thug, as the bad vibe i fell was all his act to take advantage of me. But i think that given all the options I knew everything that was going on, i handled him the fee and this extra fee... But of course now I feel really bad, i hate imagining this dude celebrating that he scammed another dude with this shit. I was afraid that if i did otherwise this low class people would damage the bike or something like that... And the sad thing is that they may do that either way. But at the moment i was also afraid of the bike safety. I felt it was a burden to react and just complain, but now i felt this blame, i felt like a coward that succumb to this low class guy intimidation, and this guy taken advantage of me. When something like this happen i always say next time i dont even care if everything goes to hell. But then this happens i take this solutions but the regretted as i feel as a coward or a fool.",
    "Being alone makes me depressed Im 24 and failing in college which makes me depressed since Im afraid Ill keep being a loser, I have small amount of friends and we rarely talk or hangout, Im single and that also makes me sad and my family rarely talk to me. People always make fun of me by calling me stupid, ugly and virgin, at first I didnt care about it, but since the pandemic I almost never meet anyone, rarely chat or talk to anyone too and it makes me really lonely. Seeing my big brother friends, coworkers and gf come to our house having a good time makes me envious of him, Im already depressed and seeing him having things I dont make me even more depressed and feel like a complete loser, he sometimes jokingly make fun of me for not having a gf and said I will stay a virgin my entire life. I know he was joking and I ruminate what he said and cry. I started not giving a shit about college and left all the classes and exams for 2 semesters, being suicidal and tried several method and failed. Now I feel a bit better after going to therapist and try to fix my college life so I can be something, but every time I remember what he said for being a virgin etc still get in my nerves and makes me slightly depressed, and seeing couples in the street, or seeing my big brother and her gf being romantic makes me really depressed, listening to love music makes me want to cut my ears and shoves tnt on my eardrum. I want to focus on my college but every time I get reminded that Im still single makes me lose motivation on doing anything except hanging myself but I failed before so maybe another method. I bought a gun 2 days ago and thinking of shooting myself on the head but when I tried to point the gun to myself I feel terrified. I dont know what to do and I also hate my self for leaving college for 2 semesters I could have passed this year if I didnt do this stupid shit",

I feel stupid but I just got a wave of depression watching a try not to sing video from the try not to channel, and High School Musical came on. Some backstory, I grew up in a dysfunctional family my brother was stillborn and my parents became so depressed.. we were loved but we never had routine or did any chores so our house was always VERY messy growing up, and gross and in 2008 we u.s. housing crisis hit us hard. I grew up pretty poor, always housed but it was a messy house and we were not great in ways of food or new clothes or entertainment. Thats where hhighschool musical comes in. I did not have cable TV or a DVD player, just a vhs and a couple tapes. Everything something like video gaming nights with the boys memes or this instance of people trying not to sing a song I dont know, I feel like I missed out on so much that everyone else got to experience because they had more money. Or, parents that were better at organizing their money. I dont know how to let go of these feelings for such fuckin mundane shit like not everyone had an Xbox growing up, MOST people didnt, but it feels like everyone around me did. Im just sad idk. I dont want to be sad. The house is still messy and I still feel like Im missing things and cant get them back.",

This pandemic has hit me hard. I live by myself, I lost my job and my relationship. I am a mess. My family all live very far away. I am falling to pieces and every night when I pass out crying I pray I wont ever wake up. The main trouble is my apartment. Its a one bed tiny place to live but its mine and Ive always loved it. The work I had used to take me away a lot and this has always been my sanctuary. However with everything thats happened and the dip in my mental health it is now disgusting. I havent cleaned in months. I havent done laundry. I havent showered or put sheets on my bed. I literally have no clean utensils or dishes or pans. There is baked on food from months ago and actual mold in my cups. I have taken to hiding under my covers because I am so disgusted with myself. I have a therapist who tells me to take baby steps and one job at a time. But I have done nothing. I am on medication but my motivation doesnt seem to be improving. I am at my wits end trying to know what to do, I have been down before but I have never got as bad as this. I guess Im asking for anyone else that knows how this feels, HOW do I get out of it?

    "Tired of Choosing between Bills and Food Hey everyone, I posted this in rfinancialhelp As well but this is also really taking a hit to my sanity.. Im really having a difficult time getting my finances in order. Back in January my fiancée 21F and I 21M moved into our first apartment. Ever since then we have been struggling to get money to save and even pay our bills. We both work full time and both make over minimum wage where we live. Honestly I dont really know how else to say this so Im just going to say it how it is. She comes from a wealthier family and sometimes has trouble with spending habits. This is something that we have both discussed and its something that she agrees is an issue. Right now we are both in debt she used my credit card without my knowledge for a while and also promised she would pay me back whenever she did ask me to use it, which didnt happen, and now I feel really cornered with my finances. Ive been trying to pay the debt off for months but we struggle to even get enough for our monthly bills. Aside from that we dont even have much food either and I dont eat much as a result. Im just really struggling with this right now because I want us to be able to start saving money and be able to afford things and starts saving and investing but with the debt and the money issues we are facing it just feels kind of impossible right now. Any advice is welcome. IMPORTANT NOTE The apartment we live in is well within our budget, we didnt choose to live somewhere really fancy.",
    "I don’t know what’s going on They cant understand what Im going through. Before this covid 19 shit, everyday I go to school I just see everyone in their groups talking and smiling. And I dont know, for 3 months I really havent felt like Ive been a part of a group, man. I dont feel like anyone out there is gonna give me the support. The last relationship I was in, I thought I fell in love with her, and she said she loved me too. But I always fought with her. I realize now that it was just me trying to push her away, because I was scared of her leaving, so I tried to push her away subconsciously because I was scared that she would break my heart and so i just wanted to have an excuse to break it off first before she could have a chance to hurt me. And I kept telling her to leave, but she said that she wasnt gonna go anywhere because I was worth it. And slowly I started feeling at ease. But then we broke up. We had a huge fight about her not putting me first, her best friend getting in the way. I said I would choose my dreams over her, but I also said I didnt want to lose her. And then she said I lost her already. And we broke it off. She said that she would stay. She said she would stay and figure it out. But she didnt. I guess she just couldnt take it anymore. Everyone tells me theyre going to be there for me, but when I need them the most they arent there. Its hard for me to trust. Sophomore year, second semester, I lost faith in everyone. My best friends left me. I felt so alone. I hovered around different friend groups but I still felt alone. I was bedridden for a time. I think I buried it deep down , because I dont remember much about that year except how I had the worst season in soccer of my life and that I wanted to die. I didnt see a reason for living, and I hated everyone. And then that summer I got my shit together, started training for soccer,and I thought I healed.",
    "Hi, Im fighting my way out of my depression but it is hard. Need tips on how to motivate myself again. And am learning new things with online courses and reading books that help give me meaning like Aristotle, Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus and Neitzche which helps give me purpose. But i struggle to motivate myself to take the extra step to get myself together and move forward with my life, Looking at job websites and stuff makes anxiety just make me freeze, or do anything i can to distract myself. Though i am fighting my depressive state, i cant help but feel apathetic about the world and about myself in it. I struggle to motivate myself because i struggle to see the point to. I have no real motivation to improve myself learn to drivecodetravel more i only seem to take interesting but impractical courses that have no physical use like the ancient history of food. But i feel this is just a distraction to . Apathy just feels like a slow death, and i know that the decisions i make now will shape the person i become in the future. When i try to motivate myself to learn these kinds of things, it is for material reasons, which dont appeal to me. I dont have any real motivations or dreams anymore that require me to learn them On selfreflection, a lot of these feelings of apathy come from two key problems in my life 1. Lack of and seeming inability to maintain meaningful relationships that sustain meit can be days between which i get a text. It is my fault, but i seem incapable of change no matter how much i try. 2. Lack of purpose or community, there is little in this world that sustains me spiritually, and a lot of the world seems shallow and just full of suffering. I struggle to connect with a world that seems so indifferent. Sorry if any of this comes across as whiny or selfpitying, that is not my intention. I could just use some tips and pointers from fellow people going through this on how they motivate themselves to build better lives for themselves. As I hate feeling this consistent nothingness and want to fight to lead a life that i can be proud of. Thank you for reading through my diatribe.",

Depression affects everyone differently and My depression Isnt the type where I have negative thinking or suicidal that I can get over with therapy my depression is basically severe anhedonia and fatigue Nothing absolutely nothing I can enjoy foods doesnt taste good girls dont make me feel horny orgasms are numb dog doesnt make me feel happy friendship and exercise doesnt help me a bit. So theres nothing to fight its just that the reward centers in my brain for some reason decided to turn off and no matter what I do I cant get them to turn back on again. And please please dont suggest working on the root cause Im not depressed because I dropped my ice cream or because the teacher yelled at me Im depressed because I have fcked up genetics and Im trying to cure it. I fking tried everything I tried therapy I tried Cognitive Behavioral Therapy I tried every antidepressant SSRI SNRI Tricyclic Wellbutrin Mirtazapine Atypical antipsychotics they helped minor symptoms like concentrationfatigueinsomnia but did absolutely nothing for my anhedonia.

I feel like Im not even the main character of my life anymore, Im not even sure if I ever was, I feel like Im just a background character, I feel like Im stuck on froze and I cant move an inch.

The internet often gave me that impression. I think Im weak, I definitely do, but I dont know how much. I dont know if poeple are just agressive pretentious entitled assholes that think their opinions make them somehiw better than everyone or Im just being too sensitive and itd just the way poeple state their opinion, I dont know.

    "What would you do in my position? Im a pretty young boy still trying to develop my character. Im in high school. I like to think Im more mature than other people my age. Before I go into why Im so unsure about something, Im just going to give you some background story if you care to read it. Background In elementary school I was verbally abused by racism and many other factors. I was always picked on for some unknown reason. I like to think I was a very optimistic kid. However, those years was a turning point into how I ended up. I took this bullying pretty hard. I lived in fear the following year. I didnt tell anyone about how I felt. I remember crying almost daily. 2 years after the bullying crisis I started to feel like I healed. I thought I made true friends that year which end up being really bad. I was ignored by that person for who knows what. I started to hang out with girls more as friends. I felt they were more understanding. I think it affected how I act because I remember changing my personality 3 times. People started to tell me that I act like a girl. Even my own parents. So I changed myself again. I became more and more less optimistic. I became more dry and alone. That following year, those friends I made who were the girls was a mess. I was a mess. I was so much in pain I did so many stupid things. I dont even want to talk about those moments. I felt targeted by that friend and victimized. I was in fear that year too. At that moment I accepted that it was better for me to not have friends or anyone to care for me. I made this conclusion because my parents werent all that understanding either. I tried telling them how I feel multiple times, but they give me the answer that hurts even more. There are people having it worse than you which I agree. But I dont think thats the main issue. I think the part they should see is how their issue effects that person. Youre crying over a girlIm relating to that one year I was victimized.",
    "how to explain my mental health situation to my professors Ive recently been going through a really tough window of depression. I can barely do any of my schoolwork no matter how hard I try. I am slipping off the ball. Ive forgotten several assignments and Im going to have to submit them late when I finish them. A few of my professors have even emailed me to ask where my work is I go to a small university with small class sizes. I also feel awful because it isnt like Ive submitted everything on time before this. Ive submitted things late before, earlier on this semester. And at those times I always simply apologized for being late but I never offered any real explanations. I dont think I can do that anymore though, since Im now a repeat offender and my profs probably all think Im extremely lazy and disorganized they wouldnt be entirely wrong. I feel like I owe them an explanation and I really want to be forgiven for this. But I dont know what I can say. The truth is that I know exactly how much work I have to do and I know that I should be doing it, but I just cant make myself to 95 of it. I just feel pathetic. What can I say to them to explain this? I dont know how to be vulnerable and risk getting no understanding by telling them the truth. I mean how unprofessional is it to say Im sorry I didnt submit the assignment. I spent the last week in bed trying not to die. But I also dont want to make up some BS excuses either...

According to her, her depression stems from being bullied back in school and being unhappy about her weight. She hates herself intensely and has a hard time trusting anyone. Sometimes I encourage her to do things that could improve her life, like working out or looking for a job, but she tells me that it is impossible to feel motivated to do it due to depression. Shes also made many attempts to kill herself. Every few weeks, she gets into a suicidal state again. And the part that makes it the hardest to help her is that, she has tried therapy many times and it didnt work.

Loving parents, amazing spouse, Good inlaws, good paying job, nice new home, stable friends, and no major health problems. But I just sit here and writhe in emotional pain, I feel like driving my truck into a concrete barrier. Im an adult. What could I possibly be sad about? I tell people around me I dont feel right, like how Im abnormally stressed, anxious, or sad. Everyone dismisses me. Not a rude way but, in a manner like hey man we all feel that way sometimes. My loved ones around me feels so needy, like if I were to hand off an ounce of my pain it would shatter them. I sit here and smile, do my best to join in on the conversation and not draw undue attention to myself. My day to day job is being a Doctor, I get to help people and it makes me feel like I have purpose. But its not enough. I try to save money, not spend too much on myself, donate to others. But its not enough. I try to enjoy little hobbies, get outside, play with my dog, spend time with my friends. But its not enough. I still feel sad. I reach out on forums for depression and ask do I have a problem? Is it normal to feel this way? And not even the masses have comments for me. I dont want to commit suicide because I would feel too responsible for the pain and mess I left behind. But if I was told tomorrow is my last day, I dont think I would fight it much.

They didnt exactly clarify what this meant, so I was like ah ok im fine and went back to my normal routine of basically never brushing my teeth because I can barely even get out of bed to pee. I ended up looking up what the pocket of 4 with bleeding meant a week later and it said gum disease and bone loss, so obviously now Im spiraling about all of my teeth falling out and having to get either numerous implants or dentures in my 20s... The point is, I do need to not only maintain my oral hygeine, but at the moment I need to actively improve it before I get too far. Anxiety will push me along for now, but I know that soon I will start to feel like my gums have recovered enough even if they havent, or just forget why Im anxious, and Ill stop brushing. Do you have recommendations for how to actually get myself into a habit to brush and floss my teeth not just chew some xylitol gum or keep mouthwash by your bed and spit it into a water bottle? Thanks",
    "r/Suicidewatch didn't really give me what I needed, so I'm sharing my feelings on this subreddit My English teacher had noticed that Im no longer turning in assignments and scolded me in front of the class by saying, Whats wrong with you?! Youve changed Ive lost all hope in life. Ive dropped my AP classes for Honors ones, even though I had mainly As in them. I havent even studied for the one AP class I do have, and I only have it since Im in an academic program that I cant get out of. The friends that I do have barely talk or text me, and I have to text them if I want to talk to them. My friends give dead replies like yeah or are just shy or something, but I can never have a convo with them. The friends that I used to have made me feel so alone. My dad invalidated my feelings. Ive been drowning and screaming for help, yet no one has helped. I caught on to my depression so early that it actually had a chance of being cured if I had gotten immediate help. I did not, and now I feel like dying will make the world a better place for everyone around me. Ill no longer have to make eye contact with old friends, or be a burden to my dad. Ill no longer have to worry about feeling lonely or having one sided conversations anymore. Ill be happier. I dont want to live for anyone, since that is selfish to the person who asks me to live for them, their happiness. I cant picture a future life for me anymore. I tried telling my old friend about my depression, and she said stuff along the lines of I can relate though I dont have depression. Im aware that shes trying to connect with me since she doesnt know what to say, but it makes me feel invalidated, like my feelings are just your normal sadness. Ive called the suicide hotline four times, but all they do is repeat what I say and add makes you feel upset, doesnt it? Personally, Id prefer if someone could add some advice or comment as opposed to that, since it felt unhelpful.",
    "Do I need to tell my boyfriend about my past mental issues? Me and my boyfriend are 20, both graduated from HS. He does know that I had depression and anxiety in the past but Ive never told him any details or how I feel now. I do feel much better than before but have been struggling a bit recently. Back in HS right before I met him I tried to overdose, I also used to starve myself. I dont starve myself anymore and feel more confident with my body, and I would never try to overdose or anything like that again. I did used to self harm but he already knows that. Do I need to tell him about me starving myself and trying to end things when those things are no longer an issue? Weve been together 2 years already. Its not that I dont trust him, because I do, I just dont want to worry him for no reason and its just hard to talk about.",

    "my “celeb obsession “ has triggered my depression&amp; I know it’s pathetic but I need some support. I feel like a loser writing this but I need help. I am 28 F which makes it more embarrassing. Ive never had celebrity crushes until I was first diagnosed with clinical depression and I went into a rabbit hole. Ive always had this old soul thing, where Ive always had nostalgia for past decades, not only the aesthetic but thinking my life would be better in a different decade  especially seeing the world with Covid  I also deleted my social media 1 year ago Bc how bad it affect my mental state and only came on Reddit to get support.

I was doing well mentally until I had to see my abuser which is one of my family members by accident by walking into a family event and not knowing they would be there. Fast forward to now I am 28F. I went to a concert. It was a 80s rock band. Being a rock and roll super fan I love as excited to see this band. They were amazing live amp Ive always had a crush on the young version of the guitarist. Ive read his books and watched his interviews in the past. after the concert I found a way to stalk his Instagram amp watch all his old interviews amp old performances. Triggering my obsession. Ive spent days watching it but realized its ruining me and the young version of him doesnt even exist. Hes old and ugly now. I just became obsessed with the thought that if I was alive in the 80s I could of dated Him and be apart of the exciting life of rock n roll. I realized Im just seeking excitement and validation and nostalgia. I also feel I will never be in a relationship due to my past abuse. Knows this sounds pathetic but Im here seeking support",

    "A bit of a strange case: Exercise has DESTROYED my mental health. Thoughts? Advice? First, some basic health data about myself Age16 SexMale Height 510 WeightAround 142145 pounds Ever since the summer of 2019, exercise has been a huge part of my life. My main fitness goal was gaining muscle, so I was doing strength training with weights around three to four times a week. But I also wanted to be able to eat a lot of food and generally have a relaxed diet at the same time. A big reason for that was because my sister had recently recovered from severe anorexia, so my father thought that it would be wise for me to not trigger her and potentially provoke a relapse by following a restrictive dietby restrictive I mean eliminating junk food, soft drinks, etc. Because of this, I started doing a lot of cardio, and I really mean a lot. I started out with around 30 minutes of running every other day, but I gradually added more cardio over time. My peak was during the summer of 2020, when I was doing around 2 and a half hours of cardio every other day, in addition to 10 minutes of HIIT on my strength training days. When school started, I cut the duration down to the following routine alternating between 1 hour of strength training plus 35 minutes of cardio and 95 minutes of cardio every other day. Then, in January 2021, I got a severe knee injury from doing calf raises. Little did I know the day that I injured myself that, from that point on I would descend into the darkest, most hellish part of my 16 years on this Earth. You have to understand that Id made exercise an essential part of my life. If I didnt complete my exercise, I would fall into a pretty bad mood, sometimes for the rest of the day. So when I injured my knee, I was extremely disappointed. Every form of cardio which Id been doing and enjoyedbiking and running was off the table. Judging from prior experience, swimming was also not an option, because I found itand still do super boring and torturous. My last cardio option was the rowing machine. I replaced my bikingrunning with rowing. The problem was that I HATED rowing, even. more than I hated swimming.",
    "I don’t feel comfortable being sad around my partner Ive been diagnosed with MDD just about a year ago. Ive had ups and downs and just really low points. The only person I feel is really there for me is my mom, and even she doesnt seem to want to try and understand my depression. My girlfriend tries to be there for me, but shes expressed to me that my crying and sad behaviors make her uncomfortable and upset. I can understand how she feels about it, but its gotten to the point where she just ignores me when Im sad. I dont even feel like I can cry to her and tell her how Im feeling without ending up just leaving the room because Im afraid Ill make her uncomfortable or that shes get upset at me for just being sad. Is this a bad sign? Should I ask her about this more? Is it wrong for me to feel upset about this?",
    "How do I let go of my anxiety over dying? It is all I can think about for the last 3 years. During this time, I have shut out my family and cut off all of my friends because I dont see the point in making meaningful connections.

    "Goal in life: not to feel suicidal Im a pretty solitary person. I rarely talk to anyone on or off this internet. I think Im happy with this. Ive tried the normal life for a couple years and have reverted back to my introverted, solitary ways regardless. Ive rarely felt happy or enjoy many things. Most of the time Im fairly blah. Im perfectly fine with this and I usually am pretty bored unless Im working on class work university engineering student so I am not bored often lol. I find most things boring, even video games most of the time which Im sad about bc I loved games growing up. ampx200B All of this, Im fine with but one thing. Thats feeling like I dont want to live anymore. It happens occasionally when Im stressed out or extremely frustrated. Its pretty much always bc of all of the schoolwork I have to do or an upcoming exam. My life is completely consumed by schoolwork which would be fine if I were comfortable in it, but Im constantly behind or dont understand stuff. So that just frustrates me more. The last time I wanted to die was about an hour ago. I was frustrated at having spent my 13th hour non consecutive on a homework assignment. I wasted two hours of my life sulking and looking up various ways to kill myself. Finally found one that doesnt make me scared. Its the one where you put a bag over your head but pass out from innocuous gasses like helium. ampx200B So what are some ways youve found to counteract these random depressions. Im a very pessimistic person so when people say enjoy the flowers or life is so awesome, I think thats really dumb in my opinion. That logic doesnt work for me",
    "jumbled mess/rant? (story + requesting advice idk) I want to see a doctor to get it clear if I have mild depression or something else. However I find it difficult to do so because I dont know how much it would cost as Im not financially stable and the culture and country I live in does not see depression well. I overthink everything. I think thats a main reason why I selfdeprecate. Because of that my selfesteem has dropped over the years that I feel I cant do anything good. I am rethinking my choice of study whether it was a good decision. I dont think I am fit to become a childcare teacher. I understand that the principal and mentor are trying to help my future but negative thoughts just keep entering my mind. I should probably go study something different in university... its hard to imagine teaching children anymore. Ive cut down on using instagram because I know it wont do me any good seeing how others live their lives. Sometimes it just triggers my overthinking whenever I see their posts. Ive been told I think too much, that I think for awhile before I reply when this person just wants to hear my honest answer. I think it kind of frustratessaddens her because she wants me to vocalise my thoughts and feelings instead of bottling up, but I still do. She says shes a call or text away but it is so difficult to contact her first because I dont want to bother her with my problems. Well I guess Ill just share these.

    "I feel my life is worthless, I'm ready to end it all, please help me. I've posted for help, and I don't know where to turn to now. I feel more depressed now than ever before in my life. Bills were piling up, and even after long hard days in the office my wife would yell, and cuss at me for wanting to smoke a pack of marlboros, and drink some budweiser in peace in my living room, in the house I pay for like I always would but for some stupid ass reason she flipped on me. She began blue balling me since then, she stopped wanting to have fun in bed, time, and time again I would go to her, try to get it on like I had done before, and I just got no love from her, she acted like a cold hearted pasty white bitch, and not just when I was looking to get it on with her. But this pattern, this taboo purgatory I now found myself in, it was nothing temporary it became a new acceptance, a new reality, a new sign of defeat for me. Not only did I now have to put up with a shitty job, in a small home, where I couldnt even relax in peace like I used to, but now my wife was cutting me off from the little bit of pleasure I found being with her. I had dedicated nothing but my whole life, finances, everything I had to our family, and now this is the thanks I got. She would tell me to go, and play, and spend time with the kids like I hadnt, when she knew damn well I was exhausted after work at night times. So I decided from then on I had to do something about this set of unfortunate circumstances I now faced. Inspired to go have some fun, and have finally a release I well deserved after work I began instead of going straight back to my prison of a home, I instead decided to go out to bars, nightclubs, telling my wife when she texted about where I was, that I was just burning the midnight oil, working hard filing paperwork, just making up job crap she wouldnt even look into anyways. At those clubs I had the time of my life. It became like an addiction to me.",

That made me feel better for a little while, but I cant help feeling a little resentful as I swallow the pills. Why cant I just reason my way through the sadness? Why cant I just see the hope through the pit of despair? Why cant having it all fill the huge gaping hole? Why do I have to let myself hit the bottom before I can decide I need to stick to the plan? Why with forums like this and such a greater openness about mental health do I still feel so alone? Nothings seems worth it. I cant even bring myself to cry about it. That seems worthless too. Its getting harder to fake it and push through. Being an adult only makes me want to run and hide more. Theres always so much to do, but I cant anymore.

If its something im anxious about or i dont like it, or just dont know what to do, i immediately have a graphic imagethought of me killing or seriously injuring myself. These images are usually of me stabbing myself in the heart with a dagger, banging my head against a walltable to find that a knife was there cut to me stuck hanging on the wall by my head, me hurling myself off a bridge, my fingernails being ripped off, me in a boat or plane propeller, turning my car immediately on the freeway...

    "What would you do in my position? Youre crying over a girlIm relating to that one year I was victimized. It didnt help that my brother is also illogical and not as mature as me. Hes younger than me but I was more matured than he was when I was his age. But everybody is different. Thats was me trying to say everything in short terms. And here I am present day. Quarantine made me feel more alone than anything. I thought I was used to dealing things on my own. These experiences that Ive faced really made me think that theres no one that understands me. I do these small things that no one does and I have a valid reason for why I chose to do it, but no one understands what Im saying. I feel extremely excluded. Even to my own sexuality. Everyday I feel different. I feel so unnatural. Im thinking its because I became unsure of who I am as a person because I changed myself so much. To make others more satisfied with me. I wanted to not be lonely. But changing myself made it worse. Death threats were made, insults about my physical appearance were made everyday, and I had no one to talk about it to. I envisioned my life being so happy 1 night. I had a friend who was caring and really nice. He was a true friend. I think what Im trying to say here is that I feel so unloved and excluded. I feel that no one cared about how I felt. I had no one to talk to my feelings to so I became more irritated over little things. And no one in my life bothered to understand why. They thought I had lowtemper. Which is not true. Its really hard to explain all of these mix emotions I have in me. I remember my mom told me that I rely on others and not my parents. I could never tell them that I tried many times before that which came to no avail. Im not diagnosed either. I always lie on those doctor depression paper thing because my dad watches me fill those out which raises my anxiety levels. Also a side note Im a person who is fearful.",
    "Need help figuring out alternative reasons why I'm experiencing excessive sleep, extreme tiredness, low energy, no motivation but stable mood More recently  Started taking 50 mg Zoloft sertraline while weening off of Viibryd vilazodone in midApril. Have been taking lamictal lamotrigine almost as long as Ive taking medication for depression  Ive been wanting to get off of it for years but I either havent been consistently stable enough or it was not a good time due to school or work  finally started tapering off today To the point Throughout the past month, aforementioned symptoms have been worsening excessive sleep, extreme tiredness, low energy, no motivation. No matter the amount of sleep I get 4hrs, 6hrs, 8hrs, 10hrs, 20hrs I feel overwhelmingly exhausted when I wake up. Any energy or motivation I have seems erratic and is dwindling. Motivation is very upanddown but progressively more down. My depression has always been heavily tied to excessive sleep and lethargy. These symptoms are definitely nothing new to me, HOWEVER, its always been accompanied by very low moods. At this time my mood is decently stable and thats the baffling pay. I wouldnt say Im the happiest Ive ever been but Im stable. Instinctively I assumed it was a med problem since my symptoms are indicative but my Dr isnt entirely convinced thats the case since my mood is stable. She didnt up my Zoloft but we finally decided to taper off lamotrigine. She doesnt really know whats causing the excessive sleep and exhaustion. She mentioned that its possible the Vyvanse is negatively contributing even though its pretty much the only reason I can stay awake all day. She suggested there might be something else medically wrong. As luck would have it, I see my primary Dr tomorrow for my yearly exam so she told me to bring it up. Ive had my thyroid tested twice, the last time was a year ago and that checked out fine both times. I dont recall getting treated for anemia ever so maybe its that? Any other ideas? Id like to get a better idea before I go to the Dr.",

I wasnt kept up every night thinking or doing trash habits. But suddenly i crashed and felt trapped, pessimistic, and done all over again. Maybe its part of the process, but its still going and I cant find my groove back from that week. I feel really alone since I dont want to bother people around me and the ones I trust have a lot on their hands rn so its kinda bad timing all around. Over the past few years its gotten bad and started to impact my health id pass out a lot, have panic attacks, all the jazz. I just got put on antidepressants for the migraines and all. But Im sure it isnt that since the pills shouldnt start working yet it hasnt even been a week. Im kinda on the edge of just dropping college and just not trying anymore bc its so hard to keep up my grades with all this.

Its almost like anxiety, but its more emptiness. Nothing changes the feeling besides going to sleep and waking up the next day with distractions like a todo list or a new set of tasks for the new day.

    "People say I'm a hateful person, how do I get rid of that characteristic? Especially family members. And I agree. I can talk for hours about people or things that I cant stand. The worst part about being like that, is that its devouring you from the inside. The hate gets real!! I start to think positively about people now, I tell myself how well they are doing and that they deserve it, instead of being jealous and hateful. I hope this works, and Ive been doing this for months now, sadly I relapsed because I was talking with someone who kind of has the same problems as I do, but instead of keeping our hateful conversation for himself, he snitched on me by telling my sibling your brother is such a good friend, we understand each other so well simply by how similar we talk crap about other people. I got got confronted for that and to be honest? I think its good that this person snitched on me, because I clearly deserve some ass whoopin. So..... Im at the bottom again, my whole process was for nothing... I think I have to accept that this is a part of me, being a disgusting hateful piece of shit thats talking crap behind peoples backs, being jealous because I cant get up on myself and rely on the help of others.

    "I’m tired of pushing forward. When my wife came home she seemed concerned but didnt really know how to react. She sort of pushed me away and told me to sleep it off. In the morning I wasnt any better and I didnt have the energy to get out of bed. My wife called my mother to come help and she did a decent job of making me feel better but I felt embarrassed about it. After she left I was disappointed that my wife wouldnt hug and just sit with me and instead just push for me to be back to normal. After this incident I definitely havent been as open about my thoughts because I know she doesnt really care or rather doesnt know what to do. I have noticed that recently when we argue I will have moments where I want to react in self harm. This comes usually around the time when my wife and I go into a the quiet part of our argument when everything has already been said but we havent come to a resolution yet. In both in a state of calm anger. In this time I always want to bang my head against to wall or take a kitchen knife to my arm. In the past I would tell my wife about these thoughts but it came across as me trying to manipulate her by threatening self harm so I know not to bring it up anymore. At this point I feel like Im in a downward spiral. I want to go back to when I put care into myself. When I gave my all every day. Now I feel like an empty shell pretending to live a happy life. By now both my mom and sister know its a facade but I cant admit to it. I was able to power through it and make my wife and son my reason to live, not just an excuse , but a real reason to push forward but now I feel like Ive lost steam. What can I do to help myself? I know I have to be there for my wife and son but I feel myself slipping.",

I regret that so much because I spent most of my time sick because I had no one to take care of me. I continued going there for 2 and a half years? When J was almost miserable thinking it would get better.. i had a close friend there who eventually didnt want to be my friend anymore and I felt so alone away from my family. No one cared about me, why did I stay? Eventually I left of course, but why did I continue to go there for 2.5 years when I wasnt performing well and didnt fit in with people at all? Is this the same reason people stay in abusive relationships? Now, 23 years later, after working and going to community college, Im transferring this fall. I thought I would be able to get a second chance at college but this pandemic happens and my classes are online. I still feel so much abandonment after my friend left me in college.

    "Is it normal for medication to make things worse before getting better? I started a new medication yesterday, Fluoxetine in liquid form to be consumed orally after breakfast, i was drawing as usual but suddenly i got memories of stressful moments of my life, which made me incredibly angry, i reached the desire of screaming and punching stuff, havent break anything thankfully. After 5 practice sketches i decided to call it out for the day, now im in the bed eating junk food out of depression. These things happened before, but this happened in such a unusual way, it normally happens after my ASSHOLE dad pisses me off. But this time it was the memory alone that triggered my anger, i dont know if the secondary effects are meant to happen in just the next day of starting the treatment. I know this isnt the place to ask about medicine but in case this is more in the psychological side then i need a new perspective on the matter.",
    "Everyone ghosting after some time Hey, eh, life is shit. Whenever it goes good, in next few days sth shit happens. Now I dont want to even have good moments, because after them there are 2x more worse. Last few months I lost my job, ended weirdest relationship ever which I still miss, suspicion of stomach cancer. Everything at 21y old. Besides that my parents literally hate me and only few friends stayed with me, rest faded out because I wasnt going to drink vodkaalcohol almost everyday. And the worst part of last monthsyears are new peoole who I meet. Most of them were really cool, always said they will never ghost but after some time they were doing same shit, which fucking hurts when you get to know someone close. Now I feel like fucking shit, being on knees in front of toilet, vomiting blood, not having energy to go out, when few months ago I wanted to start marathon. Only positive side of last months is reducing amount of drugs throwing cigs, max few beers per month etc. And also withdrawing from being addicted to halcion. Now Im also really scared about university, because there wont be online lessons, but normal. And in current state its hard to go up from bed, not talking about living as normal student. Nothing on Earth basically makes me happy now, Im just living because Im too scared to end this? So I just let the life pass. But I will probably not live much longer naturally so.

Other things like academic aspects, going deeper into a topic, studying neuro science or pharmacology esp. neuroscience was a love of mine, I spent a lot of time with it and it was the reason for me starting the bachelor in psychology is almost impossible for me because depression makes me dumb, disabled and very restricted in thinking or making.

    "Questions about taking Wellbutrin XL 150 mg, about 72 hours before I start Meditating in sensory deprivation chambersfloat chambers for an hour or longer, after taking 0.4 g to 1.2 g of psilocybin psychedelic mushrooms, has been hugely beneficial to me for seven years, sometimes doing so is the only thing that gets me out of burnout. Still, there is little to no research on how psilocybin interacts with Wellbutrin XL 150 mg, so what are some of the potential risks of taking psilocybin within the first two weeks of taking Wellbutrin XL 150 mg once a day and after the first two weeks of taking Wellbutrin XL 150 mg once a day? 2.

    "Looking for success stories from adults who have been depressed most of their lives Hey. So, Im 26 years old and really struggling at this moment. Ive struggled since I was probably 4 or 5 at the latest, maybe even earlier than that, due to extreme isolationneglect. I first tried to kill myself when I was about 5 or 6 years old. Ive lived a very lonely life riddled with abuse, poverty, extreme trauma, and negligence. Theres not many bright spots. I have PTSD, depressionanxiety, likely ADHD and who knows what else. I recently stopped medicating with marijuana, which I used for over 10 years. Its brought up a lot of these shitty past feelings and reminded me why I needed to escape. Ive been in therapy with several handfuls of different therapists, tried several medications, and I do all of the usual shit like yoga, daily exercise, good sleepdiet etc. but Im still completely miserable no matter how much I try to put a positive spin on things. Ive given myself until Im 30 years old to feel some sense of normalcy or contentment, or else I am going to end my life, because I cant continue on like this. I feel like that should be more than enough time to see if I have a shot at a decent life or not. Has anyone else been this deep in the hole, and managed to get themselves out for more than just short periods at a time? I know life is full of ups and downs, but Im tired of suffering 360365 days out of the year this might even be being generous. Im really hoping someone out there has a similar background and has made a better life for themselves. Id love to hear about it, in face I kind of need it right now. In case it helps you help me to know this, I feel that I still suffer a lot from loneliness I cant own pets due to rent restrictions and I have trouble making friends despite constant efforts, and I have a lot of anxietypessimism around the state of the world, mostly environmentaleconomical. I think these are the big things holding me back, but theres probably more. Cheers, looking forward to hearing some hopefully positive stories.",
    "Partners psychiatrist invalidates his feelings and even told him to break up with me. My partner was diagnosed with depression as a teen and has been in treatment since. However he has been complaining how his psychiatrist doesnt really care for his feelingsno empathy doesnt let him talk etc. We have been seperated by the border closure since Feb 2020 and obviously this has been so hard on us both. We became stronger as a couple, but mentally exhausted ,appealing for an exemption and being apart from one another. He has been having a hard time these days, with loss of job and being apart, So when he was talking about this to the doctor, the suggestion had been to breakup with me. Clearly my partner is distressed and has not been having a positive experience with her. She also thinks Im with him for visa. I am from a culture where depression is a taboo topic so Im not well informed about it. I have started my research, yet confused and want the best for him. So, is it right for the doctor to do this? Is it normal? Because I feel like its unethical and unprofessional. Every time my partner comes out of it, hes tensed and more unhappy when it should be the opposite. I want to help my partner. I am scared and I dont want anything happening to him and want to make sure I do the best for him. He is the sweetest person and he has never given up, and have always been trying so hard. He deserves the best care possible. Please advice. Also please give me tips on how to support him when the days are bad. Thank you.",

    "Post-divorce depression Hi Im 38 and male. I had a divorce 6 months ago. The divorce was not my choice , but relatively friendly , I dont see the point of staying with someone who doesnt want to be with you. But in a way that made it even worse .. because it just feels like she gave up on our relationship. Since then Ive gotten more and more depressed. Im originally from Costa Rica , but studied and worked in the US where I was very successful . When I was 32 I decided to move back because I wanted to start a family in a place with more permanence and better worklife balance. In order to do that I took a very big paycut and work at a job that isnt really that challenging for me. Everything made sense when I was getting married , but now Im divorced, we didnt have kids  a big part of the breakup despite no medical reason for it , and both of us trying  , and I feel like a professional failure when I compare myself to my friends and family who continued their career path. Im turning 40 in a year and a half and I just feel like I wasted all my 30s. Im having a really hard time planning for the future , I just dont have any goals anymore and feel like I cant get excited for anything . If I think about things objectively I know I have options . I can try to change jobs maybe get a second masters and get a two year work visa to the US or Europe to get back into the workforce . But I have no energy or motivation , maybe Im just afraid of trying and failing again. Part of me just wants to give  up. Dont know what to do , I feel stuck .",

    "Feeling at the end of the line When we got together we swore to work hard so we can give our selfs and our families a better life than the one we knew. As I mentioned I have anger issues and while I was working one day my boss called me to his office just to yell at me about a complain I presented to management about an issue with my laptop, I used to use my personal laptop to work in the office because they couldnt provide one for me and when it broke I asked them for a replacement, apparently this was out of line for them and he just begun insulting me with my colleagues hearing everything in the next room, I almost lost it but kept it together just enough to put myself face to face with him and asking him to repeat everything closing my fist ready to beat the shit out of him, he just stayed silent and I laughed at him and just turned away, a few weeks later I was fired if you think I should have reported him and the company I did but keep in mind this is Bolivia, there is no justice for anyone who doesnt have money so until today I havent been able to get another stable job and we basically just live with the food our families give us and small jobs I got and everything goes to pay the bills, on top of this, about a year and a half into our relationship when we moved in together and a month before getting fired we got a loan from the bank to began a business together and when she was set to go and make a deposit to buy our merchandise her uncle got notice of this and robbed her like a common thief yeah you read that right, so we went into debt with no job and no business, police and family where notified but the scumbag flew the country to Peru as far a we know.",

    "Should I get myself checked in to a psychiatric ward so they can force me to start my antidepressant? I have anti nausea medication, and I can take that while starting. This option has upsides and downsides too. First of all if I ask them for anti anxiety medication Im guaranteed to be seen as a drug seeking patient. They did that before and I dont even have any drug abuse history. Even if I get them I might not have the willpower to start them. I might end up getting an anxiety attack even if I take anti anxiety medication. Okay here is the part where Im talking about stuff I dont really know much about. The anti nausea medication I have is Zofran. From what I understand the reason antidepressants cause nausea is because they increase the levels of serotonin in the brain and the digestive system. As a result of that the increased levels of serotonin agonizes the 5HT3 receptors and this causes nauseavomiting. With repeated use the 5HT3 receptors become downregulateddesensitized and because of that nauseavomiting stops. Now if I were to take Zofran it will prevent me from getting nauseous because it will prevent serotonin from agonizing the 5HT3 receptors, since its a 5HT3 antagonist. But that means it will also prevent 5HT3 receptors from downregulateddesensitized, because they arent being excessively agonized, and when I stop taking Zofran I will become nauseous or I will vomit, and that defeats the whole purpose of taking Zofran. I dont want to take Zofran continuously because it comes with its own side effects. End of the part where Im talking about stuff that I shouldnt be talking about. So now the upsides of the second option. I wont have to deal with the psych ward. Considering the healthcare system in my country, I have good reasons to believe that the care they provide at the ward is not good enough. I wont have to do a lot of explaining to my parents. I wont have to risk abuse and stuff like that. The revolving door syndrome appears to be very prevalent with the mental health facilities in my country.",
    "You Every day I wake up and think of you. I wake up and find myself further and further away from you. The summer mornings feel colder, and no blankets but your jackets could keep me warm. The mornings youd send me a text to check up on me gave me a warmth that no family could fill. The scent of your cologne and the grass beneath us both as I watch you close your eyes, the sun glinting off your hair like copper, and when you smiled. It was like the sunrise after months of night. You. You are the reason I feel. You are the reason the sun rises on the moon. You are the reason pictures start to dance. You are the reason things make sense. Or, were, I guess. I still remember all those times wed lay in the grass listening to songs, songs that I cant listen to anymore, because they remind me too much of you. I remember trying to fall asleep on your shoulder because id only slept five hours that night, again. I remember all the concerned messages from you because you hadnt seen me at breakfast when Id slept in. The times in class when youd just hug me and watch me take things apart, and whisper compliments in my ear. When youd remind me to drink water, again, because I was being an idiot and getting dehydrated. It was... the best I think Ive ever been. Then camp ended, we video called almost every night. I was so happy, but... were you? You started playing games every night, trying to escape everything because I was making you worried, and eventually the worry and pain overtook you and you left. you left. So you do you, Ill live my life, we can ignore each other, pretend the other person doesnt exist, but deep down we both know it wasnt supposed to end like this.",

Ive been in and out of therapy currently out for years, but its never been helpful. Therapists have told me I seem very selfaware, but that Im closed off.

    "Husband triggered depression by sitting on bed with daughter So my father and I have had some innapropriate interactions over the years. Based on this and working in a field that is very aware of the high frequency of sexual abuse, I have tried really hard to raise my daughter with some modesty boundries to help protect her from grooming by predators. She is 14. At this age I have discussed this many times with my husband away from our daughter. He often gets what I would describe as vey chummy with her. Sitting very close, to do things, resting his arm on her leg and his voice changes pitch like he is playfully flirting and will even bat his eyes at her. I have repeatedly told him how uncomfortable it makes me and how the same behavior from my dad has really bothered me all these years and how horable it is to put a kid in a position to have to tell her father to give her space. Also it really triggers my depression. But, I would say the behavior has not stopped in any frequency. I am in a very bad bout of depression now. I started crying and tried to go to bed. But, they were on the bed looking at old photos. I walked out and walked back in to non verbaly hint that something was wrong. My husband acknowledged the look, but went back to what he was doing. I said I had to go to bed, it was very late. My hasband took our daughter and left, but I was so upset, I asked our daughter to please go to bed, it was getting pretty late. I did this because I wanted to talk privately with my husband about the issue. He exploded and says I am just poisoning my daughter against him. No concern about my depression or grooming concerns, just pure anger. He said he talked to his friends and everyone thinks I am trying to turn our daughter against him, based on this event.",

It was another punch to the gut when I received my U5 in the mail, something that stays with your for the rest of your Financial industry career, stating I had been fired for not following attendance policies. Fast forward to 2 months after everything, I was able to get on my partners insurance and pay 500 out of pocked for a psychiatrist. I was put on mood stabilizers and further diagnosed with BPD as well. I had officially run out of handouts from my partner and I had to get a new job back in the industry I despised. I was making 15hr I used to have a salary of about 75K Base and I am miserable. Im not making enough money, and I am terrified to apply for any financial services job that will see my U5 and just move on to the next candidate. Im starting to feel that if I stay at my current jobindustry, i will fall right back into that deep depression. My new job offers amazing insurance and I am able to see a therapist and psychiatrist which I am seeing regularly but I dont know if insurance benefits are a reason to stay at a company if you are absolutely miserable. I just want some advice, guidance. I would love to go back to school or get a certification but Im just getting stabilized financially again and I just cant. I really dont know where to go from here.",

    "I’m gross and I’m letting everyone down So Ill just start with my job. I work at a restaurant. I really do love my work most of the time. And my coworkers and I get along and customers love me. But I have already been written up before for being late and today I overslept more on that later and was gonna show up 2 hours late to my shift when my boss told me not to even bother coming. I dont know whats wrong with me and my sleeping. Im always so tired. Ive gotten my bloodwork done and everything was great there, so I dont know whats wrong with me. I can easily sleep the whole day. I usually sleep around 12 hours a night and it never feels enough. The worst part is getting out of bed. Im also a really gross person. It takes so much effort for me to do dishes, shower, do laundry, heck, even brush my teeth. I am gross. Im getting so many cavities. I cant even walk in my apartment without stepping on things. My parents say that cleaning it is the least I could do for them and I cant even do that! I cant even take care of myself! Im probably going to lose my job! Everything requires so much effort and even when I just start with one thing I get so exhausted from it. Im such a dysfunctional human. I get an email from school Im in culinary school the other day saying that Im very close to reaching my limit of hours missed and that if I miss a few more, I wont be getting a diploma. I always do this. I used to be such a good student. Such a good daughter. And for years Ive just descended into this nasty incapable mess. I dont know how to get out. I dont know how to be a functional member of society. My friends are tired of hearing this. I have very few close friends as a result. I get it. I wouldnt want to be friends with me either.

    "Scared, lazy, anxious, perfectionism and depression, messed up life I got I hate myself every time theres a opportunity to learn something new, here I am hesitating when to start, staring blankly on the screen, then the worst part procrastinating on memes, funny videos, netflix or even house chores. Challenges I hate that, I envy my friends, always ready to take on new challenges, being the best version of their self and then they reap the rewards of taking the risk, the opposite happens when I face new challenges, panic attack, complaining, whining and thinking negative constantly. My friends are earning near six digits yet me is stuggling to get by on my meager income, most of the time thinking I might get fired on every messed up I did on the office. I always wanna learn to code so I may better my chance of earning more or atleast a self fulling hobby, when theres an opportunity or time to learn I always hesitate on starting maybe because Im scared like a kid who is afraid of math. Coding is painful especially the debugging part but it is very fulfilling once everything run. When I was a kid I love to draw but my parents enrolled me on a engineering course focusing on IT, so there goes my hobby slowly getting forgotten. I envy my friends in college who are quite into technical stuff, I do love tinkering but when it comes to tinkering something about school there goes me, avoiding it or procrastinating on studying. I know a bit of coding stuff but Im not that good on analyzing instruction, algorithm, pseudocode etc. I struggled at school but manage to graduate with not so good grades average, just passing. So theres that my opportunity getting hired is not so good but still manage to get a job Im thankful they still havent fired me at the office, even tho Im the dumbest, cringiest, lowest confidence employee, slow on getting instruction and full of typos on my email and bad at presentationreport I wanna conquer my fear but anxiety is messing up with me. Then depression sets in reminding me Im a failure at everything I do, anxiety letting me think Im hated by everyone and everything would go south. I wanna have growth mindset but everytime I try I bury myself deeper into this pit of hopelessness and being pathetic.",
    "How to tell my parents I think I’m depressed? So, Im a 15 year old boy, and I truly believe I am depressed. I have looked at symptoms online and have thought about them and I do have some of them at least I think so,and I at least want to get help and find out if Ive just been sad or truly depressed. However, I dont know how to tell my parents that I think I might be depressed. So, a little backstory. My grades have been slipping this year, and Im working hard to get them back up, but Im worried that if I say something about my feelings now, my mom will think its an excuse for my bad grades which it isnt, i should have been able to keep up with my classes. I also dont think she will believe me. I dont think I can actually convince her to let me get a diagnosis. If any of you guys have ideas on how to tell my parents, Id love to hear. Heres what Ive been thinking of doing sitting them down, telling them Im not joking with what Im about to say, and tell them how Im feeling. But again, I dont think my mom will believe no matter how hard I insist that I want help. So to reiterate, any ideas you guys may have on this are appreciated, and I want to hear your ideas.",
    "I don't know what to do at this point other than end it. Nothing has helped so far. I have no personality or sense of self, either. I live with an overlying sense of guilt that I am at fault and that I deserve to be hurt, or worse. I have no hobbies and no interests, and never have. I do not enjoy anything I do in the slightest. To cope with not feeling anything, I have kinda reckless sex, hurt myself, and binge drink. I also occasionally smoke weed. The way my mom has treated me has ended up with me being diagnosed with borderline personality disorder BPD. After a hospitalization at 15, I was diagnosed with adolescent borderline personality disorder, so I have had it for a while now. Several therapists said I showed all traits by the age of 13 but couldnt diagnose me because of my young age. Anyways, moving on. So firstly, Im living with completely untreated BPD. The nearest specialist is an hour and a half away, and I have really bad insurance. My disability checks were taken away when I turned 18 last year, and my mom gets mad at me when I try to call to ask to fix this. My life is a living hell. I feel nothing at all, but at the same time, I feel everything at once. There is a void that I cant fill no matter how hard I try and Im in agony. Suicide is always on my mind, every hour of every day. I hurt myself often and binge drink to deal with the stress, or occasionally have reckless unsafe sex or smoke pot. When I was first brought to therapy, my therapist and psychiatrist had evaluated me for autism spectrum disorder and ADHD, and tried to refer me to a specialist. My mom screamed in his face that her perfect child could never be autistic. I have never been evaluated again, but have talked to my school counselor. She says Im most likely living with untreated ADHD or autism spectrum disorder, but most MOST likely both at once. My brother, who is emotionally and intellectually disabled, has both of these. So does my dad. Its in my genetics.",
    "Should I keep checking in on a guy I dated for 4 months who disclosed he is depressed? I F28 have been single for 5 years and I know what assholes guys can be. But this boy was something else. Intiative, social, funny but deep down sweet and sensitive. He told me that winter gets to him and after a month he was starting to show signs of not sleeping and e.g. told that he didnt leave the house during the week but to go to supermarket. I started to get worried when he suddenly cancelled our weekend plans, and I said that it would be nice to know if he didnt want to see me anymore. He replied immediately that it wasnt about that and I told him to concact me again when hes feeling better. After a week he contacted me and I decided to give him another change. Then after a month he started to be again disconnected and finally I told him to come meet me and asked whats going on. He said that he has been feeling depressed for few years, but has now seeked for help. He hasnt told anyone else. I needed answers whether we had future together, which was maybe bad, since he had just come out of the depression closet for the first time ever... We decided that we wouldnt continue the dating. We both cried but I was pissed off due to the distant behavior that had been going on without excuses. I have now been texting him once a week. I started to get worried when he was saying that he hasnt really seen friends or doing anything. He still doesnt want to see me, even tho he said that some day he will when hes feeling better. His replies started to get more short and take more time. Now hes not answering every time. I asked if I was bothering him and that I could stop, but he sid that it wasnt about that. I asked if I could send him a text once a week that he would just open. He didnt reply. I have my own anxiety specially since we were dating and dont know whether I should keep texting him or not. There is mixed advice everywhere whether to not give up on a depressed or to give the person space. Sigh.",

    "A cry for help I live with abusive parents. Im 18, but unable to move out because the Covid situation is really bad in my country. Honestly all my hopes of staying alive were latched on to the fact that Id be able to move out by the end of 2020. But things have been so bad, quarantine has given my parents the right to basically keep me under lock and key under the farce of protecting me. Theyve broken the locks to the door of my room, and often my father is physically abusive. Both my parents are emotionally abusive. Every time my father is done beating me up, for months nobody in my family talks to me. Ive suffered from a complete mental breakdown, for a period of time I believed I was dead. I called a child helpline but I chickened out when they said theyd come over to my house to help me out. I talked to my school counsellor and she made me apologise to my parents for disrespecting them enough to call a helpline against them. I genuinely cannot do this anymore. I havent slept at night for weeks on end. Every time I try to sleep, I wake up suddenly and am unable to sleep again. I wrote down a suicide note yesterday. I made a reddit account today because Ive the tiniest bit of hope left. Ive studied so hard all my life just so Id take a Student Loan and move out for a good college, but all of that has fallen through. All my life, one hope sustained me, but now thats gone, Im basically living as a prisoner. I wish even a single person would believe me. It might save my life. Please.

    "What happens when you text a suicide Hotline? Suicidal thoughts are a thing I deal with all the time, especially when I end up feeling low because I have no motivation for anything. My therapists recommend using a Hotline or whatever when it gets really really bad, but I just dont see the point? Im not going to kill myself, its too much effort. And its just thoughts, so it feels kind of silly to text a crises line. So Im curious what actually happens when you use one?",
    "Are my feelings valid if I don't cut, or harm myself? Its so hard to turn away. I know now, it was a very, very abusive situation, which I kept putting myself into it. It wrecked my self esteem, and self worth. Through constant breakups, and fights which I could never win, and eventually relenting to, it puts you on tiptoes, around anything you do or say. Anyhow, after the sadness, came nothing. There wasnt happiness nor love, just nothing. I still cared for people, and loved them, but I discarded all emotions I felt for them when speaking, or trying to talk to someone. Its almost like an offswitch was flipped, I began seeing things from a perspective which wasnt how I was. It wasnt exactly pessimistic per say, just more observant. Being able to read situations not with sympathy, or empathy, more with observation. Now, I guess, I struggle to understand how I feel myself. And this is where the issue comes in. I have known many people to cut and harm themselves. And every time I look at my situation, I cannot help but feel selfish? Im in a comfortable, content position in my life. I dont feel the need to kill, or harm myself. And I feel pitying myself is so selfabsorbed. I believe, if I were to tell anyone how I felt, it wouldnt be valid, itd be brushed off as sadness as I do not have the desire to harm myself. Its hard to truly explain what I mean, and I feel I have made this post much more differentiated from the point I was trying to make. But I truly, believe my feelings are selfish. There is so many people whom are hurting themselves, and Im here feeling sorry for myself, over a reason that is not to exist. Im upset, over feelings that arent real? Im living my every day life normally, whereas so many people cannot do the same. I do not know what to make of what Im feeling, and was hoping someone may be able to help?",

My m27 best friend f24 is a brilliant person with an impressive amount of potential to do anything, to create beauty, be it writing, painting or singing, but she is constantly unmotivated to do anything, shes failing at her job a job I helped her get, shes always oversleeping and sleeping unreasonably late, when she tells me what she feels she says she feels useless, worthless, depressed and incapable to fit the potential I always tell her I see in her. Shes often wondering whats the point of even trying. Im usually texting her and she seems alright, but when i wish her good night and go to sleep she always remains awake for hours while I sleep, and thats when her panic, depression and anxiety invades her, when shes alone, but I cant stay awake with her because I have to work early in the morning. She usually comes to me looking for supportive words and I know I make her feel better, but that effect wears off and I fear I cant be there for her 100 of the time. I want her to be happy even when Im not around, not because I dont want to help her, but because I wont be there forever, and her mental peace shouldnt depend on me. How do I help my best friend? What can I do or say to make her realize how wonderful she is?",
    "I think I may have been struggling with mild depression and anxiety on and off for many years When I was a teenager from maybe 1415 years old onwards I struggled with poor selfesteem, low mood, lack of motivation, procrastination, guilt, insomnia and anxiety about school work, my health and social situations. Back then I did a lot of wallowing and was pretty woe is me. I didnt really have many hobbies or friends and spent a lot of time on the internet. Im 27 now and Ive worked hard to get better at coping with things but I still find myself falling into the same patterns though with a little less melodrama I like to think!. Last year I got CBT for health anxiety and I found that really helpful. This isnt the first time Id spoken to a doctor about my mental health but its the first time Id gotten treatment. What kind of surprised me though was one of the questionnaires I completed indicated I might have mild depression. This wasnt something we discussed and Im left wondering now does that mean its no big deal? I find my job pretty difficult because Im constantly battling feelings of inadequacy, guilt, anxiety, low motivation and procrastination. It feels like I must be the problem as I felt similarly about my previous jobs as well. So Im just hoping there might be something I can do to overcome this? Has anyone dealt with something similar? I know my problems arent that acute or severe but they are persistent and have a cumulatively really detrimental effect on my life.",

I always remember being deeply sad with an overly critical and hateful view of the world around me human kind are doing nothing productive for the earth and it would be best if we walked hand in hand to extinction to save the planet kind of hateful or for some periods of time feeling like Im buzzing with happiness, in which times I felt unstoppable. With my first diagnosis, my first set of meds followed, I trialled quite a few over the years but when I decided they didnt work for me I tried self medicating with anything I could get my hands on and ended up with major substance abuse issues.

I feel as if Im being sucked into a giant pit of despair I cant get myself out of and Its progressively getting harder to leave bed. I get panic attacks before and during leaving the house because Im terrified someones going to hurt me. I only go out to get groceries and even then sometimes I get there, panic and cant leave the car so I just go home. I cant sleep properly anymore due to horrible nightmares. I can never shake the feeling that Im a giant burden to everyone in my life so I cant talk to them about when Im struggling. Ive isolated myself so much over the past few years I dont have a single friend left. Id like to try medication again but Im too terrified to try anything and have panic attacks thinking about taking something to shut up my mind in fear of getting addicted and out of control.

    "Losing myself in tv and phone games Logically I know I need to put my energy towards productive or positive things more and not wreck my brain with hours of passive tv and phone games. Because living here at my parents is dangerous for me. Ive become too comfortable I guess because I dont want to feel anxiety again, and I stay in a really small box. I dont even smile much,make eye contact or spend time with family because my nervous system and brain cant handle the unpredictability of interactions with them, needing to be on the defense so they cant affirm my negative fears about myself and my future. I used to be outgoing and extremely energetic and passionate about life. Then trauma hit and I dont have the energy to afford to spend on things that dont earn me health or money. Not proud but its true and if you can relate then you understand what I mean. If youre financially dependent on other people your very health and future hangs in the balance of other peoples whims and no good things can be trusted until there is income, because every good interaction eventually has a circumstance where someone makes an offer and I cant say no because Im under their thumb. I need a job that requires very little emotional energyfaking happiness, and requires more problem solving or physical labor. I never got proper schooling or job training, worked mostly on organic farms but now I want to pursue income that is compatible with my post trauma body and brain. Im afraid that my world has become so small and limited compared to what it needed to be, and I need to expand it again. I practice yoga, meditate, cook, walk in nature a lot, dropped all unhealthy habits except the tv and phone. Im still not happy and feel terrible to not know what direction I should be devoting all my energy to, to break me out of this sad sad hole asap. TLDR what would you do in my limited position to save yourself from negative coping habits of zoning out with tv and phone games? Im totally fine with moving by the way. I just cant afford it yet",
    "I don't know what to do at this point other than end it. Nothing has helped so far. My mom was some sort of sick twisted bitch or whatever. She ended up in jail pretty often, too. The physical fights stopped after I was born, my dad stopped drinking, and my both parents became law abiding citizens. Occasionally they would throw things at each other, and they still get in screaming matches, but its nothing like it was before I existed. I was born a really gifted kid 157 IQ I know it doesnt matter, really good at everything, scary type of smart, extremely mature for my age. The only thing I wasnt good at and still am not good at, lol was prolonged physical activity. My mom has emotionally abused for my entire life using this fact. She has essentially turned me into a perfectionist and led me to believe that it was my fault, and not hers. She has never accepted anything less than straight As and perfection, but instead of punishing me like a normal kid grounding or no allowance or more chores, she would scream at me until she was blue in the face and occasionally beat or shove or throw me, yelling about how I was a disappointment and a failure to her. She emotionally neglected me as well she never paid attention to me or gave me praise unless I was doing something that she wanted me to do. She knows nothing about me, and loves the image of me she has made. She says I am a waste of money, and makes me feel guilty for needing basic things like food and health care. We are pretty poor, but I think that is overstepping the line. She vicariously lives her life through me because she ruined her life at my age she stayed with my dad and dropped out of college to have me at 22. This is only a summary of the things she does. It would be much worse if I went into detail. Nothing I do makes me feel good enough. I am severely fucked up because of my mom. I have no idea how to maintain healthy relationships, whether it be with friends or romantic partners. I have no self esteem, no self respect, and if Im honest?

But lately, I have noticed that I feel almost like I want to know everything he does and when he does it, and he is part of a group that I recently left, and is, in fact,in a leadership position there. I left for several accumulative reasons, but one of them was because since he was in a leadership position, we where not able to converse at the group. It was hard for both of us, but we tried to follow the rules. After I left, I started having trouble with the nights that the meetings where taking place, like it was hard for me to accept the he was still there and I wasnt. Im also noticing that when we have something planned and he backs out because of, for example, work, I find that I am way more bothered by that than I should be. So, am I a sociopath, and what can I do to stop these tendencies? Thanks in advance. Tim not my real name, of course",
    "Just need to talk to anyone His plans and the way he described it made it sound like today was gonna be the most perfect dateday. On the way back I was just upset and angry with myself and my siblings. I was upset with my siblings because they are all young adult, hell two of them are adults,21 and 19 but one of couldnt stay home for a couple of minute until the rest of my family got home. While we got to my house he didnt even park, he just stop in first we said goodbye and I went inside. I say that because he always parks in the driveway, gets out, and walks me to my front door. He did try calm me down before hand but I was just so angry. My parents were still home and asked me whats wrong and why was I upset. I told them but my mom made feel worse. She made me feel like I should have told her and that it was my fault for not knowing about his surprise for me. My dad tried to tell her that she was wrong and that how was I supposed to know about my fiancés surprise. I was texting and later was in call with my fiancé while that was happening and he was still upset but was telling me that it was not fault. That what happened was unfortunate and upsetting but it wasnt my fault. Everytime I tried to blame myself he would tell me to stop. That yes he was upset and he was sorry for upsetting me. It ended with me and him in a phone trying to make the other person feel better but it didnt work. Now he has gone to bed and Im still awake still upset my eyes burn a little due to crying. I just want to talk, just to clear my mind of bad thoughts. I cant call him because he has work in the morning and I want him to rest. I feel like I need help, Im a mess. I feel like crap my mental state is fucked due feel like my happiness was ripped from me. I just want to start the with a smile and end the day with a smile.",
    "I'm scared about my future I feel like shit. Ive studied for almost 3 years for it and I got rejected. It feels like all the hard work Ive done was in vain. I can try again next year but I dont wanna be a burden for my family, now that I finished highschool I feel like I dont deserve to live with them since I dont contribute with anything in the house. I thought that I can finally change my life but I fail at everything I try. Sorry for this post, I dont have any friends to share this with. I feel scared about the future and alone. Ive never felt so much despair.",
    "How to find motivation to self-improve when happiness is imposible for me? I feel really bad about my life because its bad but I feel like even if I made the massive effort to make my life good I would still feel bad and the only difference is I would no longer have the pie in the sky to console me. I want to change but how can I find the motivation when I feel like happiness is impossible? I made a vlog where I ramble about this as I walk around the street at night in if anyone is interested... httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vpy94rPcmyE4ampt91shttpswww.youtube.comwatch?vpy94rPcmyE4ampt91s",
    "I'm really depressed and I want to get help but I don't know what to do I have always known I was a little depressed, but once the pandemic hit all of the things I did to keep myself normal disappeared and I spiraled out of control. I got dismissed from my school a few months ago because I failed all of my classes for both 2020 semesters and most days dont get out of bed. I have done absolutely nothing productive since getting dismissed because every time I try I get really emotional about the dismissal. I am really scared to go to the dentist because I know I havent been taking care of my teeth. It is a minor miracle if I shower more than once a week. I feel like life is just passing me by, every day I wake up and then blink and Ive spent the past 12 hours in bed and I didnt accomplish anything. All of my friends are extremely accomplished people with jobs or internships lined up and I have literally nothing because I cant get myself to DO anything. Im too ashamed to reach out to them about it, I also just feel like they wouldnt understand or have any helpful advice. I know comparison is the thief of joy but I cannot help it. I dont want to get into the details but I am also trying to process some traumatic things that happened to me in the past few years and some days I have are just dark. I am not suicidal but I do have some intrusive thoughts about suicide occasionally which are starting to become more frequent. I am turning 25 soon and I want to get help before I get kicked off of my parents insurance. But I dont know anything about what to do. Do I get a therapist? Psychiatrist? Or something else? How do I find one and how do I pick the right one? I had a bad experience with a therapist when I was younger which has put me off of this until now  Are there other steps I should be taking? I dont even know what to do, I just know I cant live like this anymore. Asking my parents for help directly about this is also not an option for me, at least not yet, which is also why Im posting here. Thanks for reading.",
    "How do I (14 M) talk to my (Typical Indian) dad about seeing a therapist? Now I dont know if I should believe him or not. Anyways, this was just the backstory and here is whats going on now I want to see a therapist to talk about my problems but there is no therapist where I live. The closest one is like 3 hours away. One of my closest friends lives in Chandigarh Its a big city and I asked him if he could find out about any therapists there. His mom used to be a dentist so she knew some people and one of her close friends is a reputable psychologist in Fortis hospital. He told me about her and I was like Well, so can I call her and talk to her about wtf is going on with me but turns out she needs to talk to my dad first because since Im a minor I cant be diagnosed without parental consent. So this means that I will have to tell my dad that I need to see a therapist. He will ask me why and I will have to tell him about my depression, suicidal thoughts, etc. Keeping in mind how our last convo about my mental health went and our notsogood relationship, can you guys give me some advice about how to talk to him? PS He gets irritated very easily and he rarely listens to me, and even if he does he will say Im wrong since I am younger and that I never listen to him. TLDR I am a 14 yo Indian dude with a typical Indian dad. Our last convo about my mental health went not so wonderful and he told me to kill myself and how to do it, and that he doesnt give a fuck about it. I want to see a therapist for depression, suicidal thoughts, selfharming, etc. but the closest one is 3 hours away. I need parental consent for even basic diagnoses, and I have no idea how to approach my dad about this. We have a poor relationship and havent talked about anything else than studies in the past 3 years or so. Skim through the upper paragraphs because I might have left something out, I tend to do that",
    "Is it all even worth it? It got so bad that I had to get outside help which made my teacher even more mad so he started insulting me straight to my face, as well as behind my back, saying he doesnt want anything to do with me and basically disrespect my entire work and from my schoolmates tell me he is quite proud of it, it got to the point where my parent had to go and talk with the school. I wanted to press charges More fun news came when all of our sponsors pulled out before we could sign a contract with them so we got no money ATM so basically Im getting shit at school invested 10x time than anybody in the project as well as the 1500 that I may not get back, also possibly severe lung issues. And now Im on vacation and I feel helpless since I cant get anything done here and I feel like I dont deserve it and that its not the time for RampR when the project is going critical, I also need this because MIT looks at stuff like that, its a very prestigious and demanding STEM contest. And right now I just feel empty, unloved, alone, anxious, stressed and hopeless, I have to be happy or otherwise my family will be mad at me for ruining the holidays which puts even more pressure on me. I had a similar situation already a few years agochoosing a school where I got close to attempting to take my own life, took me 2 years to recover, I made myself a promise that it would not repeat with MIT and now I feel like it might happen and that I will be left with nothing and alone, just an empty shell devoid of happiness and any hope for tomorrow. Im requesting support but I have no idea what could help me rn.",
    "Why do I have sudden \"bursts\" of depression I know the title probably doesnt make sense but I stopped working for a while to peruse a business idea i had which failed and now Im about to go back into the work force Im only 19 and I have these moments where i just feel lost and like I failed my family and friends as my business is what i dedicated my life to for the past 6 months and most of that time was me sitting in my room trying to get it off the ground floor. Im really nervous about getting a job again as i havent had a real one that entire time am I just overthinking it or will it be not as bad as i think.",

    "Is this a toxic friend I am a shy and private person. Thus as s result i dont have a lot of friends, for a year and half i have been friend with s girl of my sm age i am 19y m. I was really happy to get a friend like her she was supportive and caring but for the past six moths i have noticed that she was not replying to my text , tbh i thought it was fine and thought because of the semester. We are classmates. I have noticed that she only act Friendly when she need to. I thought it was also fine as she may be nervous to ask for favours but for a past month i have noticed that she completely stop texted me just a few days ago she asked about our friendship beyond college. This seems very suspicious. I dont know what have gone wrong. I see her as my friend still. Its okay to break friendship if one party thinks it. The problem lies whenever i ask if she wants to stop me texting she dont reply but actually tries to avoid it. I have now seen it was a weak spot for me. She was my only friend and i am not open to my family. Now because of this my concentration and mental stability is gone i suffer from schizophrenia. I dont know if what happening is real or i am making the stuff up. Anyway despite of knowing everything she is not coming clean. I suspect she dont want me be her friend anymore and its fine, but she is not telling me that because of the help , benifit. I dont know what to do i also cant concentrate on anything i would like to know your advice. As i need a other prospective. tldr how to tell if a friendship is toxic.",
    "My friends left me, whats wrong with me and how do I fix it? Im the one that makes the paragraph, while getting a one word response. My moms told me that I have a obnoxious personality, she doesnt know how she raised me to come out the way I did and that theres no wonder all my friends left me, and that when I go back to school Im not ever going to have any friends. So the basic question Im wondering is just... whats wrong with me? I can never stay happy for more then a few days before I fall into this loop of selfpity remembering all of the memories that we had. I just want to know what to do. I mean obviously I cant get attached to people the way I have been until they prove themselves by actions, but in order to get people to stay, they have to want to stay. So how do I become better? Thanks for reading this whole lifestory but yeah. Thanks.",
    "My GF is suffering with depression and I don't know how to help Ive told her Im here for her but shes very distant now. I dont wanna suffocate her with love amp support cause she said it makes her anxious so do I just let her be distant for a while? She has also brought up every mistake Ive done in our relationship and wanted to break up with me because Im not perfect. Ive dated her for years this isnt the first depressive episode last time I did leave since she was already moving on with someone else. But this time there is no one else we were talking about marriage before she went into this depressive state. Usually it doesnt get this bad like shed feel better in a week or two or shed at least talk to me. This time shes barely talking to me. I want to help her but I dont know how and now Im starting to wonder if shes depressed because of me.",
    "Is this normal? Hi, I dont know if this is the right place for me to ask this but I need answers from those who are in similar situations as I know depression can be tough. I am recently friends with this guy and he was a super nice friend. Along the way, he opened up about being depressed and all. For the past 3 weeks, he suddenly started to cut off our convos short and never made any plans anymore. Each text would end less than 5 mins with him telling me to rest, study or something. But then he came back like everything was fine. We also have a common enemy which he tends to talk about. But as soon as I talk about that person, sometimes he is supportive, but sometimes Ill be hearing remarks like oh, him again? or life happens. I dont think I initiate the talk about the enemy much but I do talk about him time to time when he, himself brings up the topic but then again, sometimes Ill face the same remarks. Am I doing something wrong here? I genuinely felt hurt by his behaviour and I want to know if this is something I should approach him about or it is because of his depression. I would really appreciate if anyone could confirm this for me. Thank you.",
    "I think a friend may have done something bad, what can I do? Hi, Im not really sure where else to go with this, a friend of mine has kinda just disappeared for over a day now and usually when this happens theyre active somewhere still. This time, theyve had no online activity for the entire time, and its honestly got me really worried cause I cant get in contact and they were in a really bad mood the last time I heard from them. Im kinda assuming the worst right now sadly as thats what my brain does  i left so much unsaid and its gonna pain me for the rest of my life if im correct  but what should I do? what can I do? they live like 100 miles away so its not like i can go find them... ampx200B thanks.",

    "I kill myself if you don’t read My upbringing only perpetuated my depression. My single mom never gave me responsibilities and I had too much free time. Making it worse I was a nerd so having the option to just stay inside and play video games was heaven. Years went by without speaking with anyone or trying to build relationships. In my teen years that was basically suicide because who wants to be known as the loner. So I would skip days to keep my fragile ego safe. Thoughts go by in my head that if I could just at the very least get over my fear for rejection I could get my life in order. Because having an intimate relationship would really solve a lot of current issues I have. And so Im actively looking subconsciously and consciously because i am starving for intimacy. I know how that would look desperate maybe a bit crazy. And its not about sex its about completely being open and honest with another person. I feel I can only be this intimate with a girl and refuse to open up to such an extent to the access of other human beings in my life. Because the human being in my life were not driven by choice ie family, childhood friends Im in a pickle and it sucks, but if it wasnt for weed I would not be aware of my issues, stayed positive and attempt to help myself. This is only a recent discovery ever since joe Rogan started talking about how weed paranoias actually help you figure out what is actually stressing you out. Thats the worst about depression, every action you do against yourself feels justified and logical. Its truly a terrible disease and I hope I survive this. Sorry about title Im just so desperate I apologize for my existence.",
    "Help with depression Hello everyone, This is my first time on reddit and my first time posting. I am sure many people face issues that are much worse than mine, but I dont know what to do anymore other than ask for help. English is not my first language so I apologise for any mistakes. For context I am 24 yo, female, with a stable job and a loving boyfriend. By all means I should be happy right? Well I started feeling more and more depressed a few months ago and so far, it hasnt changed. I dont feel like eating and have lost weight, I dont feel like going out or hanging out with people and I could literally spend my whole day sleeping which I did for the past two days, missing work, I often find myself crying for no reason and I dont enjoy anything anymore. My boyfriend is abroad for a while because of his studies, and so I am able to hide from him most of the time. But its getting harder and harder and I think he is starting to lose patience. Our last two conversations was him telling me that he is sick of me moaning every two days and crying for no reason. This is not the first time I have been depressed, and usually it follows something bad, but this time I feel like its all in my head and its Something that I cant get out of. Its starting to impact my job, my Relationship and everything else in my life... Do any of you have any advice for me? ampx200B Thank you for taking the time to read this post!",
    "Inability to care about anything I dont know what it is or how to phrase it properly but I seem to completely unable to care about anything. I could lose my job tomorrow and no matter the consequences I wont care what happens. I could lose all my friends and my mindset will still just be oh well shit happens. Does anyone else get this? I feel I go through the day not bothering or caring about anything at all. Even at my job everyone there knows I just couldnt care less about what happens but I get my job done so people dont seem to bother me about my attitude. Im on antidepressants which could be causing it but when Im off them Im in a constant state of existential dread. I think it might just be a realisation that nothing I do actually matters in the long run since I am eventually going to die and nothing will matter from then on. Does anyone else get like this?",
    "I feel lost I wont bore you with my sob story of a past, it was horrible and has left me a mental mess at the best of times. I was getting better, was motivated to keep going in every aspect of life and wanted to make my future mean more than just getting to the next day alive, and thats exactly what was happening. I had everything ahead of me, but all that has changed and disappeared. Im a 20 year old whos still living with their parents because I dont make enough to afford a place to live. Im an aspiring writer whos dream is to be published, but who gets little to no good feedback from what I do. Im an abuse survivor who continues to be abused and used at every turn, and in every way. Im a trans who finds very little if any enjoyment from my own body. I have two friends, one is my girlfriend who lives in another country, and the other is moving away from me in a month. Family doesnt want me, and those who do want a better version of me. I work five days a week, and have very little time to get out of the house. My life is a cycle of abandonment, and false promises. I have a hard time trusting others, and a harder time trusting myself. Ive been suicidal before, and Im passed that, Im to the point where I dont even want to put in the effort to attempt it. Everything I do in life is just leading to another dead end. I dont ask for much, I just want to be able to say I had a good day for a change where I smiled genuinely. I want one thing to go right. I want the cycle to break. The world has no color to me anymore, its all just grey, dull and lifeless. I dont know what to do, dont know what I can do",

This school year tenth grade my academics are horrendous. I have failed math in 23 terms 51 first term, dropped into 40s for 2nd term and my science grade was in the mid 60s for term 1 and i think i failed term 2.

I am a competitive dancer and have always been super passionate and serious about it, and now i just dont care any anymore. My dad who has been apart of my whole life but not really at the same time because hes a drunk ashle is in critical condition and is dying. I dont know if its because of the emotional trauma and physical abuse he has caused me throughout the years, but i also feel numb to him dying. i feel like i wont even give a shit when hes gone and i know that sounds absolutely awful but i seriously dont feel anything I honestly have no idea how to deal with this right now, because my mom doesnt really believe im depressed and wont take me to a therapist. I know 10th grade is the most important year for math and science academics where i live and i honestly feel like its too late to fix anything. now i cant help but think im going to flunk out of high school and end up working at a gas station for the rest of my life someone please give me some sort of direction or guidance on what i could possibly do because i feel really lost and confused right now, and im terrified about my future with my poor academics right now edit sorry if theres a bunch of grammatical errors, its late at night and i didnt feel like proof reading this before i posted it.",

I got addicted to benzodiazepines and went to a rehabilitation hospital...but because of the lockdown nothing changed. My family live in another city and so many friends left me, I feel alone but with the time it feels good. Im also bisexual, I know that since Im 13 but never talked about that with anyone. Only to my therapist now the second lockdown ist here in germany, sitting here and accepting every day that its okay to die alone or stay my howl life alone.... I dont know....after one year staying in my thoughts and got also back to benzodiazepines now... Is this all? Is this the sense of my life? What will happen after death? I dont feel like anyone would care about me I tried to kill myself once My anxiety got so bad, Im always paranoid and hate myself because Im skinny. Thats why I would never let anyone touch me or things like sexual, because of my shame for my own body. Im going only outside when Im going to eat something or when its dark and not that much people there because I think there would always say things about me because I feel like shit. Even when I know they dont, its unnerving. Also after that long time here alone I dont wanna do anything anymore, I feel disconnected from the world, playing computer games and drinking wine. I hate this society, the people who life that normal life and I hate me, at some point i think likeWhy? Why I cant be normal like them... Every morning I wake up and think likeShit why Im still alive. But if I have a clear mind and Im not on drugs, I would never kill myself because of my mom.... It would ruin her life...

    "Hello I need some advice about this. Hello, I have been dating my girlfriend for a while now. She has been dealing with depression most of her life. She bravely decided first semester of freshman year of college of last year to go to therapy. She is also doing her best to recover from self harm. I dont know her exact severity but the college has her on a watchlist. She really wants to change but has trouble getting out of the mentality she has grown up with for so long. She has planned to take her life but from what I can gather she has postponed it. To quote her You referring me will never know Im gone if I did meaning she wouldnt tell anyone. At night when she is alone is when she feels the most depressed, to the point where sometimes she has become a nihilist and only wants her death. I understand that its all up to her to change and her suicidal tendencies dont mean she doesnt love me. Unfortunately due to our situations we became long distance partners. However, I have done what I think is good support. My questions that I have are What can I do to better support her? Is there some things that I need to say or do to better support her? Feel free to ask more to get a better gauge on the situation. Id appreciate if you guys want to discuss deeper into it though if we do, could it be through private messaging as I wouldnt want the comments to be filled with so much info. Thank you so much for listening. Any and all help is appreciated.",
    "I feel like I have to kill myself, it's inevitable I think that there isnt any other option, and that in the end it will always come to this anyways. Like no matter what I do, I need to die. Ive always felt like dying is my only option whether I like it or not, and theres really no reason for me to be here anyways. Ive been in therapy and different treatments for so long, and it just always comes back to me wanting to stop existing. There have been days where I think it could get better, but that stops pretty quickly. Ever since middle school Ive been thinking about ending it. Its only until recently that Ive made a true plan and stuff. I feel like a complete asshole because I have a great life, my parents love me, yada yada, and yet I still feel this way. Im still so tired and lonely and I feel like a complete fuckup. Honestly, its not even that I want to commit suicide, I just dont want to exist anymore. Its just that suicide seems like the only way of accomplishing that? I dont know if this even makes any sense.",
    "I've been alone for so long I think I'm losing communication skills My parents make going out and having fun really difficult especially my step dad who constantly tracks my phone location and my bank information. He makes sure to mention every time I withdraw my own hard earned money from my account making me subconsciously feel wrong just for using my own money. Same thing with going out with my friends, he makes me feel wrong for wanting to have fun, instead he just cares about me working my youth away as a slave for someone else just for this fucking money that I hate so dearly. Its been like this for me basically forever, Ive constantly had elders over me telling me what I should do, what I shouldnt do, things I must seek out, thinks I cant touch with a 10 foot pole etc. and Im sick and fucking tired of it. At no point in my short life have I personally be able to make my own choices or decisions and now that thats been my life when it actually comes to me personally making decisions for myself I dont know how to. It feels like I need someone with me at all times to help me make decisions because Ive never had the opportunity for myself to make decisions, someone else always was more obligated to make decisions for me instead of myself and now Im a complete wreck in life because of it. I think this method of raising me plus child abuse is why I just feel so isolated in this reality now. But now I think all this loneliness in my life is finally starting to add up and take its toll on me. In school from elementary until I hit puberty at around 7th8th grade I was a goofy class clown fun person who had no problem making people laugh and brighten up the whole room. But when my hair started thinning around 9th grade I started to get significantly more and more shy and more depressed and withdrawn from other people out of fear of being judged for being weird or awkward eventually this fear caught up with me my junior and senior years of high school where every single person Id have ever interacted with would judge my appearance or my hair because of how poorly it looked. I felt like I resembled a corpse because of how dead inside I really started to become, and even became more and more obsessed with death and wanting to be dead.",

    "Eating. (Tw) I can barely eat 2 meals a day anymore. Today I had nothing for breakfast, a cookie for lunch and a few slices of pizza and a few chips for dinner. My family keep putting food infront of me but I always say Im not hungry. I cant tell Im loosing weight but apparently my family can. I cant help it. I exercise for hours a day and eat little food. I feel like fainting alot of the time. But I dont want people to find out I havent been eating so I eat tiny amounts, and then continue on. I drink tea to get me through the day. Im constantly tired, cold and angry all the time. I dont know whats happening to me. A few months ago I would look at people who said they mentally couldnt eat and say they were stupid, but now Im the person I called stupid. I guess it started when I found out I was transgender. I started working out because I hated my body. As time went on, I started to work out more. And as more time went on I started to eat less and less. Help me. I cant stand it. But I cant stop. No matter how much I want to eat and be healthy. I cant. My mind wont let me.",
    "Stuck between moving forward and killing myself Then for Christmas, I sent her a simple card, but never got a response nor did I expect one to be honest. At this point I have accepted she wont talk to me, that she will not come back to me and probably will never do so. However, I cannot accept never getting a chance with her again. In MarchApril she is leaving the country and I fear I will never see or talk to her again in person. All I need is to talk with her and some understanding. Though I know I have messed things up so bad. I have put so much stress on her. I have done everything wrong while I knew better, but still I did it. So far I have been diagnosed with MDD and Persistent Depressive Disorder PDDso a double depression, and they said I show signs of anxiety, bipolar disorder, and a personality disorder e.g. avoidant, dependent, antisocial, existential OCD. I am still at the early stages so I wont have a definitive diagnosis for a quite some time still. What is certain is that there is something really wrong with me. Most of it originates from my horrible childhood and upbringing. Only the MDD was actually caused by the breakup. Still, my ex thinks she and the breakup are the main causes of my current state, but that is simply not true. Of course, I cannot tell her as she wont speak to me nor believe me. ampx200B Now here is my dilemma I feel the pressure to move forward with my life. I feel like I have to take on all these life responsibilities again that I have to live my life to the fullest. I always felt like that, but because I keep overthinking everything I become this passive person who does only the minimum. I feel incredibly weak, pathetic, and scared to do almost anything, like a little kid in grown mans body. Even though I know I can do some things well, I just do not have any solid confidence. If I do nothing then my life wont get better and I will for sure never get back with my ex. Though I dont see the point of putting in all this effort to do things if it doesnt make me happy.",
    "Just really super depressed right now, obviously... This is my first post here so I dont know whats required or normal. Im just really feeling awful. Dont sleep or sleep way too much. Either dont eat at all or eat way too much. Constantly stuck in why bother mode for literally everything. Dont want ot get out of bed ever, it only when Im forced for work or to go to the bathroom etc. I dont have a whole lot of a support system. Maybe a small amount of family left and an more small amount of kind of friends. And yes am in therapy but it doesnt seem to help. Seriously, soo sorry for the whole life story but again dont know this works exactly. I promise i wont be so long winded again..",
    "I wish I wasn’t so worried all the time. I wish I was actually brave for once. I wish I didn’t always think about what others think about me. I wish I could let go of the past. But I can’t. For the longest time, Ive had this dream that Ill be a musician. Singing songs and making people happy. Making myself happy. Ive wrote songs before, Ive played many instruments before, Ive spent hours playing around secretly in GarageBand. I took singing lessons for a while. In the 4th grade I was in the 5th grade music class, because apparently I was ahead of my classmates. I played piano, and took up drums for a while. I quit singing lessons last year. The violin is gone now. And every once in a while on some stupid magical moment, I play piano. But I still long for music. Even with drawing, which I put my heart and soul into, I still long for music. Even when sewing, I sing. Even when Im outside, I sing and sing and cry. Because Im so weak. Im weak because I couldnt sing in front of others. Im weak because Im so shy. Im weak because I couldnt even sing properly with my singing teacher. I never let go. Im so mad at myself. I want to let this dream go, but I dont at the same time. Isnt it enough for me? Art, drawing, and sewing? Why do I still cling to music? I cant sing. I sound horrible when Im standing in front of people. My legs shake and I cry. I cant even sing outside anymore, because Im afraid of neighbors hearing. I can only sing with headphones on because even I judge myself. Im my worst enemy. Why do I STILL want to sing? Why do I still find myself singing when I can? Why cant I just let this stupid dream go? This stupid worthless dream. Im going to art school to draw, which Im still bad at. Im not going for music. I want to let go of song.",
    "Why am I so sensitive to everything?? Today my depression got worse and I cried twice today. Lately everything bothers me. If a negative comment is said about someone else, it triggers and gives me depression and anxiety. I have this fear that the negative comment said about someone else, somehow may apply to me now or in the future. Why am I so sensitive? Why am I taking on other peoples burden?? It was so bad today. My mind was racing and I was having so many negative thoughts. I notice that my sensitivity is heightened when I increase my social media usage, all of the opinions and thoughts of other people particularly negative ones is too much for my brain to handle",
    "I want to be happy again. I never tell my secrets to anyone. Living in a rented room. Financially fucked, Relationships fucked. I feel like a failure. I failed to become a good son, friend, brother, grandson or colleague. I have become more secretive from last 2 years. I eat secretly, want to live secretly deleting my pictures from social media. I sometimes think If my parents die then I would have no one to answer and then I can live this miserable life for long. I dont think about my future at all. I have not reached the suicide point yet but I think this is how you reach there eventually. I cant imagine myself having a simple life with family and kids and work. I get very anxious imagining that will I be able to do that for these many years. I blame myself for all this. I did not take action when it was needed. In the end, I just want to be happy.",
    "Girlfriend started taking antidepressants and pushing me away Hi 24 Mmy gf of 4 years 22F has  I believe been struggling with various degrees of depression for a very llong time probably since before i met her but she only recently 1 week started to get some medical help. She just got worse. She rarely talks to me and when she does it is short answers. Most of our conversations are about her telling me how shitty she feels, sick, or seeinghearing stuff because of the meds or how she just wants to sleep all day. I decided to give her some space but today I really felt like calling her to check up on her and in the first 30 seconds of the call she started acting like an asshole to me and i got pissed. I now feel shitty about it because i know she is struggling but at the same time I wont be treated like a carpet. Its important to know we live close by but Ive been out of the country for almost 2 months now so we havent seen each other in a while  I should return in a few weeks. I dont know how to help her. I told her to hold on until the meds can help her but I am at my wits end, feeling like I am losing her. Help me to help her please Edit the medication is called citalopram",
    "My depression has been so bad, no one has tried to contact me for months to check up and it tears me apart Everytime Ive felt that my relationship with a person is stable and we connect and have known eachother for years, I get proven wrong. I now naturally feel intense instibility in friendships, or seeking out friendships in general, because I now expect people to already have a circle of close friends, and I cant be apart of that. And it keeps happening, even online mutual friends have not reached out to me despite seeing my personal posts and how much of a hard time Ive been having this year. Even me disappearing for months did nothing. I feel intensely stupid and selfish, while at the same time feeling like if I had killed myself during these months of such bad depression, life would resume and no one would know. I feel stupid and selfish because I absolutely know its not peoples responsibility to worry about me, especially when they are living their lives and are probably going through their own issues, and I shouldnt be throwing my frustration and bitterness on people. But it feels Ive been just left in the dark while online mutuals who have known me for years, continue to enjoy their interactions with eachother and pretend nothing is happening unless they want to engage in a post thats not a personal one. Theres a lot of different issues in my life which have contributed to my diagnosis of depression and anxiety, but this year it feels like God wants to keep telling me no one cares for you. Til this day I dont know how people make lifelong friendships with people you have so much history and connection with. Maybe because of my own insecurities and outlook on friendships, Im simply expecting something that normally isnt how it works. I just feel so suffocated whenever Im online, its like I want to scream at everyone and say LOOK AT ME PLEASE, IM SUFFERING RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU, I THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS and for never paying attention when I suffered so much and continue to suffer, but want to interact with me on posts that are not about my personal mental health. What happened to making sure everyones okay? Do I not matter enough? Are they just sick and tired of me now? I cant even reach out in this kind of situation because again, I shouldnt be demanding people think about me.",
    "I don't have any friends I feel so unwanted and worthless. Im 19 years old and I am extremely isolated. I live in a depressing, toxic enviroment that I cannot seem to escape from. I think I have learned helplessness. i dont have a job or go to school because my ADHD is literally ruining my fucking life. My real life friend left me on read. A friend I made from reddit, i ghosted him to see if hed give a shit about me and i just do maniplative fucked up shit like that and test people to see if they really care about me. Now he doesnt really want to talk to me, i feel it in the texts. Everyone around me treats me like im trash and an annoyance and i dont blame them. I dont like myself at all. I just feel so worthless because the person i was talking to seemed to be the only one that understood and listened to me and now i dont feel like id ever get that support again and i JUST FEEL SO FUCKING ALONE AND HELPLESS. Its like i have to beg and beg for someone to care about me more than i care about myself. My mother cares but she does do some fucked up abusive things at times and make me even more depressed and im just lost. I live with the person who SA me as a child and i have to see his face everyday. My beloved grandmother died before my pedophile of a grandfather last month and im just so fucking angry. Im angry that no one cares. Most people wont read this as manpilative as I sound. Im just so fucking tired. I just want to be loved and cared for in the way i want.",
    "Complete recovery after depression is a realistic expectation? I also got fired right before Christmas for sleeping too much at work and doing almost nothing because of my depression, but I wasnt even mad about it. I mean, I cried because crying was like my main occupation along with sleeping and because I knew thats what Im supposed to do when I get fired but I didnt really feel much about that event. In January I went in a trip to New York with one of my best friends and I enjoyed every moment of it! Then I came home and started looking for a new job. I was so relaxed and carefree and I was becoming my old self again. In February I started a new job and shortly after that I stopped my antidepressants treatment. But I feel like this journey of becoming my old self again is never going to be complete. Sometimes I get close to what I used to be before this whole thing but I cant sustain that, like the oldhappyme is visiting sometimes but she doesnt wanna stay. Even though things go great for me now great new job, great old friends, new healthy romantic relationship I am mostly anxious and scared. I cant be genuinely happy with the good things I have in my life, because the fear of losing them and going straight back into depression is overwhelming. I heard things like youll never go back to what you used to be before depression, depression leaves a scar youll have to live with your entire life, depression is a part of growing up, you just cant go back. I am starting to believe these things and its sad. Are they true? I have no chance to going back to my old self?",

Because everytime I make a friend on reddit, eventually I tell them where Im from and I never hear back from them after that. Anyways, I graduated college last year and I work from home these days. I spend most of my time working on weekdays. And I spend my weekends lying in bed all day and listening to asmr. I dont feel I have anything in life anymore that really makes me happy. Ive got a couple friends in this city but I dont feel like meeting anyone. I dont feel like watching anything on tv either. Idk nothing makes me happy anymore. Theres nothing that I look forward to anymore. The things that I think I might enjoy it feels like the effort required to do those things is much more than the pleasure Ill get out of them. I just dont feel like doing anything anymore. The little energy I have all goes into my job even in that aspect I thing Im just getting by. I feel so tired and unhappy and empty and bored all the time. I want to be happy but theres nothing that makes me happy anymore. Nothing worth doing.

    "How to get myself moving again Ive been suffering from severe depression for the last 18 months. Culminated in a suicide attempt back in December. After that I managed to get myself back on my feet after a while, started therapy and was working on a course I cared about. Just under a month ago, I visited where I used to live to catch up with some friends etc. I felt ready for it. It was a mistake though and it threw me back into a severe depression. Actually my therapist believes I am suffering from PTSD and going back seems to being back a lot of negativity. After 3 weeks of suicidal thoughts, sleeping 18 hours a day and just feeling awful... Im feeling slightly better again, but still not back in a positive place. Id like to get started again on my course and to begin to build back healthy habits. But I sit in front of my laptop and Im really struggling to get myself to do anything at all. Are there any techniques I can use to begin to build up some motion? I know once things begin to move Ill start to feel better again, and long term hopefully therapy and medication can fix this bind Im in... but short term Im struggling to take that first step. In every direction I look, things seem very difficult.",
    "My mom told me she hated me, asked me to never contact her again and called me a “low life b$;!?” I would never use such words to my children. I don’t understand how a parent couldn’t love and support who she birthed? Hurt.💔😞 Relationship with mom was never great as a child, but I always made excuses for her. She really never held the responsibility of my raising it was always amongst someone else. I dont feel like I was ever raised I think I was only ever baby sat. I dont understand why my family never gave me away to someone who would have loved me? I was always moved from place to place as a child within different family members. Just long enough for a person to get tired of me and then moved to the next house until I was forced to take care of myself at 16 years old and nobody has cared for me since. It hurts living in the world and needing advice and support but having no one to turn to because all you remember is only ever having yourself. I remember living with family members and only having two outfits and at a young age I was forced to wash my own clothing because no one would do it for me. I have no choice but to think back at these times when looking for advice and support because I never have had anyone. My mom thought she was doing a deed to keep me away from my father as a child now Ive grown up to have no one. I resent her for it. But Im ready to move on how do I let all of this pain go so I can be happy in life? Its easier said than done been trying to do it for years. All advice helps",
    "Loneliness is taking over me I never realized how much I rely on having human contact and connection. I recently went through my first heartbreak and I lost a best friend and Im losing my other friend. I feel like neither of them cared about me as much as I cared about them. I feel like everybody has somebody that loves them back and for some reason that makes me feel worse. I feel like I give my heart entirely to people and it hurts so badly when its not reciprocated in the end. I know thats selfish of me but I wish I knew what I was doing wrong. I feel so alone and all I wish I could have was a genuine human connection. It doesnt have to be romantic. Just to have someone be there and not leave me. My depression is coming back and the negative thoughts are even worse than before. For the first time Ive really thought about giving up on life because I feel so useless and not good enough. I have one friend left but Im afraid to rely on someone to make me happy. I know it isnt fair. We talked and he made me feel better but when we dont talk the emotions come back. How can I be happy with being alone. I dont know what to do. I just want to feel hope and happy with myself. All I do is sleep because the days are too painful to live through.",
    "Anyone here have reverse seasonal affective disorder - i.e.: summer depression? If so, could use some advice For the past two summers like clock work around the last week in July I have been hit with the above  I dont know what else it is other than reverse SAD. It usually starts with a general few months of feeling good and stable  meaning Im feeling normal, motivated and generally happy with some dips that Im used to for the most part. The past two summers I will have a really good dayweek whatever and then one morning Ill wake up and feel hungover or in a fog even though I havent done anything to bring this on like drinking, using substances. Also, Im quite active physically  so thats also strange. Whats even more frustrating are the physical symptoms my legs feel like noodles and I feel like I cannot wake up despite caffeine and Adderall. Two summers ago it hit me at a physical therapy appointment literally felt so incredibly off that I had to sit down for a minute. The PT said maybe it was menopause. Wanted to throttle him, lol. In a span of 24 hours I went from a normal mood to really off. It progressed to the point where I spent most of August in bed  only getting up to use the washroom and do basic things. I vividly recall literally crawling to clean the cat box my body felt so heavy. I actually felt paralyzed. I also recall having to return and item I borrowed from a friend and having to drive and being so out of it I wasnt sure I could. It felt as if I was wading through deep water or mud. Last summer I wasnt expecting it Bc I thought the summer before was just a fluke or hormones but I vividly recall the day before I was very productive did a lot around the house and generally felt up. The next day when I got out of bed, my legs were like noodles going down the stairs and I felt off. I was sitting drinking coffee when my husband looked at me and asked if I was ok. I thought I was just tired, but as the days progressed I got worse and worse. It took me months to recover Bc I couldnt find any type of add on medication that I could tolerate that helped.",

    "Husband prioritize more Video Games I have an underlying condition like asthma and heart problem thats way we I opt to work from home and also my husband took a leave from him work to be safe from this virus. But recently he had this hobby and went back to video gaming and streaming through twitch. He is so into it and focus that he always wants things to be done quickly or fast like eating, resting, watching,cooking, movie or talking with me. Im being supportive with him. I even volunteer to make the twitch banner and logo for his twitch channel. But he said when I tried to talk to him and discuss about priorities just like now, Im not feeling well and I having extreme tummy aches and sore throat He said Im always criticizing and negative on him. He said I dont support him and I always go negative. I was hoping this quarantine is also a time for us to bond and get more time together but he always wants to play and stream. I felt like its okay to play and stream once in a while but not to the point you spent almost 8hours or more streaming and neglecting important things. Am I wrong in this? I just feel so unimportant and always second priority. I guess all I have is myself at the end of the day. Whatever I say or do, I always get the blame and Im the one wrong  Im so tired and broken.",

    "No appetite, suggestions? Hiii and thanks in advance for any advice here. I struggle even wanting to talk about it because my family members are all I have, and they all 3 have binge eating habits. I feel guilty about it so please be gentle with me. About 4 or 5 years ago when my mental health started taking a nose dive I noticed I started losing my appetite. I started to fluctuate around 2030 lbs throughout these years. I have no trouble continuing to drink. Ive mentioned it to my doctors but they have never elaborated on it with me, and I have had blood drawn a few times, making it seem like its not as much of a problem. But its getting worse, no matter what food I prepare or go pick up I can only eat a few bites before I cant even chew it anymore and have to put it away. And I only do that 12 times a day. Its really starting to get to me. Does anyone here also go through this? Ive thought about some kind of protein drink for when Im on the brink of passing out.

    "I think my boyfriend left me due to his depression and I need some help to understand and deal with this situation. tldr at the bottom Although I have more than enough mental problems on my own, depression probably isnt one of them. But it is the problem of my now exboyfriend. He isnt someone who talks much and I really tried to talk to him but its hard to get any real information from him and although he seems to try to answer me, most times the answer is some variation of I dont know. So I thought Id ask you guys if anything in my story sounds relatable to you and if you have any idea about the situation of my ex and can maybe explain the things he cant Of course I know that you can just make guesses but Im trying really hard to understand him and Im just so confused. We both have our own problems but as a couple I wouldnt say we had any major problems. In the last months his depression got worse and I tried to support him but more often than not he prefers to be alone when hes feeling very bad and then I just try to give him enough space. Thats why were not as close as I would have liked but this slowly improved over time, so I was patient. We didnt see each other for a month due to badly timed holidays and when I came back, he broke up with me. His reasoning was something along the lines that he thinks Im feeling more for him than vice versa and that our relationship was more like a friendship. Which I think is true and at the same time isnt... Its definitely not just a friendship, but because I tried to not put any pressure on him and let things be more casual at times, we werent already there where I would like my relationship to be. That was two months ago. Were still texting each day and sometimes meet  were not having sex or kissing but still, he doesnt treat me just like a friend and it seems like he doesnt want to. Were officially broken up... but were not just friends.",

I mean I can type it here because I feel like you guys dont feel obligated to read this and you just do it because u have time. I feel like she has to listen to me no matter what and I feel even more uncomfortable around older women and especially talking about my feelings around people I cant do that. I feel selfish and guilty for showing feelings. What should I even do? I dont know what to do anymore.

    "My mother and I had an unsettling conversation in the midst of my depression, and I don't know how to feel... My mother quickly took me out of that daycare and felt so bad for leaving me there. Ive always remembered preschool, but Ive never known what actually happened in that building. After that event, the teens were arrested, and since today, that building had been shut down for 11 years. The next one, the first one I recall, was when I was in elementary school. I was in kindergarten, and the teachers were very strict, and they had the worst principal I had ever seen. He had beaten, tortured, and yelled at many kids, including me. I was once beaten, dragged to the office, and tied to a chair for the rest of the day in my kindergarten year. My mother was pissed off as the school when she saw my bruise marks. When I heard this happened to me, I remembered and regained my perspective on that moment, and two others I now recall. Another time I remember that was mentioned to me was in that same school in about first or second grade. This one kid would bully me over and over, and he would beat on me if he ever caught up to me, and the teachers just let him. One day, I thought I had put up with this crap far too much and was beating that kids ass. It took four teachers to pull me off him. They told my mother to immediately come to the school for my actions, and she took me out for ice cream for standing up for myself, and we were pissed off about how the teachers just let bad things happen to kids at that elementary school. The last memory I remember was in that same year in that same elementary school. One time, I feel off the top of the slide in the playground and busted my head open on the pavement. I was bleeding everywhere, and I now remember how bad it felt. The teachers were just again, standing there. Not even helping, not even calling for emergency services. Just watching. They didnt even call my mother.",

Of course, Im aware that sometimes these things are not as simple as I think and everyone is different.

    "How do you, not only keep existing, but actually be productive, when you're depressed everyday? As someone who has chronic, but still functioning depression, its been a real struggle to be productive and better myself while Im depressed, which, unfortunately, is practically everyday for me. I usually do the bare minimum going to work, making myself look put together, etc. But, tasks outside of that tend to fall by the wayside, and I notice that Im not bettering myself or my future. I have looked this up before, i.e. how to do things when youre depressed and usually I come across articles that explain how to get basic things done and reminding the reader that the small stuff is important too. While I really appreciate this sentiment, I want to know, how do I not only exist with my depression, but also flourish? Like, doing things that will favor me in the long run? What do other people with depression do? Maybe some success stories would be helpful? also, a side note Im currently being medically treated for depression, so Im not really looking for specifically medical advice Thank you!",

    "how to cope after being made the asshole? Im not sure if this is the right place to post, but here it goes! SO, basically!!! I posted in AITA earlier today naively thinking that I wasnt the asshole and seeking some validation. Turns out, I ammmm the asshole! I wont get into it but ofc you can click my account and find the post and everyone is saying some negative things about my character Im not trying to deny their consensus, but I think its triggered something in me. Ive cried four times already and havent found the energy to move from my spot since posting, except for necessity. I just feel so, so, so deeply sad Ive had severe depression in the past and am not currently in an episode, but Im not sure how to feel okay right now. I feel so sad, and my mind is heavy, and I feel like a bad person. This blackwhite mentality of them saying Im an asshole in this situation, and everyone downvoting me just trying to have a discussion, translates to me as I guess I must be an asshole of a person in general. I feel paralyzed and no energy Im just seeking help on how to get out of this funk, out of this mentality. I dont know how to separate myself from I did an asshole thing to I must be a shitty person and I cant move and I AM IN THE MIDDLE OF MOVING APARTMENTS.

The episodes were years ago, but when I look at everything together I jus think wow... 4. I have been in basically a sexless marriage for 19 years. 5. I have cheated by getting happy endings and watching porn. I feel horrible about this. 6. I am unemployed. I cant keep a job. No one will hire me. I am an older worker and dont know what to do. 7. I want to get out of the marriage but dont know how. I cant support myself. ITS OKAY TO BE DEPRESSED RIGHT? I CANT THINK STRAIGHT..... I LITERALLY cant think straight. I cant focus on getting things done.",
    "I sabotaged my relationship with my sister and hate myself so much for it I dont know what to do anymore. I skip almost every family event on purpose. I havent gone to see them for a very very long time, I dont know since when. Yesterday my sister was having a baby shower and I told everyone Id be there, but I fell into a depressive hole this weekend and even though I put shoes on and grabbed keys and a bag, I still did not go. Idk why. I didnt know anyone else that was going to be there and that made me just freeze and not go. Now my sister hates me Im sure. She posted on her story a picture that said being constantly let down by the one person you looked up to all your life is really exhausting. Which hurt, but its absolutely true. It hurts because I fucking make these choices and I hate them. I have the time. I have the ability. I just choose to fucking stay home instead and I HATE myself. She will probably never talk to me again. Idk what to do.",
    "I feel like a failure, because I'm failing to get certain things done I am really struggling with certain aspects of my life, I cant get motivated. I am diagnosed with depression and anxiety and have been receiving various forms of therapy for the past two years since my son was born. I believe that I have suffered with depression since way before my son was born but the signs werent recognised until I was being seen by a health professional regularly. I am very lucky to have a roof over my head, a loving husband and a full time job. However, I cannot seem to escape the void of depression. Currently Im in a the crippling pit, and I cannot motivate myself with certain things. I dont take my medication, I know I should but I have some sort of mental block that stops me taking it. My work is suffering because Ive found a way to get by, doing the day to day tasks but not doing my daily reports. I would describe myself as high functioning depressed as I can get out of bed and get dressed, but the only reason I do this is my son. I live with my husband and in laws and Ive just realised that Im not happy anywhere. Im not happy at work, Im not happy at home. I get on well with my in laws but they drive me crazy by parenting my son. At work I feel out of my depth and like Im just winging it, badly. I just want to escape, and the only way I can think of to escape is suicide but I cant bear the thought of not seeing my son grow up. He is my lifeline but what kind of mother is he growing up with? I cannot motivate myself to tidy up after myself, only my son. I cant motivate myself to take my meds, check in with my therapist, or complete my work properly. I am just existing enough to keep my son fed, bathed and clothed, but I am not looking after myself. Sorry if this post had no direction or real question, I just hope there is maybe someone whos been through something similar and is now on the other side who may have some advice.",

Or chase my dream and lose that goal of getting a house, putting financial strain on my relationship and run the risk of not getting married to the one?

When Im not at work the feelings of sadness come back and Im a recluse. I dont really have any friends to speak of, Ive gotten fat, I dont have a girlfriend and I never leave my house. None of my past hobbies interest me anymore. For a long time I ignored the symptoms because its such a taboo in my field. But I finally realised thats not helping.

    "\"Paying for happiness\" - anyone else? It is as if my body and mind HAVE to revert back to a depressive norm, like a rubber band snapping back the higher I stray from it, the more intense the snapback. This is devastating, even as I have recognized the pattern and come to expect it. It literally feels like I am punished by my own bodymind for daring to experience happiness or joy. It feels like a cruel trick by the Universe every time, or like I have to pay the piper for not feeling depressed for one damn day. I have considered the possibility of bipolar disorder, but I really dont think thats it. Certainly yoyoing between joy and depression has that weird polarity, but the happiness is always caused by externals  a trip somewhere, quality time with friends, a great experience, etc. It doesnt just come out of nowhere. I really have to find and create the happiness. It is the punishment that has no rhyme or reason aside from following the pattern. It is inevitable even if nothing bad happens to bring me down  its just a crash, like a plane running out of fuel and dropping out of the sky. And while the happiness can feel euphoric sometimes, it doesnt feel like any kind of manic episode Ive heard or read about. It is more just the joy of feeling some goddamn unvarnished happiness for a little while. Does anyone else experience this? Any suggestions? !",
    "What helps you with your insomnia? I remember how relaxing and fulfilling it was to sleep when I was a kid. I couldnt get enough of it! I slept with my blankie, I sucked my thumb, I snuggled, I was never cold when the window was open, and I hated having to wake up for school in the morning. At 14 I first got depressed and started experiencing uncomfortability during sleep I was always very cold. Then, at 18, I got into a depressive episode and with the pressure to study well at uni my social anxiety increased. I couldnt go out during the day because I felt like all the people around were judging me for not working hard enough, not looking well enough, and other things. So I started sleeping through the day and living at night. Now that Ive worked through social anxiety it is not quite so bad and I enjoy getting up early in the morning because it feels like the proper and healthy way to go about my day. However, no matter how much or how little I do during the day, I cant fall asleep at night. Im just not tired. Its kinda like leaving the car running Im not doing anything, but the thoughts are racing inside my head. Ive tried the 478 breathing technique, progressive muscle relaxation, but nothing seems to work. I also try to eat early and let fresh air into the room. What helps you to calm down before going to sleep? Thanks for the answers, I love everybody",

Then, my dad asked me what was bugging me, and I know something is, but I dont know what. I just told him nothing and said I havent changed, I still get good grades and hang out with friends, but Now that they brought it up, I do notice a change in myself. even though I know something has changed, I dont know what.

I have a friend teenager, he is good at anything specifically, he doesnt have hobbies, nor does he have anything he wants to do... and naturally depression kicked in, noone noticed for a while, I personally found out about it being serious just about... 3, maybe 4? hours ago... he sent me a message saying bye, im suiciding which on its own, with no context, seemed as a stupid stupid joke... so naturally I said that this isnt a topic to joke about, and eventually put some things together He doesnt have hobbies  goals, He smokes recently started which is horrible imo, he drinks , and he was known to have been overly depressed before, but nothing came out of it, it seemed like he had a rougher time with small things, I started to get worried so I digged deeper... talked with a few common friends and only 1 was able to be of help, the friend suicidal had plans... everything. step. by. step. It was actually pretty .... yikes idk... scary, and I got to talk with him, explained to him as nice as one could, that he needs, and he agreed, and said, what about telling your parents? they sure will helped. what followed had me mute. litterarly. HE DID! and his dad is an alchoolic that doesnt care, overall a cool guy to have a drink with and have some fun talk, but not a dad. for sure not. and his mother seemed really active and protective, which she isnt... he told his mom about his issues, and she said well you better get on studying and stop with this bad word poopoo . Which pretty much dug him even further into the hole he is in, I cant help but want to do something, I wont be telling his parents more because I am afraid that he will be punished for speaking his problems out loud, which is wrong, but keeping in mind his parents, not surprising, anything I can do for him?!?",

Doing things i dont want to do requires so much energy, never feels rewarding, and is just so painful. Sometimes it helps other people and that makes me happy. But Im trying to live for myself and i literally cant because I guess every other human can just robotically perform physical actions without motivation. Small goals dont feel rewarding and holding myself accountable never helps because I dont know why i should care what even i think. I know thats silly but thats literally how empty i am.

    "I’m 23, highly anxious, depressed, raised by a narcissist/alcoholic, and need a job. I have no clue what to do with myself. Until Covid I worked in retailrestaurants my whole life as I am extremely personable, albeit an introvert. Now with covid, I very much so do not trust Americans wholeheartedly, Im getting the vaccine but everything is opening up at 100 no restrictions near me, which just makes no sense to me. Poor behavior amongst people these days, retail workers are the frontline of managing Covid and policies these days, for little pay. Now I dont even want these jobs as Ive not been social for over a year now. I did not go to college as I have learning disabilities. I also have awful fine motor skills, likely due to growing up anxious a lot due to alcohol in the house. Father has NEVER been abusive physically or frankly intentionally abusive, theyve never processed any emotions so theyre a mess. Still live with them and constantly triggered by it. I also am sorta addicted to weed, as I believe I have PTSD at this point so I truly feel its a need not a want at this point which is frustrating. I could go on and on lol, so, help? Im truly getting to the point it feels things just aint gonna work out for me, whole life has been out of my control.

She saw that we broke up and she messaged me. Her relationship with her last boyfriend wasnt really working out and they broke up so we decided to talk again as friends and help each other out.. she eventually went to a mental hospital because she wanted to kill herself but I called her everyday she was there.. we had amazing conversations and I could tell she was starting to feel okay now that she was taking medication and getting some therapy.. when she got out I bought her a plane ticket and she came to see me, spent a month here and everything was going amazing and we started dating again.. when she went home I really missed her, wed talk on the phone and text and stuff but I really missed her. I was supposed to fly out in November so I can be there for her birthday but I begged shed come back in October cause I missed her so much, because of that she missed her appointments and couldnt get her medication and stuff and shes been here for a bit now. But she doesnt want to be with me.. the month before everything seemed okay. It was like we were in love again and she said that she thought she was but now that shes off her medication shes falling back into her old toxic behaviors she started developing after the things I did to her.. we argued a lot the first week she was here and I wish I wouldve just kept my mouth shut and I wish that I wouldve just went in November because wed probably still be together right now.. she leaves October 24th and it kills me seeing her here knowing that I had her again.. knowing I was a lot better.. but she doesnt want me anymore.. she says she doesnt want anyone for awhile until she can love herself.. and theres basically no chance Ill have her back.. how do I forgive myself?

    "is this a normal for parents to do? When i was like 1112 years old someone had done a poo in the toilet and left it and my Mum found it and both my brother and I said that we didnt do it. So my Mum made us both bend over in front of Dad and her and wiped our bums for us and then showed everyone the piece of toilet paper and whether it had shit on it or not. I remember her telling us to bend over more because she said she couldnt reach. My subconscious and conscious is telling me im a horrible person for saying this about my parents and that im just imagining it. But i know im not. Its killing me not being able to remember things from this event and from when my Mum left. The next parts foggy but i know that the first part above is definitely accurate I think my Mum wiped my bum and got shit on the paper and blamed it on me or something idk. And then i think my brother had shit on his paper as well. I think we were both ridiculed. I have many traumas involving my parents since then. Im now 18. And ive been in an emotionally incestuous relationship with my Father. My brother beats me. And my Mum doesnt do anything because she feels powerless because shes now a single mother my parents are separated I also reported my brother to the police last year for touching my boobs and beating me with a belt which my mum saw. But nothing happened and i dont think the police believed me because i was overweight. Anyway, whats everyone opinion on the poo wiping situation. Is that normal for parents to do?",

Then a month after that, she apparently had to delete her discord, but from mutual friends I heard that she was still on there daily. Just recently shes messaged me asking to make contact again. I pretended to not see it, because honestly I really thought she was my best friend. I made animatic type videos of us together, so I basically drew us together hundreds of times. We did everything together as well. But I just cant understand what happend, why she just had the sudden change of mind that I wasnt a good friend anymore.

My other friend was a guy who hung out with us. After about a month of covid, he ghosted us and would only ever make contact by texting andor commenting on things we made saying cringe or oh god... and then not responding after that. After about 6 months I got fed up with this so I wrote him a essay on how ghosting and making only rude comments isnt nice and that I was sort of hurt that he was doing this.",

Ive never been mean to a single person in my life but i get treated like shit constantly. I dont know why but when I was a kid I imagined the world was a place full of empathy but literally every single person Ive met has been an unempathetic piece of shit. Im in a friend group thats so toxic it led one of the kids in our friend group to a suicide attempt with a gun but it ended up missing his brain I imagine he got scaredd and moved it at the last second. And even AFTER he attempted and was in the hospital they continued to treat him like shit and told him he shouldve just gone through with it. Dont worry, they also treat me like shit, Im in a similar position to him and I cant leave because I have no other friends. Not only that, but I treat the guy that attempted suicide with absolute kindness, Ive never been mean to him which youd expect him to be thankful for right? Nope, he actually treats me like shit more than the other kids and he even fought me a month ago simply because he hates me that much.

Ive currently been talking to this person and we both hit it off right from the bat. Im talking scarily accurate stuff that we have in common. This person then told me since we are talking more frequently, I figured Id let you know I suffer severe depression and anxiety. So its hard to keep in touch with people who have it and I understand if you dont wanna be around.clearly warning me that our convos wont be like this Of course my answer was I totally understand! Just know Im always around if you wanna ear to listen to  So its been two months now and I know some of yall would think why are you so invested, go live your life which I have been doing. But if it does work out and we do date for real. What advice can I do for me when im in this? This is just so im aware. In my eyes its clear we like each other, despite it only online. Ive tried to see if I could do what my friends told me and its to try and meet other people. But none of them clicked like how it clicked with the person Im talking to. They tell me she probably leading you on and I would simply say,  well why would they send 8 min audios about what were talking about? Or literally offer to watch one of my fav Anime in theaters the next month? Its her depression bro. Overall I understand her position and Im still living my life conquering my goals. But still in the back of my mind, if we do end up maybe being a thing. What would I do?",
    "How can I (32F) stop feeling like such a burden to my husband (36M)? I am going through a very difficult time after two miscarriages in the past couple of months and a recurrence of depression and anxiety symptoms. He works about an hour away, while I work from home, although I have very little work, so most of my days are just spent doing...well, nothing. Im sometimes so depressed I cant keep up with basic chores, which I feel I should be doing since Im home all day. My husband hasnt confronted me about it directly but I think it annoys him. ampx200B Some days I feel okay. Other days I am irrational, fearful and tearful. I have a huge fear that he will leave me, which I have expressed to himand which he always denies, but I know it must get annoying that I keep bringing it up, though I cant seem to help myself. I cant imagine how annoying and difficult it must be for him to come home from work and not know if hes coming home to see me on an okay day or a really bad day. ampx200B Our communication isnt bad, but Ive recently felt myself pulling away and trying to rely on my own inner strength, but sometimes that backfires and I do a 180 and turn into an absolute mess with him. ampx200B I feel like he deserves so much better than having basically a halfwife who is so unsteady. Does anyone have any tipsmantrasetc. for making me feel just...better about how much of a burden I am placing on him? I am talking to a therapist once a week and on medication, but I am still really struggling with these feelings of feeling unworthy and pathetic.",
    "Someone gave me this \"advice\"? Basically I just wanted to ask if this was reasonable advice. This person knows Im extremely suicidal and depressed and have a bunch of mental problems. They also know that Ive been the only one to advocate for myself for years for treatment. I am receiving treatment, and my therapist even says Ive been trying very hard. This persons advice to me was just, Just try harder. You can always try harder. And they refused to understand that sometimes you just cant try any harder, you reach your limit, or even that you might need the help of someone else to help get you through. They said that needing anyone elses help is toxic and unhealthy and thats using someone as crutch, you will never get better, etc. Just completely disregarding everything I am feeling and going through. Am I wrong to feel upset by this? I feel like its a bs answer to shrug off any responsibility as an important person in my life.",
    "My friend, who I will not name. Sent me this at 9:20pm. I don’t know what to do so I came here. He has a serious depression and I don’t know how to make him happy anymore. Sometimes I feel so depressed that i cant cry or do anything anymore. Like i dont want to die, but I dont want to live. Sometimes I want someone to notice that Im sad, but i keep smiling and acting happy so they dont ever know? Or how i love someone so much and they know that no matter how much they hurt me Im still gonna love them like there isnt any tomorrow. Or how i try and try so hard to be the person im not, and then one day it backlashes on me and nobody respect my feelings and decisions.",
    "Chronic Depression and Work Performance Hello. I need someones thoughts or advice. I have several diagnosed illnesses, persistent grieving disorder and pdd with frequent mdes, so thanks brain for the double depression . I am unmedicaded In that past couple months after a huge mde I never quite made it completely out and have been progressively doing worse to a point where my work performance is suffering, Ive received a couple of warnings to get my sh t together not in those exact words but close. Ive never been in such a position where my work ability has lacked because of this. Like I genuinely feel like Im going to either get fired sooner or later or suddenly quit, because of my mental state. I am going to discuss with my psychiatrist medication. We had talked about it before but they basically said we could talk more in detail when I was ready. But a part of me has been considering temporary disability to basically be able to figure myself out, figure out the right meds if necessary, right dosage, etc before putting myself out there to work. I feel so heavy everytime I get ready for the day like what am I going to mess up today and its making everything so much worse. My work frustration is literally dragging me down harder. Im so frustrated with myself and Im so tired of feeling like this all the time. What has everyone here done at work? Has anyone felt like they cant properly perform due to their illness? If so, what have you done about it? What has helped you work wise?",
    "Do you ever see someone happy and it makes you depressed Ever so often I go on Instagram and I always get depressed afterwards. Not because of people showing off their stuff or saying perfect their life is because I know thats bullshit because of the people themselves. They have personalities and lives and friends and dont depersonalize when they go in public theyre comfortable enough in their own skin to be confident enough they have some care to wake up. Even in public if I see someone I wish I was happy enough for confident enough or wasnt as much of a spaz to be it just ruins my day.

Ive been reaching out to local therapists each of which tell me theres a 14 month waiting list. I need someone in my life please. Everyday is the same and doesnt feel like real life anymore.

    "I have tried everything, what else I can try? Hi All, I am chronically depressed, I feel that life is very hard, I feel suicidal and lonely. I have tried lots of antidepressants and many therapies CBT, metacognitive, psychodynamic, you name it... for many years. Over 26 years of attempts. I have tried also some alternative therapies too, like transcranial direct current stimulation, or some herbal medicines or supplements. Nothing worked. I think that I am left with few options like TMS, transcranial magnetic stimulation, electroconvulsive therapies or psychedelic compounds, like psilocybin or LSD. I dont want to give up with life but I cant carry on like this. If you have nay ideas please let me know.",
    "Any advices you would like to share on uplifting self esteem and self awareness ? I have been facing depression over the past couple of years but it only accelerated last 6 months when I lost my job and moved back with my narcissistic parents. Thanks to my over protective and overly concerned parents, I turned out to be an adult who cannot standup to himself, who turned out to be a weakling, lack basic social skills and more importantly does not have the faintest idea who he is, what makes him happy, or the very least what he wants to do with his life. I have been living suicidal over the past 2 months, researching on methods I could deploy to end this no good life, having no point in living. But to be honest, I guess somewhere down there, there is something that tells me that not all doors have closed. I recently had a quick convo with a therapist and with the intial analysis she put forward with my situation, she mentioned that the probable root caus,e that is prone for a quick fix is my lack of self awareness and self esteem. I felt that is true, because I sort of feel like I do not have an identity, like.. Having an opinion on somethinganything, having the strength to stand up to myself, knowing what it is that makes me happy, be it a hobby or an interest. I mean when I spend time with people, maybe friends, or colleagues. They tend to know a lot about the world. Some may be knowledgeble about basic things people should know, some maybe a youtube content provider or some other maybe a social point of source. I want to do something with my life as well like being good at something, but all I do is consume datainformation reddit,trivial information etc.. and not produce any maybe writing a blog because I cant understand what fancies me. ampx200B I want to make my life better, but I just dont know where to begin and I feel like so Lost !",

I only have 1 friend and she is also depressed ik i should surround myself with positive people but idk i just dont We got high a couple months ago and i noticed some cuts on her hand i was stoned so i couldnt really process what i saw and basically forgot about it. About 3 hours after when the effects had calmed down, i remembered that i saw the cuts and asked her about it and she denied it at first but she eventually showed them to me and i asked her why she did it and she told me that she doesnt even know why, she said its stupid and it does nothing for her but she does it anyway. Fast forward to present day, the cuts are now on her wrists not super deep she does it with a box cutter and i have basically begged her not too. She has stopped doing it for about a couple weeks now because she has a job and it requires her to wear a tshirt and she does not want people to notice. I just dont want her to try and take her own life, I try to make her happy whenever im around her but we dont go to the same schools so im not with her all the time. She has about 3 other friends besides me but they are not aware of the situation. We have known eachother for about 3 years now and have been close ever sense im a guy we are very comfortable with one and other but we dont Hug or say we love eachother or anything that we think would make us uncomfortable. We have both established that we dont want to be anything other then friends because we dont want to lose eachother. I dont know what to do, in this situation, I have never been suicidal hopefully will never get to that point. I dont want to lose her and i honestly dont know what Id do if i did, I feel like im not enough to make her happy anymore. Please give me advice.",
    "I'm tired and feel so drained. I know things will get better, but this part really sucks. I recently ended a toxic friendship and it hurts. Im a 44 year old single mom to a very sweet and loving 10 year old boy. Ive suffered from depression since my teens so I know the deal and all the little self care things I can do to help. Im just low on spoons right now. Im on medication but have missed 2 doses due to napping and being off schedule. Ill get back on track today though. This is most likely why Im in a slump today and things feels worse right now. I was in a bad depressive episode for about 45 months in 2020, like many others Im sure. I felt it was finally lifting, but it seems I was wrong. The stress of home learning, being stuck at home, having no social circle or bubble at all has really hit me hard. I dont have many friends, to be honest just one very good friend for the last 20 years or so, but due to COVID19 I havent seen her in about a year. We talk on the phone but its not the same. For the last 10 years I considered another single mom my friend, even though we rarely saw each other and were not close. The friendship was toxic for me and we had many talks about what wasnt working, what was and what I needed from the friendship, with no improvements and I was always sad with this friendship. I ended it last night after talking about things again for the last week or so. I know its the right thing to do for myself, but its so hard. I guess what Im hoping for from this post is support and any advice on how to get over a friendship. With the two spoons I have left today Im going to shower and put on clean pjs and get my son ready for his appointment.",
    "Years of worsening chronic fatigue/fog continue to cripple my life As a result, I feel intoxicated more easilyquickly. Sometimes 1 beer and Im already feeling really drunk. Im slow now both mentally and physically. Head almost always feels very tired and heavy, but I dont get headaches that often. I yawn way too much. Anhedonia and apathy as Ive gotten tireder and tireder. I have gradually become indifferent to most things. I literally come across like an emotionless zombie now because I am so damn exhausted 247. Almost nothing phases or interests me anymore. I feel like I get every coldflu virus that comes around. And it takes me much longer to get over them. I am emotionally flat lined. One of my eyelids droops a little bit, mostly later in the day andor when Im more tired. I feel like I need lots of sleep to recover, but all sleep really does is reset me a little bit and is very unrefreshing. All of these symptoms seem to be worse when Im sick, stressed, get less sleep, etc. Overall, it feels like I was hit by a truck. From the moment I wake up to the moment I pass out from sheer exhaustion at night. Everything feels like its suppressed by this fog that has gradually gotten worse over time. For example, caffeines effect, sex drive, postworkout adrenaline and endorphins, getting plenty of sleep, etc. I can sort of FEEL all these things for the most part, but it feels hidden and pushed down from this utter exhaustion. Its like nothing can surpass the fatigue and fog. Its gotten to the point where I feel like Im living my life from the backseat and am just going through the day mindlessly on autopilot. It literally gives me anxiety and depression to feel like this and not know why, and watch my life just pass me by at the same time. And the thing that sucks is that I WANT to do things and live life, and am still pretty optimistic, but Im just too out of it, its embarrassing. I come across like a drugged zombie when I try.",

    "Living in Israel, as of today. Hi all, Im David, 30, born and raised in Israel. In the central region. This is the first time I write about my inner feelings, especially at these times outer war with Hamas in Gaza, and inner war with farright IsraeliArabs and Farright Jews. Im a happy person. Got a good job, great and supportive partner. I love living, curious on everything life has to offer. from baking, coffee, to movies and games, to travel and cultures around the world. Im keeping myself healthy with vitamins and doing Tim Ferriss 4 Hour Body diet and exercises. Not watching too much public television and getting some news oncetwice a day. Every day Im working from 9 to 6, ending with some different relaxation daily. For the last week, everything around me is changing. It has started with the famous issues in Jerusalem, and later started to go south. Sirens went off every evening, and woke us up every night between 1am and 3am, and also 7pm and 9pm. With every siren, we have 130min to get to a safe area. In that safe area, Im meeting every neighbor that lives around me, some elderly, some couples, and young families, which the mothers are crying out loud from the pressure. Once 130min have passed, we wait for the missiles to get hit by our irondome, or unfortunately fall. Yesterday one missile hit 5 kilometers from me. While this missiles and hits in Gaza is going on  inside the country, in cities where Arabs and Jews living together  theres literally an anarchy. If you look like a jew, orthodox mostly  youll get hit, kicked, and now will be shot. If you look like an arab, youll get hit, kicked, and probably be shot. There was not enough police to keep the area cool. Small groups in their hundreds, are traveling to these cities to protect their people. Jews, Arabs, it doesnt matter. synagogues burnt down, people being pull over and being hit by rocks. You need to identify in front of gangs if you are an arab or a jew. Either  youll be in grave danger. It needs ti be called a civil war non the less.",
    "How can I even tell if antidepressants are working if I have no way to tell? So I was diagnosed with depressionampanxiety when I was 12 and my family wasnt very supportive, they basically chalked it up to teenage angst and did nothing to help me. So now Im 19 and at college and in an environment with friends and a loving boyfriend that actually gives a fuck about whether I live or die. Ive been going to therapy services that my school offers and its helped I think and theyve also got me on my first ever round of antidepressants, Zoloft. Ive been on it for about 2 months and I really thought they were helping, like I could go out in public alone and not freak out. But now I just feel lost and like everything is somehow worse than it ever was before and Ive been bottling it up and repressing it because thats all I know and also I suck at emotion identification because of said repression. I think I was trying to convince myself I was better because all I wanted to do was feel what it would be like to be normal and not have to live with this feeling of dread and hopelessness and wanting of nothing. Mainly I just want to know what itll be like to actually be on something that has a positive impact or something that actually helps instead of me convincing myself it does but actually doesnt. TLDR depressed and thought meds were helping but actually werent. How can I tell that theyre actually helping instead of making it worse?",
    "I am so confused Ill be straight forward, Im not diagnosed yet. I havent really been checked so I may still very well suffer from the condition, but I apologize if I dont qualify to post here. So my problem begins maybe three years back. Out of nowhere Im randomly sad about myself for no reason in particular. I brushed it off as regular old sadness and have no other thought. Then a couple months later I notice its happening more and more frequently. I thought it could genuinely have been depression, but I was convinced into brushing it off as teen angst. Over the next year it stayed the same, random bouts of sadness and lack of motivation for a day or two at the time. Fast forward to now and Ive started being sad nearly daily. I can sometimes go a week and rarely close to a month without experiencing severely as I have, but like I said thats it sometimes. I have suicidal thoughts so often theyve stopped bothering me. I quite often cry at night and have recently started drinking when this happens. I sometimes think I want to die but I know there are people who care. I have a loving family and great friends. I just cant get what I want out of life and I dont want to live a long unfulfilled life. Dont get me wrong, Id much rather be happy and live for as long as possible, but part of me wants to give up. Im not asking for professional diagnosis, but would you say this is regular sadness or am I verging on depression? Thanks, anon",
    "How do I feel human again? For the longest time I have had the issue of feeling like a subhuman or a tool meant to have specific purposes, I have been struggling for the longest time with trying to accept Im a person too and deserve to be treated as such, that Im deserving of love, or to stop putting the needs of others before mine. I wont go into details about what originated this, because frankly no one wants to read Infinite Jest lengths of backstory, but Id like, if anyone can relate, to get some tips on how to ground myself again because Im feeling really, really disconnected from myself lately, even more so than usual, and its very hard to just go thru the motions to maintain the illusion of just being a normal, functional person which I do more for the sake of others than mine tbh. I fear that Ill be exposed as a subhuman and be further alienated from others if I cant keep up the façade and I dont have the time or energy to move elsewhere again to start anew for the nth time. Btw I dont think that tips suggesting hanging with friends or family will work since Im essentially an immigrant all alone in a country other than for his bf, so I dont really have a safety net in a traditional sense and dont want to burden my partner further.

Early this year, I tried to kill myself, and I asked my psychologist if I could be admitted to the government psychiatric hospital cant afford private so she she some research into it and they said that Im not ill enough. This time, I have a detailed plan with a guaranteed method of killing myself, theres no way it could fail, and a set date. But I want to go to the World Cup in Qatar next year. The thing is, as much as I want to go for that, the life that I face in the wait until then us quite horrific.

The fear of people making fun of me, judging me while I clumsily exercise and get out of breath. My psychiatrist has been trying and trying to push me.

I know that my health is much more important than what others think. I just cant manage to bring myself to do it. Its a struggle. He lost it and calmly said he wont see me until I do something.

Ive suggested trying different meds, going with him to talk to someone, taking time off work to trial different meds, he agrees he needs time off though feels bad to his team at work amp his boss. I guess I just need advice on what I can do to help and not be overbearing or annoying to him. Hes gotten a lot worse these past few weeks and I cant help but think Its my fault or Im doing something wrong. I cant say Ive ever been in his position so Im at a loss on what to do.",

    "Losing all hope It cuts to the heart in a way that is not describable. I fall to my knees sobbing and begging the universe to give me a sign, ANY sign, that I should keep going, that there is something worth living for, that there is some meaning in this, that the pain will be worth it in the end. But there is no sign coming. And I look at the world and the enormity of suffering in other places, where children are slaughtered in wars, where women are beaten and raped, where people shoot up schools and kill kindergartners... I look at the people who COULD NOT get sober, at the people who COULD NOT get well, or the people who never had a chance to, because their life was randomly taken from them in a car crash or from cancer or some other bullshit reason. And then I think about the evolution of humankind. I think of all of the millions of creatures that evolved from reptiles to mammals to apes to hominids. At what point did homo sapiens become conscious beings? At one point did we discover sense of self? At what point did meaning begin to matter to us? For all of the many millions of beings that lived before that moment  they had no meaning or purpose. And they represent the VAST majority of the history of animals, of life. And that life? Only represents a tiny fraction of the history of this universe. There. Is. No. Meaning. There is no way to reconcile how some people have the chances and opportunities to grow and to get stronger, while others do not. There is no way to reconcile the fact that our suffering is a blip in comparison to the enormity of the universe and spacetime.",
    "Depression, Depersonalization, Emotional Abuse. HELP. Since about November 2019 Ive started to experience symptoms of depression but i just thought it was some sort of phase or something since Im just a teenager but its now Jan 2021 and those symptoms have constantly been in my brain like they have almost become apart of me. Plus Ive started to experience a few symptoms of depersonalization disorder but once again its only a few and usually I only feel the symptoms to this when Im doing stuff I know my parents would yell at me for. For example one time I smoked weed with some people and In the moment I knew I shouldnt do it and but I felt like telling myself no was just like watching a movie and trying to tell the actor not to do something but what ever you say you cant change the outcome. I didnt get caught but that whole time I felt like I was just on autopilot. Idk if either of my cases could even be diagnosed because I only have a few of the symptoms but these symptoms are persistent but not all that are required to actually have the disorder. I feel like these stem from emotional abuse but once again i feel like the abuse is not like super bad but its there. Like Im consistently told Im the cause of stress in my house and I get yelled at for the littlest things but then an hour later theyll give me a hug and forget it ever happened  this happens everyday. I have a sense of isolation from my family like I live with them but Im like an outsider that doesnt belong. Also I feel like Im forgetting how to be myself like Im usually considered the funny guy or that guy just always knows how to have fun thats but like recently Ive noticed A LOT more of my jokes are missing and me being excited or funny comes off as trying too hard. I dont really know what Im asking for just any advice? So this was saved as a draft about 3 days ago and reading it again makes me realize that my situation is actually a little bit more sever that I thought. I hesitate from posting things like this because part of me feels like Im just doing this for attention. I almost convinced myself to delete this but I mean theres no harm in seeing what people have to say I guess.",

    "My mother and I had an unsettling conversation in the midst of my depression, and I don't know how to feel... They didnt even call my mother. Apparently, their logic was if I was disrespectful, they would call my mother like 22 times, but if I was injured, bleeding, and crying out in pain, they wouldnt give a shit! Ive never wanted to know about this, and now I have other bad memories I probably wont forget soon, even though I want to. To recap, I have have learned something I never wanted to about my past during depression, and now its even worse. Ive tried so hard to keep my life going in the right direction, but every time I try...it seems to get worse... Today, Im going to try a new way of doing things. Instead of deleting my exs requests and messages, Ill ignore her. Instead of being afraid and nervous, Ill send my gf a letter today, and Ill see how it goes. Instead of letting bullying weaken me, I will deal with it in a better fashion. Ill even report it everything. This was the advice I had been given, and I thank my friends on Reddit for helping me. Itll be a while, and I will struggle and sadden on the way, but Ill try... I still feel horrible on the inside and outside, but Ill try as hard as I can to be happy again. I dont know.

    "I feel constantly lonely and as though I’m hated by everyone Ive been feeling this way since I started year 7 and it has been constantly eating at me. I always have a persistent feeling that my friends arent actually there because they like me but rather because they feel bad for me or pity me. I havent ever gotten properly close to girls in fear they will hurt me which is a fear that derived from my past experiences with my stepmum and my real mum. And even if people assure me they care and are there for me, I always feel like they secretly hate me and theyre planning to hurt me or theyre talking about me behind my back. I usually just sit on my bed and cry about these problems and have been having many thoughts that the world would be better without me. I managed to tell my dad I felt worthless but his response was thats normal at your age and youll feel better soon, just speak to people but I cant bring myself to speak to people out of fear of them hating me or me inconveniencing them. Im really unsure of what I can do, and I feel lost, and all these feelings and emotions have only strengthened since lockdown started as I havent spoken to people much and have been alone all the time. And a experience that only strengthened this feeling of loneliness was last night when I was in a call with my friends but they ignored me every time I spoke and I think they forgot I was even there. Im sorry if this is kinda weird or sounds like a rant or if it doesnt make sense, Im just trying to type it up but my head is being weird and my thoughts are fuzzy and I just feel so tired",

    "How depressed do you need to get before you decide you should be off work sick? Im very depressed and its mostly due to my job, which is immensely complicated and the depression means I cant focus on the main work Im doing. I can still otherwise do simple tasks, but the core piece of work Im supposed to be doing, which is huge, urgent and stressing me out beyond belief is something I just cannot focus on and the more I try the more I become depressed. Im trying to figure out if I should be off work sick. The more I fail to get this huge, urgent bit of work done, the more stressed and depressed Ill get, but how long should I continue down this route? I have told my manager and colleagues that I am suffering from depression and that it stops me being able to focus on large, complex work, but the task still needs to be done. They remind me that I can ask for help, but I just cant understand anything, even when explained to me and the task is incredibly urgent.",

We share interest, same humor, honesty have been there since the beginning, we can talk about anything, even shared deeply vulnerable stories and the sex is amazing as well. We seem to be able to connect in a way Ive never tried before and create this space where it is just us. Green flags all the way. I quickly fell madly in love with him ofcourse. I shared my feelings for him about 4 months into it, told him no pressure at all since I wasnt ready for a full blown serious relationship and he didnt either. I have no doubt that he has feelings for me. Non. About 2 months ago he fell deep down into depression. He told me. I told him if there was anything I could do to help? He said maybe. I told him I was there if he needed to talk. He said thank you. Asked him if he wanted to meet up again soon? He said he was feeling so bad and was overwhelmed at work he works a lot. I said no problem, you just write me when the time is better, no pressure and Im not mad. Take your time. He said he would. Its been a month since that last text, and I havent heard anything. My guts tell me to just wait, but I am worried and a little unsure of how to handle this situation.. Should I keep on waiting I am not in a hurry and if Im not going to continue my relationship with him I dont feel like dating at all right now or should I reach out? afraid of preassuring.

I have a hard time focusing on or doing anything, whether it be school or things outside of school. This includes hobbies or being with friends. My grades are piss poor right now, which adds to my guilt and depression. I want to do my work and make my teachers proud, but I havent been able to focus onunderstand the lessons and I lose all of my stuff a lot. Around the age of 11 or 12, I developed severe anxiety and panic attacks. I was constantly in a state of such anxiety that almost anything could set off a panic attack. I would hyperventilate and cry until I threw up, and would occasionally shit my pants in fear. I was also severely depressed I had no energy or motivation to do anything. I would hurt myself every day. Around this time I also realized that I had gender dysphoria and was bisexual. I told my mom about all of this, because as a 12 year old youre supposed to go to your mom about your problems. She shamed me, she blamed me, she screamed at me. I had to threaten to hurt and kill myself to get her to do anything to help me. My panic attacks have since tapered off, and I dont have them as often now. However, my mom thinks I am not trans and that I am straight. I suppressed both my gender and sexuality for years, but my gender dysphoria has come back tenfold. Im too scared to tell her but.. I cant live as a woman. My grades have been pretty not great since 9th grade. Im really smart still, I just have a really hard time paying attention in class and am too depressed to do my assignments. With enough effort not much I can pull As in most of my classes, and at the very worst a low B, but nowadays, I dont have the energy to put out that effort anymore.

Sometimes I dont even want to go outside because I feel like Im too ugly, but thats honestly only when Im feeling down.

Honestly, my mom is the only person that shows me any kind of affection, and it makes me just want to be at home all the time, even though I have friends, they are not really people who I can depend on.

And, Ive struggled for 20 years to fight off very intense anxiety and depression. I have been unable to work since 2014. Ive got a claim for SSDI, but apparently Im not sick enough. SMH I married my high school sweetheart May of 2018. He was the one that got away. I was never happier. After choosing the wrong guys all my life, I finally choose the right guy! Then in October he fell ill with an unknown lung disease. By the 21st of December I lost my love, my best friend he just couldnt breathe anymore. He put up a valiant fight. I was immediately hospitalized in the psych unit. I was overwhelmed with grief. I wanted to die. I wanted to be with him. I even tried several times to make that happen. And to add fuel too the fire, my dad passed away three months after my husband. Im not ashamed to say I was Daddys Little Girl. And I miss him just as much as my husband. So, for a whole year I struggled and fight my depression and anxiety. In that year, I was hospitalized 10 times, for psych and other ailments I have. But sometime after the 1 year mark when he died, I kinda just came out of the fog. I was feeling so much better, reaching out to his mom and other friends. I was so glad that I was gonna beat this. Fast forward to the present. I am an isolater by nature, so this covid19 situation I know I can get through it. I have one good friend and my motherinlaw for support. I keep my appointments with my psychiatrist, and take my meds as prescribed. I have no income, since I have to go through the entire process with Social Security before I can qualify to receive spousal benefits. Basically, what he was earning.

    "What to expect when you share your mental health with your family? I recently shared some parts of my mental health with my family. So my question is this what should I expect them to behave after sharing this with them? My experience telling them wasnt pleasant and I dont know if Im at fault for sharing or if Im at fault for expecting a certain behavior. ampx200B Heres what happened I am 24, female. Ive had depression, anxiety, dissociation and derealisation for over 2 years now, probably had it before but it was only confirmed by a therapist two years ago because thats when I went to see whats wrong with me. ampx200B Nobody knows about this side of me but my ex girlfriend. So recently I told my mom I have anxiety. My family keeps showing at my house randomly to visit and stay for hours and that would cause panic attacks each time because I want expecting their visit or planned for it. So one day I burst and told my mom why Im always upset when they show up like that. all I expect is a call before hand to prepare myself mentally. ampx200B Ive told them about my dissociation and derealisation because they have been nagging for months wanting me to buy a car and drive instead of commuting and refusing to move to a house thats far from work. my mom lives with me so me driving is important to take her places I kept telling them Im not ready and I just need more practice. I took so many lessons and wasted over 1500 learning with no result to the extent I was kicked out of the driving lesson by my instructor because he thought my driving was dangerous So one day they said Im a coward and that I should just go and drive and not let my fear control me. So I shared the reason why I cant drive. They first said theres no such thing as what I mentioned and that I shouldnt diagnose myself with no knowledge. I told them I went to 3 therapist and they all confirmed this. After a moment of silence they said I shouldnt let this stop me from driving. I said no It should stop me because its a danger to my self and the people around me. My sister said ok seek help.",

    "How do I support my girlfriend who is struggling with depression? Hi, first time poster here, I hope this is an appropriate post for this board. My girlfriend is struggling with depression, probably stemming from childhood trauma unstable family situation, regular police presence in the house. She is taking large doses of venlafaxine 225mg for 120lb body weight to cope with her illness, but it can only do so much. She often has problems controlling her anger, which is related to the point of this post, because when she is in a depressed mood, anger is often the only way she can really communicate. She recently had a complete nervous breakdown in the car I was driving, over an argument we had. It ended with her calling an ambulance on herself to be taken to emergency psychiatric care. She is now considering some time in a psychiatric institution for herself. Now here comes my main questions She often has these breakdowns, where she often can only shout and scream, or completely retreat. She describes it as such She can either scream, or say nothing and retreat to sleep for a day. I have found that I am very unhelpful for her in these moments. I am a very careful person, and I think a lot before doing anything. She says she needs guidance and structure in these moments. How can I support her in those moments? I have tried to give her clear instructions in those moments in the past, but it has not worked well. I think my personality type just does not make it very credible if I say Calm down, were doing X now, because I dont behave like that in a noncrisis situation. I think her anger is often a frustration about her inability to deal with her illness. Unfortunately, her behavior in those moments also scares me. So I am even more timid to help her. Not that I am scared that she will hurt me or anything, but I am scared of making it worse. Also, I quickly become frustrated if i try something and it does not work, which is an issue I need to work on. ampx200B TLDR How do I support my depressed girlfriend during a mental breakdown? Anyone out there who can relate to her behavior and knows what works for them? Any advice welcome!",

    "Should I kill myself? I am the most uninteresting person and I feel like I am the only one who puts effort into any of my relationships. Ill call her Kayla. I have actually blocked of so much of my memory of her, like I remember maybe 3 or 4 moments over a year and 8 months or so of dating. We started of pretty good, but I believe we were both immature and didnt know how to set boundaries or handle a relationship. Which is what led to a lot of fighting. I do remember we fought a bit around a year into the relationship because she kept cancelling plans with me to go out and play games. Like I never tried to get in the way of her friendships, but she cancelled our anniversary date, and just a few other dates we set up literally the evening before or the morning of to hang out with friends. I told her that I wanted her to hang out with friends but the constant cancelling plans with me and not trying to reschedule was hurtful. Ahh, a lot of it is coming back now. I would honestly say we were a bit codependent, she relied on me for emotional support as her mother was extremely controlling, I relied on her for my social needs. Not a healthy relationship. We ended up breaking up after growing a bit distant, and at the end she played a bunch of games with me. Her mother didnt want me dating her which was the main reason we broke up. So she told me if I can convince her mom, shed let me get back with her. I didnt do this of course but I was distraught. I felt like I had nothing. I started playing piano in grade 11 but quit while we dated because of the effort it took. Most of my time went towards school and her. I ignored a lot of my friendships more than I should have during the relationship so I was in a terrible spot. It made me realize how unhealthy a person I was. I had struggles reaching out to the 3 friends or so I had because I always questioned whether they liked me. But when we broke up, they were there for me.",

But once Im home, Im utterly depressed, because I have nothing to do. I have hobbies I used to love, but at this point, starting to do something anything at all seems like a tall hill to climb. So I just nap and browse the internetsocial media. Because that doesnt require effort. I used to have passions, like art and music. I used to write, draw, sew, exercise, watch tv, watch movies, and read. I cant seem to focus properly. Ill be trying to read something, but dont understand whats going on. I cant remember anything, either. I cant wake up in the morning. I tried antidepressant medication, but they actually make me 100x worse. So now, I need to find natural ways to get up, do things, find passion. Id like to have a schedule, but every time I try to make a schedule, I cant stick to it. Something is wrong, and I dont know how to fix it or balance myself. Someone could tell me, Just do it.

    "I want to slit my wrists but I know the consequences. So basically at the beginning of the year I started slitting my wrist because I started feeling overwhelming depression after 2019. My mum saw the marks and told me to stop. At the beginning of quarantine my depression took another increase, and for two days I started slitting my wrist again until my mum saw. She demanded that I tell her what was wrong, and I just told her I feel generally depressed all the reasoning behind it is complicated and plus I dont feel comfortable telling her. She asked me if a boyfriend had broken up with me or something, and that definitely wasnt the reason so I assume if she knows Im depressed shell think that. She then demanded that I dont slit my wrists again, and therefore I know that if I do, Ill get into a bunch of crap I dont wanna be in. I really wanna start doing it again Im a horrible person so I deserve it and hurting myself makes me feel better for some reason.

    "i had to say goodbye to my sweet boy today after finding out yesterday cancer is ravaging his body. the vet said he has never seen anything like what was shown on those scans, that my sweet maximus was a very very sick little boy. the inside of his spleen was supposed to look like peanut butter, but instead it looked like chunky jelly with chunks and lumps he could not identify. his body had developed multiple tumors, which were cancerous. he had gone into tumor lysis crisis meaning that a large amount of the cancer cells that were comtained in these tumors died, and released their cancerous contents into his blood. they were killing his red blood cells and destroying the ability to regenerate any at all. his stomach had bloated 3x its normal size, even though it was just later in the day and yesterday morning it had looked fine. the vet discouraged us from treatment because he didnt see any possible way maximus could recover putting him on treatment would only prolong his suffering and ensure he passed painfully. which is cruelly ironic, as putting him on treatment would keep my suffering at bay. but i have to do right by my boy. hes been through too much and endured more than i can imagine, he was brought into this world in pain and i promised him when i brought him home he would leave it in love. i had to keep that promise. i love him more than it seems like my heart can handle, and making the right decision for him is the absolute utterly wrong decision for me. we got the vet this morning and despite not moving except to lift his head the past few days, he trotted off away from the building. i believe in the deepest place of my heart he knew what we were there for, and he was scared. he wouldnt let me turn him around back toward it, and the most he would take was two steps toward the building and then sit back down. i sat down with him and just sobbed. the thought of not having that big brown baby rips my heart into shreds and pierces my soul. we finally got him inside after i just sat with him and talked to him for about 15 minutes. ive never wanted to simply wait in a waiting room longer, but they called us right back.",

The girl I thought could become this, my old coworker, isnt going to be that for me. Im not mad. But it hurts a lot. I miss her and wish we couldve been closer. I really thought we could be super close best friends. Im so lonely, its like choking. The grief is so much. Insomnia is worst its ever been. Seeing a therapist. On medication. Not suicidal. So dont mention it please. Im so tired of people giving me suicide hotline numbers and saying see a therapist. I feel pushed away when that happens now. Im so tired of being ignored and invisible. I dont know whats so wrong with me for people to not want to be around me. I love life and living. But this is so painful and hard this year.

    "I can feel happy some days and other days I want to die. Hello, Ive 22F struggled with my mental health since I was young, I was bullied when I was a kid and developed social anxiety because of it. Then I became depressed in my teenage years, but got better when I was 20. Ive never been good at interacting with people, due to my anxiety I find it really hard to talk spontaneously to people, but at the same time I can get defensive over anything, like I feel people are attacking me or trying to make fun of me but in reality theyre just joking around. A lot of people dont like me because of that, I seem really mean but Im not, I wish I could be friends with people like a normal person but I just cant. Lately Ive been having good days and bad days, but exaggerated. When Im having a good day I feel amazing, Im productive and do a lot of things. But in my bad days I feel way too bad, I was clean from self harm for 4 years and I did it again like a week ago. When I feel bad I also cant stop thinking I want to die, I feel like no one will ever like me, Ill never get a job because I run away from good opportunities because of my anxiety.

I can act all extroverted and social if the situation demands it. I come from a broken home with divorces, drugalcoholverbal and physical abuse. But I still consider my childhood to have been good.

I know its not the right thing to do, but it would just feel sooo good not to feel like a useless piece of shit who cares about no one. Who sees no future or no reason in moving on. Who gets hung up on all his failures and shortcomings. Tried several different antidepressants in increasing doses over the course of 3 years. Only gave me side effects o I quit out of spite. Seen numerous doctors, psychiatrists and therapists. Only felt mocked and not taken seriously so I quit out of spite. Been admitted to the psychiatric ward sry, google translate, a good place to get depressed by the way, but I talked my way out of there after a week. Ive tried quitting my job. Quitting my band. Quitting my girlfriend. Exercising. Eating heathier.",

I was caught and got scolded badly by my father first time in my life It was one of the worst memory that still stick with me throughout my life and always appear when Im depressed in my highschool years I cheated in my exam over and over because I have been trying for 9 years yet my Malay languages isnt improving so I started cheating in my exam in my final two years in highschool. I was caught and got embarrassed and got scolded by my teachers I know what I did is totally wrong, then why did I do it? Truth is I dont know why I did it. Worst of all I already knew this would happen and I also know that cheating wont benefit me in any way. Also I tend to lie alot in my life, it has di e down alot but once in awhile I still do.

Ive had one relationship with a girl, that eventually ended. I loved her but after that I couldnt feel anything for anyone and no, not even her. I just ended up obsessing over her, even if I didnt feel a thing. Really tried after I started to get over her, and even tried with another girl, but even with all that I managed to bosses with her as well, and got called a creep and that I harassed her.

He just smells bad and no one really knows why. So they always joke about him dying even though they know it hurts me. Ive gotten to the point where I dont know what Ill do when he dies. I have a therapist but I dont really have anyone else I confide in about these things besides my wife but she makes jokes too. The last time I had a dog die it almost killed me.

If you guys have any advice on somethings I can do to prepare and to handle this situation that would be amazing. Thank you all for all the support.",
    "Low functioning depression The more time passes, the more stressed I am, the harder it is to focus, and it all ends up being a great, vicious circle. It is the beginning of November, I need to send the university apps as soon as possible, and what am I doing? After spending my whole day laying in bed, sleeping and crying, I am writing on reddit for help as I am on a verge of a mental breakdown, once again, for two months and counting. And yes, I am aware there are worse problems one can encounter in life. And yes, I am very much aware that issues like these can be easily solved by investing a bit of willpower, but I do not have any more strength to do so. I need advice. Any advice. A change of perspective. Anything. Please, anything. I do not have much time, I am feeling worse as seconds pass, my anxiety has spread out on many different aspects of my life. Consequently I dont do anything, I dont sleep well, I dont exercise, I dont eat well. Ive become a nihilistic, lazy person who is anxious about almost everything. Again. Every part of my body hurts every day, as this is how I usually react to procrastination and low productivity. I know I need just the smallest amount of strength to begin my work and stop all this, but I cannot find it on my own. Please help me, because I know if I mess this up I will never fully recover. I am so stressed and so scared. Please give me any advice you have, anything that you think may help. Some plan, something new, anything. Please. I cannot do this anymore and I cannot live like this anymore.",

    "Depression or just “messed up” Hi, Ever since I was 17 15 years ago my life has been crap. I had a long term boyfriend who treated me like crap for 12 years, lied to me, stole from me and was emotionally abusive to me. I had a child with him and finished with him 3 years ago. I then met someone, he was ok in the beginning but then he started purposely saying things to hurt me like saying Id be the worst person in the world to have a kid with, how hed never marry me, and also call me a fat ct Im not actually fat he apologised for all of that saying he only said it because he wanted to hurt me. but recently, hes started lying to me and then wed get in to a fight and hed say Im mentally sick and that Im really messed up and obviously have loads of insecurities. For the past 7 years Ive felt SO low! My mood changes so quickly, i get moody quite often, I am constantly doubting myself and after the recent lies from my current partner Ive come to realise I cant trust him or believe a word he says anymore. Ive also been having bad thoughts not so much suicidal, more that I think it would be so much easier for people if I just died In my head Ive put in place what would happen to my child if I did die. Am I depressed or just messed up from my past? Im so stubborn I dont want to talk to a doctor in fear they would laugh in my face and say Im just a waste of time. I dont want to speak to family in fear that they would pity me. I dont want to speak to friends because Id feel embarrassed. I cant talk to work because its such a stressful job theyd only worry that I may end up taking time off work! I dont know what to do anymore.",

    "I'm so tired I was tired of it all, I was overwhelmed to the point where small mishaps with homework could break me. This continued for months, I just felt awful constantly it felt like there was always something small that would show up and throw me off again. I remember another break down about two months ago when I was out seeing colleges, I just stayed up awake for hours one night crying to myself and venting to some friends. Something about how I tried to hard to have things be better, I spent so long trying to draw, and write and do everything that I enjoy while balancing school but it just wouldnt work, it kept getting worse instead of better. I was just tired, I just wanted it to stop, I just wanted to be happy but it only got worse. It felt like there was no reason for any of this, I was just here feeling like shit for no reason, I wanted it to end so badly. Around this time the school announced their full time in person plan, leaving my parents and me too fight about whether or not I should go back in to school. The same arguments happened and eventually I was sent in again. The first day back was some of the most intense anxiety Ive ever felt, just pure feer and overwhelmingness about the very uncomfortable situation I was in. That leads me to now, the most recent random period of stress that makes me finally say I cant do this anymore. Three weeks ago review for the AP Lit exam started a standardized test final for a literature class, known for being very poorly designed and I realized our teacher taught my class next to nothing about literature the whole year and I was on my own to prepare. The whole overwhelming thing happened again, it just felt like my whole life would revolve around this pointless exam for about an entire month, leaving me with no time to do the few things that actually make me happy anymore. That night I went in the kitchen and just held a knife, I just sat on the floor crying for a while, I know I wouldnt do anything but the thought of it alone terrified me. I wanted it to stop, I just wanted this awful string of events to end already, yet whenever I got scared or overwhelmed all I was told was to get through it to summer, but I couldnt.",
    "I’m not worried about getting COVID-19, I’m worried about the effects of social distancing and the possibility of quarantine First of all, I want to say that I am incredibly grateful to be young and have an uncompromised immune system. I am very fortunate in this sense. However, I am worried about the effects of things like social distancing and isolation on mental health. That is not to say that I disagree with these measures whatsoever, but like so many other people, being isolated is damaging to my wellbeing. My question is as a college student living in a dorm without a roommate, how can I cope and what are some things I can do in my newfound time from my room? Note I have 3 weeks of remote classes after break. I could stay home longer but I feel that would be even more damaging to my psyche.",
    "Awful nightmares and bad sleep So Ive 23f been diagnosed with depression since 18. Meds only semi work and i have a few people i know i can count on as support but over the last couple months Ive been experiencing extreme night terrors. What makes them worse is how realistic they feel, as Im sort of semi conscious when they happen. It makes it harder for me to distinguish whats real and what isnt. Someone im incredibly close to saw me have one, apparently i was crying and thrashing like crazy and when i finally snapped out of it i was a mess for ages even as they held me and tried to bring me back from the horrible head space i was in. Its made me reluctant to sleep as I live at home with parents and sleep alone and when it happens i end up getting no sleep as Im terrified of it happening again so wont try to go back to sleep. Ive tried adapting the mentality of suck it up and forcing myself back to bed after it happens when Im on my own but I struggle to get out of that head space and still lose a good hour or so of sleep before i finally feel comfortable enough to sleep. I was wondering if theres anything i can do when im on my own to calm and ground myself quicker after it happens?",
    "I think I have genuine depression. I was hit by a drunk driver in November. I got some bruises, shock, and my car was deemed total loss, but it still works just fine thankfully. Since my accident, I went for a run in a violent snowstorm in St. Louis, slipped and fell on my back and hit the back of my head on the ground. It hurt a bit but I continued running. The knots on my head healed up eventually. Ive seen like 5 different accident scenes around the areas since my accident back on 1122. These past like 5 days, Ive felt incredibly emotionally unsettled. Im not in control of my emotions, and I feel so emotional inside my head, I cant speak that well. Today I feel is the worst because Im extremely emotionally unstable, I feel out of control of my emotions, and just powerfully depressed. Ive noticed Ive been waking up around 6630AM or so every morning even though I want to sleep more and refresh my mind, brain chemistry. Im going to Finland in a week or so, for a week or so. People have been cold and rude to me in public recently as well, as well as over the phone unfortunately. Ive been trying to keep marching on, but I dont feel interested, lively, confident, and vibrant like I usually do. Do you think this is depression genuinely or something else medically? Tell me your thoughts and thank you for listening and for your concern and human empathy. I care about you and your feelings too. I do hope you have a wonderful happy new year for yourselves. .",
    "Achievements mean nothing So, I just finished my thesis presentation, which I was netvous about not fully done but one of the last stops before full on submission. I got praised by both the professors there who told me my thery was unique and interesting for my field. They said that it looks like its already around passing level and I can take the extra month to make it even stronger. I was happy enough to hit the gym and do a full workout routine. Then I came home and its like all that just went away. I got the thoughts back in my head that my research field is useless, Ill never have a good job when Im done, Im just mediocre, I screwed up my life, I missed so many opportunities...

    "Should I kill myself? I am the most uninteresting person and I feel like I am the only one who puts effort into any of my relationships. My other 2 friends ended up dating and stopped talking to most people becsuse of that. At the start of 2020 after the breakup, I started getting into philosophy actually and began focusing on including stoicism and other ways of being into my life. Just accepting that things go wrong but thats okay. Its very hard and I obviously have yet to achieve it but I wanted to learn to be happy even if I didnt have everything I want. I began journaling what I did and didnt like about myself and tried to become a better person. This awkard phase went on for a while, I would talk to my cousin for comfort. We would call and game, though honestly, I lost interests in games. I started craving to play the piano again and by 2021 I decided to get back into it. I practice a lot and can play a couple chopin pieces, but I still am not very good so its not something I can like show off to people. Also I became incredibly more awkward, in trying to better myself, I became super apologetic and passive. I struggle to joke around because I dont want to offend, or I just feel awkward. I never know what to say, and I am always trying to think like is this what a good person does. Which inches closer to today. I struggle so hard with making friends, I dont have much interesting skills. I dont have much hobbies besides piano, business, and like history. I am not super funny. I am awkwrd and uncomfortable with new people. I am needy. I am dependent on social interaction yet I get none. I am not as good looking as I once was. I feel so unattractive. Like why would anyone want to be friends with me, and no matter how hard I try to get out there or be interesting, it seems I am always the one putting all of the effort to relationships. I am the one chasing, and no one is giving me any thought. I actually am in a relationship though, we started dating in april.",
    "Two Faced People - Need Advice So basically, today in college we had a 15 minute break and my mate and I went out of college we went to the shops. We came back at the end of the break and as soon as we walked in this girl said speaking of the devil. We were just speaking about you and she was saying about my mate. I sat down on my seat and I got a message from my mate telling me that they were chatting shit about me, these two girls. They were going on about how I was ugly and how I cant get any girls and stuff. It didnt bother me about what they said, but should I have said something back, Im not really looking for drama especially right now where I have a situation going on with a girl. I just want some advice on what I shouldve done or next time if I catch them talking about me. By the way, I didnt say anything to them girls, they said this randomly.

    "Talk about depression in job interview? Hey guys, Ive been subject to a lot of depression episodes recently, which really sucks because Im currently actively looking for a job. I started kind of taking care of my depression a few months ago, but I still experience really bad days suicidal thoughts and such. The things is, before fully dedicating myself to finding a job, I decided to take a few months off. This means I would allow myself to put my job research on hold while really taking measures to work on my depression for the first time in my life. The problem Im facing now during job interviews is the dreaded question But what have you been doing for the past 5 months? I see no job experience, no nothing. with the nice tone of voice Have you been doing fuck all? I was thus wondering, what would a good answer be to that sort of question? Cus Im not sure giving the depression background during an interview would really help my case, and on another end, Ive not been doing fuck all, just not what they want to hear. ampx200B Im really lost on this point, cus I really want to start working again. I feel like it would be the next step toward winning over this freaking depression.

At this point, Im just tired. And if Im tired already, I dont know how will I carry on for the next 30ish years of my short life shorter than most, anyway. I just want to be loved.

    "I can’t feel anything, no matter what I do, I can’t feel anything physically or mentally I am a 17 yo male, who comes from an extremely abusive household, and Ive recently noticed that my feelings are almost non existent. I also cant feel any pain, some might think its a gift but its a fucking curse. Im numb to the core and I just want to be normal again. I havent eaten in 3 days because if I try to I throw up. Ive been getting 4 hours of sleep regularly and cant physically sleep longer than that. My father used to beat me and force me to torture rodents with him. I remember one time he made me drown a possum in a garbage can and hack a squirrels limbs off. By the time I was 8 years old I had already known how to disassemble, clean, and reassemble a .38 caliber pistol. My father was a narcissist, and I was his golden child. If I ever did anything wrong I was told I was making our family look bad. Id get a hell of a beating if I even said anything out of line, and my mother was constantly in and out of hospitals from her accidents. I believe my father is a large part of why I am feeling the way I am recently. I noticed I stopped feeling emotion when I had a stroke last March. I wasnt scared, or worried, I was calm, and didnt even feel anything. Even after I had almost lost my ability to play guitar, I wasnt sad or scared. Ever since then, its just gotten worse and worse. My girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me and all I had to say to her was ok. Honestly it was probably best for her, I dont know if I can feel love anymore, so whats the point of trying. I recently noticed I cant physically feel pain when I was trying to fix the shingles on my roof. I missed with the hammer and smacked my hand right on the thumb, but I didnt feel anything. Just to test my theory, I smacked the back of my hand full force. I heard the crunching of bone, but still felt no pain. I dont know whats wrong with me.",

    "Just need to talk to anyone So I have been a part of this subreddit for idk how long, but never posted anything because I felt like my problems are not important. But now I want to post something. I actually have typed this post out several times this week but always ended up deleting it. I dont want to be a burden to anyone. Im gonna start with what happened today. This story has nothing bad happening but it caused me mental pain. Im typing this out because the four hours I spent with my fiancé has been the longest I have felt happy this week and I just need to talk to anyone right now. Me and my fiancé went to the gym this morning. He had to pick me up due to we both still with our parents and havent told anyone about our engagement we want to surprise them and are waiting to by financial set. We went to the gym worked out for an hour or two then we went out to do some errands. I was bringing my resume to places applied to and my fiancé was my ride. After that he got on the freeway and we were just driving and making jokes. I was telling him a funny story about a quest I did in a game Im playing. Then I got a phone call from my mom. She wanted to know where I was and when Im going to be back. Now I know this is seems like a red flag but she only asked because she had to get a new work uniform and my other siblings were going with her and no will be home. That doesnt seem bad but my moms stepdad lives with us and he is unable to much he can walk and stuff but has a hard time remembering things. So someone has to be home with him. I said ok and we started to head back. This when I noticed that my fiancé was upset. I asked whats wrong, it turns out that he had a surprise for me. He was taking to a sushi place that he promised to take a while back. He also had plans for the whole day for us but wanted to surprise me with it. I started feeling like I ruined the whole day. His plans and the way he described it made it sound like today was gonna be the most perfect dateday.",

    "I ( 26 female ) have decided to take care of my severely depressed younger brother (20m ) by letting him move in with me last week and need some tips. Hey all ! I am new to the group and a Canadian I would like some advice. This is a VERY long post so bare with me. I took on basically taking care of my severely depressed younger brother. I am 26 and my brother is 20. I have been moved out for 4 years, my brother has been under child protective services from the overly toxic environment at home. For some background mom is an addict  alcoholic  and dad definitely has mental illness and severe emotional disregulation and is severely controlling and overall unhealthy and manipulative  violent outbursts , tantrums, controlling .they are both functional for the most part but very terrible to be around and our entire family became severely dysfunctional as a result and has suffered a lot. In the past I have had reactive depression but am better now here is what I experienced  Basically I can get depressed when sad events happen like breakup death or I would experience severe anxiety when I lived with my parents  to say the least  . I got depressed and severely melancholic  experience debiliating guilt ans selfhatred  and could not function well for months years after certain events happened so I relate to my brother and understand him very well. However, the difference between my brother and I is that I sought help and still speak to someone every 2 weeks.. My brother was always forced into help by CPS for example. He also is a highschool dropout 2x because of the home environment and I know that the social stigma that comes with this has really weighed down on his selfesteem. He is very smart  beat a Canadian chess champion at chess  but he never takes compliments and feels like his depression has altered his ability to retain information  poor memory, brain fog  . He is VERY hard on himself and I almost feel like he would rather stay depressed as a way to selfpunish himself for dropping out of highschool  he even told me he feels like he does not deserve anything good because he is in his own words a  loser .. and feels like he is tired of being alive. Not exactly suicidal in that he does not intent to kill himself but he is fed up of living so could very well do something dangerous if this continues .",

Mirrors are a source of unhappiness for me and even if I try to escape my homes mirrors I will often open the camera app of my phone to look at me and take pictures of my face because I dont feel comfortable with what I see. I have hundreds of selfies just to look and to analyze my face and I always get angry if I dont like what I see.

In August I left a very toxic relationship and also lost my job. I am now married but I still havent found employment. I have applied to so many jobs and gone to so many interviews but they never go anywhere. I already feel like a failure because I lost my job and it makes me feel even worse not being able to find employment. My depression has gotten almost to the same place I was in back in July. My marriage is falling apart because Im so stressed out and depressed but dont receive and real positive support from my husband. I feel like Im just meant to be alone and will never be loved for who I am. I just want to be happy and not feel like Im a burden to everyone around me. I dont know what to do anymore.",
    "I need help. I have been going through some stuff and its really weighing on me. Me and my ex broke up about 67 months ago, she blocked me and wont even talk to I havent tried in months so dont worry Im not trying to stalk her anyways, I needed a fresh start, I moved 3 states away and now Im completely on my own, I dont have any friends yet since Ive only been here about a month and it is. HARD. Almost every night. I dream about her, every day I think about her. I have gotten rid of everything that I had from her pictures included but I cant stop thinking about her. I dont have health insurance yet so I cant get therapy, but Im working on it. But I need something to get me through, no matter how many girls Im with or anything it doesnt help, I just need some advice on what to do until I can get professional help, Im constantly depressed. I always feel like shit. Help me... please",
    "I ( 26 female ) have decided to take care of my severely depressed younger brother (20m ) by letting him move in with me last week and need some tips. I booked him an appointment with a family doctor on Friday  tomorrow  and I spoke to my own therapist who recommended me a program to recommend to the doctor for my brother. They do a more intensive followup for mental health adults that lasts 2 years and they work at the patient s pace... My fear is he will give up or not accept the help even though he told me he is open to it last Sunday. Yesterday he started getting hesitant again saying he didnt want to do the work but also he is aware he needs to get better.. What my concerns are  1. Basically I know that I have what it takes to help him and objectively he is better off with me that he is with my parents and since he has nowhere else to go I wont let him starve or end up on the steet. But, I want to know how to get past my own emotions and fears and anxieties regarding this entire situation and NOT identify with his depression. 2. I want to set healthy boundaries also where I dont get caught up in saving him because I already feel like Im trying to do that... but I dont know what that would look like... should I give him a contract or make him sign a promise to himself  what do I do if after a year he has not progressed ? Should there be consequences  not punishments but, a different recommendation ? I dont want to end up taking care of.him forever I want him to heal with me and get back on his feet. 3. Moreover, I dont want his depression to trigger me and I dont want his negativity  not shaming him he is just very depressed and sick and needs help but his depression makes him so negative about everything  to bring me down, I want to keep pushing for a better life for myself and my brother without the negativty bringing me down as I worked so hard to get to a somewhat surface level healthy mindset  I say this because I.myself can get easily triggered and spiral if things feel to overwhelming especially when it comes to my family  ...",
    "Shitty New Years Worst new year ever My ex fiancé decided to added me on snap and make me relive everything until 3 am when I literally just got over a few days ago? Its been 6 months of radio silence, an email from me, calls with no answer. We were raising my son together his he was 5 months old and we heard nothing from him. His excuse was the same one that he used all throughout our relationship to not be there for us work is killing him. He owns a pizza restaurant.. and hes a control freak so he basically does everything himself even though he pays employees then stressed himself out because hes doing everything and working 16 hours a day. It ended with me asking for 1 hour a week of couple counselling because I know I have issues but he does too and needs to be able to make at least one hour a time a week for his family if it was ever going to work. His message was  I miss you. happy New Years and then from there it turned into him going on about his how shitty his life is without me.. even though apparently I was the reason he had no money ever and now its the same. I live off of less than half of his income, supporting my son in a two bedroom as opposed to his one bed and somehow I have savings, even though I do have some bad spending habits  fast food delivery , and grocery delivery because sometimes Im too anxious to leave the house and I need to cook for my son. Anyway so that was a mess. And then my friend with benefit that I was falling for.. that I thought maybe felt the same because he was driving an hour to see me, bringing me starbucks, offering to teach me how to drive and cook better, talking about maybe meeting my kid in the future, talking about taking me out clubbing after covid cause Ive missed out being a young mom with no help had a New Years party.. didnt even think to invite me and posted on his snap grinding with some girl 10x hotter than me.. so I hate myself so much for thinking maybe I was special, maybe I meant something to someone in 2020 nope..",
    "Tips on not distancing friends? Also, what options are available to get therapy with your parents being able to intervene? I been in a downward spiral. I have had forceful intrusive thoughts of suicide. It like someone nagging you, but you just think of those words over and over. This is the worst its ever been. My parents arent allowing me to get therapy since my mom said nothing is wrong with you, you can not go because they may give you medicine. I understand she is worried and doesnt want crazy written on my personal record. her words not mine I was looking forward to join a free program called better hope, but she said there wasnt enough knowledge. I had a serious break down where I talked to my friends, and the comforted me. I promised them after this I wont need a shoulder, so I wont bother yall. I was hopeful that my mom would green light it. So, now Im just need help, but I pushed everyone away. We still talk, but it feels wrong for me to unload. I been feeling really selfish from the times I did try to talk to them.",
    "To everyone who actually took time to read this, thank you for caring for me, a random stranger who probably doesn't deserve getting much help anyways. My mom just got high blood pressure today. And its my fucking fault. Since I dont live with my mom or my dad, I live with my married sister and her family. My parents visit me a few times a year, and recently, my mom was able to come over to Cali since the state she lived in was going to close due to Covid, and she wanted to take advantage of this time and spend more time with me. She comes over, goes into quarantine for 14 days, and everything peachy. Well, when my mom realized I was still hurting myself, she got really concerned, and made it her lifes mission to help me get out of this depression, which I had lied about and said Im fine. Dear Mom, I want to let you know that I really love and appreciate you, but for some reason, I just cant bring myself to tell you. Im sorry. Within the several days, my mom really tried to help me. But I was always bitchy towards her, saying I was fine, and I yelled at her. My mom, she cried sometimes, but she just didnt let me see her doing that. But I could always hear it. And being me, I couldnt swallow down the part of me that hated her, for leaving me and making me grow up faster than all my friends, who had happy families and happy parents, and had the love and emotional support they needed from their own. I was always the one that stuck out, who had to depend on friends instead of my guardians, because they always insisted they were right, and I was wrong. I could never bring myself to talk to the people who supposedly loved me because I always feel like theyre lying, that its their obligation to take care of me, and that they only view me as a waste of space and money and so much time. I got depression around the age of 11, but I just never bothered to get myself help until I was close to really cracking down from all the stress and anger Id hold in from all my encounters with my sister and her husband.",
    "Let's be realistic I stand at the gateway between being stuck in my head and living in reality. You could imagine it like an arched doorway, about 12 feet tall. The door itself is made of rocks, placed almost like bars. The support frame is metal, cold, blue. On the inside, behind the door, its cold, its empty, its black. Filled with images if the past, things that I regret, pain, scars. There are two chains on the floor, not far from where I stand. Those chains were what I used to rattle to summon or conjure back the moments I feel I missed. Like opportunities that had passed me by, like love lost by the way side, like all the memories I just cant seem to let go, like all the people Ive lost along this road. But on the other side there is a light thats beaming bright. I can feel the warmth of the air brush my sides and I feel the urge to come running. Like its calling out my name, like I no longer need to be ashamed of who I am today, like everything Ive ever known has a chance to change. But my biggest struggle is in letting go. My biggest fear of losing control, yet I just need to find my way home, I dont want to be trapped here forever, inside the cold, growing abyss. Reminiscing all the opportunities I missed. I dont want to die here alone, yet Im so afraid to move forward, as I navigate this dark night of the soul. Sometimes its hard enough just to breathe, as I feel the light taking over me. All the damage hidden underneath brought to life, im forced to see and the well behind my eyes, it opens up, it opens wide. I can feel the tears stuck behind of all the pain Ive forced myself to hide. So I speak to you in riddles, could it be Im just a boy inside? I know Im stuck here in the middle, too afraid to step into the light.",

I want to have fun with him and I want to be around people, but I have no friends. I mean, I know people, but like I said, I am in a really bad situation and have learned that I have zero support.

    "I feel like my therapist can be patronizing at times and it made me feel worse I told my therapist how i basically gave up on my future and any hopes of me living an normal life. Like having an education or getting married to someone worthy or being a valuable productive member of society. I said i just wanted to live a peaceful life with my mom for as long as i can and then just... i dont know. She said it felt like i was kinda exaggerating it. And I know i normally overthink what people say but i just left the session feeling even more empty and annoying. Its crazy how depressing picturesvideos or self harm pictures dont get me triggered at all but shit like this does. I dont really know what i can do.

    "About ready to ghost my mom? My mother is a 20 year TBI survivor due to domestic abuse. As such, her mental standing isnt nearly what it might have been. She has severe memory loss, and personality... inconsistencies. Ive been trying to do as much as I can for her, but lately Im feeling more and more drained. I bought her a cell phone because shes never home long enough to warrant a landline. Ive also replaced it several times when it breaks because she doesnt know what a soft touch is. However, this is where Im starting to lose hope. She enrolled in school, which Im proud of her for. She turns her phone off per teacher requirements, but never remembers to turn it back on. She texts me most nights, and I can almost recite her texts verbatim. However, as soon as she sends her text, she turns it back off. My five year old even knows what grandma does is hurtful. My wife has told her that shes gonna call grandma, and my daughter asked, Why? Her phones off anyway. I can go a week, easily, without physically hearing her voice. Im about ready to just delete her number from my phone and ignore her texts, maybe shell eventually get the hint. I feel like its a catch 22... if I keep her number itll just be a reminder that she only wants to talk when its convenient for her, but if I delete her and show that Im upset itll piss off the rest of my family. I dont know what to do any more. How do I handle someone who is making absolutely no attempt to meet me halfway? Its like she doesnt care about me or my family any more.",

I want to feel loved. I want to matter to someone. I want to stop feeling like this, but I feel like it might be too late now. Its been over 10 years since she told me these things.

I cant help it, and I dont know why I do it however my mum always says to me dont be like that, stop it, you dont wanna look weird. But I cant fucking help it.

The sub decided that Im a major asshole, and thats the fair ruling. Multiple times Ive been called rude, mean, even lacking in empathy. I hate myself for it. I dont want to be like this. I want to be a good person. But I cant because I dont understand how. I have autism. I see the world much differently than everyone else. I have no idea why people do the things they do, and I dont think Ill ever understand it. Theyll tell at me for my behavior and I never understand why what Im doing is wrong, even when I explain myself. The AITA post kind of broke the camels back for me. I posted because I just wanted to make sure that I wasnt being mean, and... well, I was. Bigtime. People were telling me I was an asshole to the bone, ungrateful, manipulative, etc. One person said Douche alert! with red siren emojis. Another said that Id lose all of my friends. Im a monster and Im not even aware of it. Even after reading all the replies, I still cant understand why Im so mean. But I am. Honestly, Im just considering suicide at this point.

    "Should I Admit Myself to a Mental Hospital? 19, male, if that helps any. For the past three or four years Ive been struggling with major depressive spells but this most recent one has been going on since March of last year and its really taking its toll. Im living with my abusive parents who constantly remind me of how shitty I am, college is a nogo because of my finances and performance in high school, and I dont really have an outlet to find friends. None of the people I have in my life seem to care at all about my mental or physical health and only want me around when theyre feeling down or lonely. I feel like Im a side character in my own story and havent wanted to live for a while now. Last night I came the closest I ever have to suicide but I just barely didnt have the guts to do it.

    "Is this depression or something else? I noticed my bf had been acting off kind of aloof and withdrawn lately but every time I asked he said he was ok and just tired. Last night I asked again and he said hes ok but when he got home he told me that he doesnt feel right mentally like if something is off. He just wants to lock himself in his room all the time and he said its been a few months like this but that he is just now noticing it. He said he has low sexual attraction and Isnt in the mood much and is disgusted with the thought of sex but still loves me but its just more pure? Now hes had little bouts like this before and so I asked if its like the other times and he said no that he feels just blank. It sounds a lot like depression but I am not sure. Ive told him that he should go to the doctorphysiologist to get this checked in the past I almost got him to go in the past but the office in his network in my town did not have any appointments until several months down the road which is crazy IMO but he can be very stubborn on this. He usually gets out of them eventually but I get really worried and concerned for him and I dont want him to suffer with this. I wish I could just make it go away. Im here because I need help in determining if this is depression or something else and asking for your advice on things we can do to get him help  Im going to try again for the doctor  phycologist but I know its going to be difficult to get him to do this practically and things he can start doing that can help him get out of this. Today Im planning to get him out of the house and walk a nature trail we like photography and stuff and take photos and get him kinda grounded in a way. Idk if this will help but Im willing to do anything. Please Id really love some insight and help.",
    "I don't know what else to title this... depressed 🤷‍♀️ Just got off the phone with my mom. She said I sounded insane. At first I was talking a mile a minute, then I was crying, then angry. I feel out of wack. Ive had depression before but covid is definitely making it way worse. Im a substitute teacherrecent graduate. I dont have any jobs because teachers have been online where I am so I currently have zero income. I can barely afford to live. I dont have any good friends. My 2 best friends live in another city and they tend to screen my calls. Just out of a selfish lack of desire to talk to me. They have boyfriends and babies so they dont need me like I need them. Ive been so lonely. I was dumped back in November. Thought about dating again over Christmas. Met someone nice but Im so bipolar maybe clinically, Ive had my suspicions right now that Im not even a healthy person to date. One second Im seizing the day, full face of makeup, exercising and ready for a date, the next second Im canceling, crying, laying in bed watching movies and hating myself like an empty shell. Before you say get therapy or look into being diagnosed with bipolar, the reason I dont is 1. Cant afford therapy and 2. Because of everything with covid, being dumped, having no income, having no friends, I truly do think this could just be a situational depression with manic tendencies due to boredom. I dont know what to do though. My mom said go date to make friends  thats not how dating works. Then she told me to move home, well I dont wanna be stuck with my family like a 25 year old loser. I just wish my life was better, I want to be living it instead of crying. Could use some support or advice or even just be listened to since noone else does. Thank you",

    "How can I (28f) help my Mum (56f) who is depressed and considering suicide. My Mum has struggled with severe depression ever since her early teens. She has been on a variety of antidepressants on and off for many years and has attempted suicide to the best of my knowledge twice before. She has never kept up with therapy of any sort as she doesnt believe it works. Previously when she fell into a depressive state she would become incredibly pessimistic and irritable, withdrawn, sleep long hours  really just your average symptoms of depression. In recent times over the last 6 months her behaviour has escalated to the point where I am deeply concerned that she will attempt suicide again She doesnt socialise. She has always had a small social group but is now not even engaging in the two things she had been keeping up with for years daily gym and a monthly book club and refuses to do anything new due to the cost. She hates her job and her coworkers, but will not look for other employment because she considers herself too old to get employment elsewhere. Her hatred of her workplace has escalated to the point where she will literally just leave, without advising anyone, and go home to bed. She justifies this as they wouldnt notice me if i was there anyway. Previously she has always had an incredibly strong work ethic, she wouldnt miss a day ever! She is unwilling to stay on antidepressants for extended periods. She doesnt like that they make her gain weight 5kgs OR shes feels that they have done their job and stops taking them cold turkey. This particular behaviour has been an ongoing problem for as long as I can remember but now she wont even consider making an appointment to get a script. She is sending nasty texts and emails to her siblings and cousins, accusing them of imagined petty insults towards her and reacting disproportionately when they tell her that she is acting inappropriately and needs to seek help, she believes they are just trying to get rid of her. Previously they had a friendly but distant relationship without regular contact.",

    "Meds helped for a short period of time, but now I have no energy again, and can't do things. Any advice? Long story short I was diagnosed a few months ago, but was in denial because I wasnt actually sad about life, suicidal, etc. I started taking SSRIs LexaproEscitalopram and got a taste of what things could be like. For once, I had all the energy I needed. I didnt spend forever in bed or on the couch deliberating when I wanted to do something, took five minutes to just pull myself up. I no longer felt like I was fighting the weight of my entire body to do simple tasks. After 2 weeks I decided to drink, and thats when it went downhill. For 9 days, I was without energy, spent hours on the couch watching TV each day, not getting up to do much besides work. I doubled my dose, then for a few days it got better. Energy was back, I was doing things, etc. But then it went back to normal. To be clear, Im still not depressed in the classical sense of having negativity about life. I have hope for the future, overall Im pretty happy with where I am. However, I miss having the energy I had. I miss being able to actually work towards my goals and not feel exhausted by basic chores. My mind would go on autopilot, and I didnt have to constantly make decisions to preserve energy. Any suggestions on what I should do next? Ive been on Lexapro for 4 weeks, with a small gap last week where I didnt take it for 2 days straight. Im not sure whether I should seek other meds, keep on my current ones, or even look for other factors when it comes to regaining my energy. Im goign to book a doctors appointment and discuss options, but I wanted to know if anyone else had similar issues, and what theyve done.",
    "Unmotivated to do anything besides laying down. I don't want to live like this I F22 get up in de morningafternoon and I watch Netflix. Constantly interrupting my series my being on my phone, so not even enjoying that but I cant stop. I dont work out anymore, I barely go outside, I barely eat, Ive lost so much weight. Im too lazy to even look for a therapist or reply to some people on WhatsApp. Im currently not working bc it had become impossible to do my job bc of my depression. Ive tried working out and hanging out with friends. But I hate working out at home, and I still feel depressed. Crying while Im working out. And then feeling hopeless that it doesnt make me feel any better bc it always used to. When Im with friends I feel annoyed or empty. I dont enjoy anything anymore. Which scared me. Please dont give me advice about how I should just pick up a book or go outside and work out. Or meditating or journaling. I just cant seem to do it, otherwise I wouldve had done it already. I know ways to trigger dopamine and feel better. I just cant seem to make the first step. Im stuck in a loop of sleeping and watching Netflix. Im so tired, does anyone have advice to make the first step out of this? I dont want to live like this",
    "I have been severely depressed and it is affecting my school work and looking for advice Since Ive hit my 20s, my depression has just plummeted. In high school, I hadnt been diagnosed yet with my anxiety and depression, and even though it was present it didnt feel nearly as bad as this. I hit my 20s, now 23 yrs old, and I am having constant depression cycles. The cycles are becoming more frequent and each time it feels harder to come out of. As of lately I have been probably the most down that I have felt to date. I am in my sophomore year of college as a bio major. I havent been keeping up with classes, I have been failing exams and I dont have nearly enough credits to keep my scholarship for my junior year. I have fucked myself so badly with school I dont know what to do. I want so badly to take a leave of absence to get myself together, up my medication and see a therapist. I really want to get better. However, if I take a leave from school I will lose all financial aid for my junior year as well. My fiancé and I are pretty financially responsible people and have budgeted out for the next year and a half based on the financial aid we both receive. It is not an option to lose that money or we will be completely fucked. I am asking advice on what to do. I need to take a break from school or I will just keep digging myself deeper into this GPA and depression nightmare, but we also cant lose any money from it. I do want to reenroll for the fall semester, but I just need a break now. I am lost. Any advice would be so helpful.",
    "how would've you reacted \"You can start by apologizing for being depressed\" Hey guys, this is a quote that a super dear friend of mine said when she was upset and angry at the world. I couldnt handle this quote, and I had to shut the conversation after a fuck you for that. the context is that I was naming a couple of coaping skills cause god knows thats something Ive learned a lot of in the last couple of years and heshe said stop, I proceed ed to say, in just trying to help, sorry, which I didnt intend at all to sound like I was mocking him or her, this was followed with this message sorry if u dont understand but Im still agitated and heshe wont talk to me. I just wanted to know how any of you guys that has depression and anxiety wouldve reacted and how do you interoperate this quote. pls help",
    "Help me process my thoughts Today, my mother said, if I really wanted to do it Id do it. So does that mean every time she asked and forbade me to do something I just gave up easy? So its all my fault that Im like this. Im not trying to get better mentally hence I must not be wanting to. I stopped going to the therapist after my mother asked me to, because I didnt want to? I have thoughts of ending it all and be done with it every now and then, but I havent done it, so I dont want to? I dont know, maybe I am just pretending. Maybe Im just weak and pretending to have mental health issues as an excuse? Can anyone help me figure it out? How do I stop pretending!",
    "Why can't depression ever be gone forever? I got mad. And i couldnt get angry at anyone. I felt like even when i did my best to avoid something it happened again. And i burst crying pretty dramatically.. i felt devastated. I mean i know its a ridiculous way to react but i went from good day to worst day ever for a stupud reason in no time and i couldnt stop laughing for a while. I guess i felt frustrated or idk but i kept muttering stuff and couldnt stop crying. And when i calmed down about half an hour later i was worried i had reacted this way before when i wasnt feeling well but i didnt think id react that way now. I thought everything was fine. Now i just dont know if i really am. The only reason i can think of as the source is that Ill be taking classes again after almost a year now Ive failed my last high school year twice in the past when my depression was really bad and after that and therapy i felt good enough to study again i stopped highschool i chose a different institute i studied for two years and my grades were good for the two years ive been studyingi passed the final exam but half way through the end year project i just gave up. I dont know if i can blame my mental health for it or if i just turned into a self sabotaging person or just that it wasnt what i really wanted to do bur i was driven by the fact that i dont have a choice so i just did it. After that i stayed out of school for about a year doing half time jobs and now i want to try something different again. Im afraid thats the cause but i dont want it to be i just wanna finish what i start this time. This thing is already going on for too long. Im not sure what Im asking you here. But i guess i want an opinion or advice. Im worried i cant tell when Im not ok until symptoms get physical and how am i supposed to deal with that.. what if it affects how i deal with stuff negatively and Ill only be aware of it when its too late. Anyway.. thanks for reading until the end i appreciate it.",
    "Where to get help when you don’t have money for therapy/medication Hi there, Ive struggled to maintain my life living it since I was 8 22 now and am running out of ways to cope. Without going into detail my pain has doubled, during a time where almost everything in my life is going just fine. I dont want to commit suicide, I would have already if it was an option, but I dont know how to help myself tolerate this life.

    "I have no motivation This is hard. I am not doing very well. My life has been falling apart for a while now, I dont know how Im even functioning right now. I dont even have the energy to switch to my anonymous account for this anymore. It started after I lost my job. Then I lost my wife. Im working a menial overnight job now, and I just cant bring myself to start today. I feel like I lost myself. I feel like Im unworthy of love or compassion or kindness. I feel miserable every second. I tell myself that I am okay, because u know Im not and if I keep telling myself Im okay then maybe I will believe it. I miss my wife. I miss her for all the obvious reasons you miss a spouse. I try and put myself out there because I think Im ready, but Im not over her and I dont know when I will be over her. She was my first. I miss her. I went to therapy for a little while. She gave me some advice that didnt work and I stopped going. It never helped anyway, I would leave feeling 100 times worse. We have a kid, she is 3. The nature of the new job allows me to watch her while my wife goes to work. I try and sleep a little and I wake up to make sure she is ok then I go back to sleep. I couldnt sleep today. I couldnt do much of anything. I did all the things Im supposed to do as her father, but that was it. Normally I play and interact with her, but I just laid there without sleeping staring at nothing. I feel like such a failure. Everything is falling apart and I have no one to talk to and nothing I can do. I tried winning her back several times. I bore my soul. She doesnt want me or doesnt love me or both, and it tears me up inside. All I ever did was love her. I was just going through a real bad fit of depression, for longer than I think I was. I just feel so lost.",
    "Nothing helps. No matter what I do. Ill start my semesters of college with straight As, keep them till 23rds of the way through, then lose focus and end up with Cs or D and have to retake some classes. Im trying to stick with my career goal of becoming a teacher but at this rate Im still like 4 years away and Im already 21, making minimum wage. Im an absolute loser who nobody could love because I have no confidence. Confidence pisses me off, I just try to do whats required of me to get to where I need to be and that alone crushes me. Who could love somebody that has to fight to get themselves out of bed every morning? If I try to love myself, I just realize Im lying about my accomplishments and Ill take it too easy on myself and not get anything done. I should be squashed like an insect for being so useless. I just want somebody to blow my brains out and rid the world of my incompetence and then nobody would have to worry about me. Everyone worries about how many mistakes I make, how much I fuck up, how I cant keep my shit together consistently and just keep running in circles. Id rather just admit defeat and die. And so many people in the world probably think those like me should. Im beyond saving it feels like and my brain is too fried to cling to any one thing. I just want everything to be true so I can stop worrying about being wrong all the time. I dont even make sense anymore.",

    "I need help saving a friend So yesterday, my best friend told me straight up that she plans on taking her life some time in the future, and obviously I tried to do everything in my power to convince her not to, but its not working. She says that she doesnt want to be alive anymore and that she doesnt want to know what her future holds, and shes tired of it all. Basically she doesnt have the will to live anymore because she doesnt feel like anything in her life is paying off or is worth living for anymore.

Here is my situation, I posted about this on tifu and other subreddits. Throwaway account. This did not actually happen today, this has been a huge progressive fuck up thats been building up steam for months now. Please Reddit I need your help, and advice. Please! Ive been married for 25 years, currently have 4 kids, and let me tell you when youve been married for this long, lots of things can get into your head, shit rattles around there, echoes, ferments in a way that others sometimes just cant comprehend. At times I feel blessed to have been married for so long, but at times living in here Tallahassee, in bum fuck Florida, in a shitty rental just gets to yea, you know? Sometimes the stresses of parenthood can be at times almost suffocating, I hope at least some of you out here, anyone really can just understand where Im coming from.

    "My boyfriend had recently self harmed, and this has triggered me The entire time my 24yo boyfriend and I 21F have been together, he has always suffered with depression and anxiety. He has his good periods and bad periods, and I learnt how to deal with both. Hes off anti depressants, and hasnt been to therapy in a while. Until a few days ago, hes only ever told me about his urges, but has never actually self harmed. Then one morning, he told me he had cut himself, and how he was sorry and was really ashamed he had done it. I was supportive towards him, let him cry, and made sure he was okay. But after I had dealt with this, the thoughts of self harm seem to have become more frequent in my head. I have dealt with recurrent self harm thoughts in the past, but I havent suffered with them recently. I hope that I never act on these, but if I did I fear that he would blame himself, or think that I acted out to be like him. Im just confused.",

    "Should I kill myself? I am the most uninteresting person and I feel like I am the only one who puts effort into any of my relationships. But when we broke up, they were there for me. Though I hated myself for opening up to them, showing the weak side of myself, showing my insecurity, and once again depending on others for emotional stability is so unhealthy and unattractive. I cried infront of them, I told them about how I suffered with suicidal thoughts, I told them about my past and what I went through and they listened to me. I am grateful for that but I never should of told them a thing. 2020 happened and I began isolating myself, I attempted suicide once at the start. I tried reaching out to Angela, I didnt want to tell any of them about my issues any more but I wanted to distract myself and have someone to chat to. No response, the lack of effort I put in my friends finally came to haunt me. Once I got over my ex in march 2020, no one wanted to talk to me anymore. We werent able to see eachother at school and I didnt build that relationship where we can just text. We werent able to hangout so the friendships sort of rotted. I thought I was hopeless, friendless, and losing more prospects for the future. I dont have connections to be successful. I have nothing. So I though why not end it. I took a bunch of pills but I just ended up blacking out and puking a bunch. I remember the feeling of blacking out but I could still hear the voice of people freaking out as I was fading. I lost vision and feeling but I could still hear. I thought I was dead. But no I wasnt, I started therapy regularly. I was so hopeless and didnt know how to make friends but I kept pushing through. I tried reaching out a few times and sometimes they said hi back. I ended up hanging out with Angela once restrictions lifted a bit in the summer. But after that we struggled to talk again. My other 2 friends ended up dating and stopped talking to most people becsuse of that.",
    "Am I Disabled Enough? one house. We live in a room with my two daughters. Due to Covid and being a lifeguard during this time, my partner lost his job at the pool. So there is no employment.

Weve also been rental searching but theres just nothing in our price range and those that ARE dont want an unemployed family. I have nightmares, PTSD flashes for me thats flashes of rage that make me barely restrain the urge to hurt myself or very occasionally other people.

    "Burned out and trying to come back from it First time posting here. Looking for incite on things. Backstory Im in a weird place in my life right now. I just turned 30, and there have been events in my life that I want to get over. I could itemize the events but its more about my feelings about them that I want to move on from. I was a social work student but I dropped out because it was emotionally draining. And across a lot of different areas of my life I need to cope with things. I feel defeated and ashamed of myself. I feel like I dream too big and cant attain those dreams. I feel pain from society and how people treat me and each other. Im sick and tired of the hate we all do to each other. We are all in pain for different reasons in life. I feel like its pain for seeing how the world is and wishing that these conversations would start to get visibly better. I scroll Reddit because of how amazingfunnybeautiful things can be. I think Im too weighed down from seeing so much pain. I got divorced a year ago and all of my friends and I lost touch. My ex was a good person most of the time but he did some pretty abusive stuff too. And so Im dealing with grief of people no longer being in my life that I liked having around but that I had to say goodbye to in a way so that my life could try to get better. I want the grief to heal. I want my self worth to heal back. Im tired emotionally and I know Ill get back on my feet. Theres so many reasons to feel sad about anything or everything. But what do you do next once you know that? Knowing theres endless reasons for things to be bad or to be good. I feel drained like its some sort of mental gravity not sure how to describe it but almost like Ive been working myself too hard. Things will get better but I need to figure out how to heal myself inside.",
    "I think my boyfriend left me due to his depression and I need some help to understand and deal with this situation. Were officially broken up... but were not just friends. I explained my thoughts on this matter to him and he told me that he didnt think it through and maybe was overhasty to break up and admitted his actual reason for breaking up were his thoughts going in circles, so he just ended things to stop this  although it seems that this didnt improve anything for him. He said he doesnt know what his feelings for me are but he doesnt want to lose me and a lot of other things none of which sounded like things you tell a friend. I dont know what to do. I want to give him time but as far as I know, hes doing nothing to improve his situation and I cant take this much longer. I know that most people  especially in the relationship subreddits...  probably would just tell me to put an end to this and forget him. To confirm that Im not totally delusional for thinking that we might get back together, Ive talked to some friends... and surprisingly, no one told me to just give up and that theyre confused, too, and also think that his behavior isnt that of just a friend. And now, Im still here because Ive seen that he really cares about me and feels more for me than for a friend. I have the feeling that the actual reason for the breakup and whats standing between us arent not enough feelings or arguments or any other stuff... but his depression. Many people tend to cut people out of their lives too easily and I dont just want to leave this awesome person behind because hes going through a hard time. tldr Boyfriend has depression and broke up with me but still treats me more like his girlfriend than just a friend. His reasons didnt sound like they have much to do with me but more with his depression.

But last night, I felt that sense of extreme hopelessness about my life in general. I felt completely numb, empty, and at the edge of doing it. But then I thought about the people Ill leave behind, esp my mom. i realized I need help. Seeking a therapist is probably the better option than venting out in this group. but being unemployed 32yo, and without savings, I guess sharing my situation is a more practical way of trying to get away from that urge to end things.

How do you trust people and give life another chance?",
    "At 43 (M), depression is new to me and I don't know how to handle it. Im a married man, to a wonderful woman. We love each other tons and consider each other our best friend. We recently made a huge move across the country and for the first couple of years, my wife was so unhappy. Despite having a couple of college friends in the area, as well as some of her family, she missed her parents, her job sucked, she just was miserable. And this made me miserable, because the move was mostly my idea as jobs for me are more plentiful where we are. But weve always had evenings and weekends and love our time together. We go on day trips, check out restaurants, everything together. Then we both got new jobs and the world changed. Suddenly, I was working from home and have been since early March, 2020, while she continues to go into work in healthcare. Her new job is mentally stressful, but really great for her. Shes making friends with the women she works with, which would make me SO HAPPY... except now Im the odd man out. My day is make us breakfast, make her lunch, take her to work, come home and work from home, go pick her up from work, make dinner, do the dishes, etc. Of COURSE she helps around the house. Laundry, cat boxes, taking out trash, etc. Im not mentioning my chores to show an imbalance, just a monotony. A few weeks ago her work friends planned a gettogether after work. She mentioned that I should come by when they were almost done with dinner so I could grab a few drinks with everyone. I parked the car and texted her that I was nearby. She said, uh oh. I dont think they wanted husbandsboyfriends here. So I drove all the way back home and realized something. Im lonely and depressed. I knew I was down about working from home. Im a very outgoing person and need human interaction and its been soulcrushing. But once my wife had something with friends that didnt involve me, I realized that I have nothing but her.",
    "My mom found out I've been skipping classes. What do I do? So Ive been diagnosed with depression, and am currently on meds. Though, they dont work 100 of the time. I have been skipping classes due to lack of motivation, anxiety, and fear. I dont think my mother believes I have depression, and still thinks it is the cause of my medication As the person who has the illness, I can tell its not just the medicine. She gets angry at me for skipping classes, Rightfully so, but it still hurts because Im not doing this for attention or laziness and wants to talk to my guidance counselor and teachers. I know they are going to put it on me, because I am the one whos been skipping and not asking for help. Im trying to attend as much as I can and get assignments done, but its never enough. Its true this is my fault, but I feel like they dont understand that Im not doing this out of laziness Im doing it because I want to off myself and cant take this anymore. Ive been having suicidal thoughts more recently, but I dont think I will be believed. I dont know what I should do anymore. Im trying to bring up my grades and attend classes but my mind and body are so sick and exhausted. What do I do? Taking the death route feels easier than facing this. Theres so many things I want to do, but I dont think Ill be able to at the rate Im going.",

    "How do you get past feelings of guilt? Hi everyone, Ive been recently wondering what to do to get past feelings of guilt over past mistakes and wrongdoings. I know that I hurt some close friends quite badly when I was severely depressed. Im not using it as an excuse for my behaviour, as I still said the terrible things and was unkind to them. Now, Ive looked at those mistakes, spoken to people and have been working to make myself a better person and hopefully a better friend to other people in the future. Given all of this, how can I get over the feelings of guilt over what was said? I know its not healthy to hold onto such feelings but at the same time, Im not sure how to stop thinking about those actions and feeling bad. Ive read somewhere that as we grow, learn and improve from our mistakes and to forgive ourselves, but I am not sure what techniques to try in order to do this. Thank you for reading",

    "Almost 25 and I want to give up, what to do?? long story short, I feel like I wasnt raised with a chance to successful in life. I grew up being very neglected, experienced all forms of abuse, and ended up leaving home at 16. I have struggled to finish school and have never managed to complete anything after highschool. I still struggle with PTSD and mental health issues. Ive managed to get sober almost 1 year and half sober however lost almost all my friends cause I dont want to go out to bars or clubs anymore, so it kinda alienates me from my peers. Ive been trying to make new friends but its kind of hard especially with covid. Im a bit over halfway through a degree. I am uncertain if I even want to do it though.. I want to give up. I feel jealous of a lot of people my age who are doing so much better than me in life but I also notice a lot of these people have supportive family emotionally and financially so I think it is unreasonable I compare myself to people who have not faced the same challenges. I know I need to accept that this is where I am in life, but it so hard to stop hating myself so deeply. I feel so ashamed for achieving nothing in life and just being a broken mess at 25. I want to end it all but I know part of me also has some hope that it could be better. But I just cant handle the shame.",
    "(18F) I mentally cannot balance Full-time university and work Im an 18F who is enrolled in university fulltime and works around 2023 hours a week. I live at home, but I pay bills and not working isnt an option. I have been depressed for two years and when I first quit my job to focus on school my parents got angry and hounded me everyday to get another job. I feel like I am less of a person because I cant juggle fulltime school and work, my coworkers brag about how much they work on top of school and it makes me feel like Im inadequate because I cant handle my 20 hours. I work as a pharmacy assistant and it is an extremely demanding job. I have hobbies and a boyfriend, so it feels like my schedule is always full. I dont mind a busy schedule, but its hard right now because of the depression. I just started Sertraline Zoloft two weeks ago, so on top of my depression symptoms I think Im experiencing drowsiness from the medication. Any help would be appreciated, I feel very deflated right now.",

Recently he started college, and he hasnt really seemed to have time for me. Questions and anxieties pile up in his pms and he only occasionally responds. I cant lose him.",
    "I’m 15 and don’t want to live with my dad anymore. My parents have been divorced for 7 years and I go to my moms house weekdays, my dads weekends. The main issue I have with my dad is that I simply cant trust him. I cant open up to him without him rejecting my opinion. Growing up with him has made me feel helpless, and living with him feels like giving him all the control. He has threatened to take my phone because I said I value emotional relationships more than comfortable living. He threatened to go to court and call the police if I refused to go to his house. I said I wouldnt mind going for dinner and such, but he outright rejects my opinions. He said it wasnt my choice, and that just proves my point where I cant trust him to respect my feelings. He knows I have depression. He says hes willing to change, but I dont have the mental capacity to live with him if he doesnt change by himself. I live in BC Canada, so the age requirement for choosing who to live with is 19, but I researched about it and it said that the court will mostly decide for the childs best interest. Im terrified of the slightest possibility that my dad will win custody. At that point, I might as well kill myself. My dad is a negative influence, a toxic personality. I cut out most toxicity from my life because its caused me to be depressed, and its why I dont want to see him again. Im trying to compromise but I cant live with him. I just feel upset and terrified right now.",
    "Hey. Hi. I wanted to reach out. To have a genuine interaction with another person. No pretenses or ulterior motives. Im on the balcony of a hotel in Thailand and looking out at that long drop, it just makes me wonder what if. I dont know if Ive ever felt as lost as I do tonight. In my cynicism I fear that people dont actually genuinely carefor others, me included, and why would they eh? Does that kind of warmth and love exist in the world outside of fairytales and movies? I have these doubts so I really dont reach out usually, even to the people I surround myself with. But right now maybe Im chasing rainbows again, but Id like some genuine communication, even if its on the internet and under the mask of anonymity. If anyone would care. If you would take the time to hear me. Im 22. I live in South Korea and Ive been quite sad, depressed, since the 9th grade. Its been 8 years. I feel like Ive lost a lot of what made me me in that time. I feel like an empty shell. All the color and life sucked out and nothing but an empty husk left. Yet despite all that Ive lost, I believe I have much more to lose still, because I have despaired before, believing Ive hit rock bottom. Then time would pass and Id look back, only to realize how much I had back then. When I first started to have depressing thoughts, self doubt, existential problems, I turned to my family for help. My mother, father and sister. Why? because theyre my family, and I thought it would matter to them that I, their son, was suffering so genuinely, in so much pain and doubt. When I was so lost and confused and desperately reaching out to them, they fucking turned their back on me. Or so I felt, back then and I still do. I felt so betrayed that the people I loved and trusted the most in the world would do that so I became bitter and made a promise to myself that Id never share my life with them again.",
    "26. Depressed, socially anxious, lost and suicidal. One of the only positive things that has happened recently is I began talking to a girl i met on a dating site. We talk for at least 3 hours over the phone everyday. This is the most social activity ive had in a long time even though she does 70 percent of the talking. She likes talking about herself. Hearing her talk about her life only makes me more depressed because she has done so much and made the most out of her life. I honestly have no clue what she sees in me. I shared these feelings with her and to my surprise she is still talking to me, although she doesnt really understand how it feels to have depression and pretty much told me my life is not that bad. So here I am, a 26 year old socially inept man child who has no idea what he wants to do with his life. This dry eye problem is also stressing me out and i really want to get it taken care of so i can move on and do something productive with my life. I really think the military would be a good thing for,mw but I dont want to enlist until my eyes feel better but i also feel like time is running out because i cant join once I get past a certain age. I dwell on the past everyday and i wish I could go back in time. When I think about the past I get depressed and when I think about the future i get anxious. I get so anxious even thinking about being around New people because they will judge me and think i am too quiet. I also am afraid if someone asks about my past and my highschoolcollege life what do I tell them? I dont want to tell people I was a pothead who did nothing in Highschool. I also feel like im playing catch up in learning social skills when everyone else my age just has those skills naturally. I dont know what to do from here.",
    "Drowning in regret I dont know what to do, there are a lot of things in my life that I deeply regret. I cant make peace with myself. Im constantly berating myself over my past actions and I feel like such a terrible person. Its nobodys fault but my own and I cant go back or start over and I cant handle that. Im crying multiple times a day and my mental state is seriously affecting my studies at uni. I feel like Im never going to be happy again nor do I deserve it. How do I cope?",
    "I cannot see a bright side or way out of my situation right now Im a sophomore coming to the end of my second year at this school and I have made zero friends, done zero things with anyone since welcome week freshman year and have only spent two quarters on campus. And by the time I graduate I will not have spent a full year at SCU. COVID cut off freshman year, obliterated this year, I will get to do study abroad next year which im very grateful for yes but it does have its downsides, and then senior year Ill graduate in the spring. There will be zero time for me to make any friends at SCU. I only have one quarter next year to do it in person before being gone until the next fall. How the hell am I supposed to make any sort of meaningful friendships or experiences in one quarter if Im a stupid introvert. Im gonna end up looking back on college the same way I do high school, four years of skirting the edge of fun and seeing everyone else have what I cant. I hate it, its crushing me. Theres zero hope for me, I will not have a fun college experience. Others will make friends theyll be friends with for years, Id be lucky to make one for a day. I hate it I hate it I hate myself. Last year in the spring I talked to someone about feeling like this, and they said dont worry, I made most of my friends my second year. You have plenty of time and that gave me hope for a bit but thats gone now. I didnt make any friends last year, none this year, Ive got one quarter to next year. And by senior year everyone will be in their groups, on their way out, reminiscing about fun times I can only daydream of. And now is find myself reading rSuicidewatch incessantly. Im not gonna kill myself but I cant stop bringing it up in my head. Sorry to rant like this but I was going crazy keeping this inside my head",
    "The current situation has caused a HUGE setback Thank the good Lord for food stamps and Food Share, Ill never go hungry. So since Im disabled, waiting for benefits, my rent is 50month. I also had internet shut off because I couldnt pay them just 50 too. My needs are small Ive had help from friends and family, and then eventually from several local church charities. And, well, Ive run out of options and was scrolling through Reddit. I saw a couple of subs in which to ask for help. So I took a deep breath and posted how I need help paying my bills. The only reason I did this is that I have seen many messages of gratitude from individuals who received help. But that didnt happen for me. In fact there were some negative responses, and both posts where completely down voted. So, I guess either I dont know how to ask for help, or people just dont care. Lets add to my situation that my one good friend is going through some of their own challenges, and being a complete jerk. Ive heard that the economic stimulus package wont pay anyone who is not working. Figures, the people who need it the most get nothing. And I pray it is only a rumour, because 1000 could set me up for many months while I work on my disability claim. The California Governor has issued a shelter in place order. I have asthma pretty badly, so Im party of the group that SERIOUSLY shouldnt go out. Same with my motherinlaw. My anxiety and depression had returned in full force. I have thought, again of giving up on my life. There is really NOTHING good about it. At all. My sister has shunned me because she knows nothing about mental health, and thinks I should just be happy. Ive never really had any meaningful relationship with my mom. She has been emotionally unavailable my entire life. So what am I left with? A complete shut down. No news, or Internet. Im typing on my government phone which has very limited data. But at least I can post My friend is unavailable. Yesterday I went to my motherinlaws place so I could download some movies.",
    "Had my 1st doctor appointment to address my anxiety/depression, it was......weird. Need some feedback, please. Are antidepressants and medications like this still a total crapshoot? Cant doctors to prior testing to figure out how a particular medication will affect an individual? It just feels odd...coming from a world Id previous known getting diagnosed and treated for migranes where everything was testing testing testing! MRI and Cat Scans and Blood tests and this and that!!! before being able to figure out something that works for migraines. But now with my mental health its just idk, well throw this against the wall and see if it sticks. Makes me incredibly uncomfortable. ampx200B 3. When taking my first steps to address my issues a few weeks ago and making this appointment with a psychiatrist, I had absolutely no idea what kind of doctor Im supposed to see, what is recommended, or who even diagnoses you with depression or anxiety. I dont want to selfdiagnose, it just doesnt feel right. After this appointment I still didnt feel like I was formally diagnosed, just given medication. So I chose this Psychiatrists office because they had decent reviews of any I could find. I made an appointment before I understood that the Psychiatrist is the one that mainly focuses on drugs and medication, NOT therapy. Does formal diagnosis happen? What kind of doctor does that? Or is that a totally false preconceived notion I have. What kind of doctor is it most common to see first? A psychologist, CBT, psychiatrist, therapist? I just dont know all the terminology. ampx200B The path Ive currently chosen Ive not taken my medication not started, cancelled appointments with this psychiatrist, and gotten an appointment for CBT with a therapist first, which feels like a safer path for me. As much as I want to address my issues NOW Im impatient, going straight to medication just didnt feel right... ampx200B I could go on a rant about just how difficult it has been for someone with no prior experience trying to deal with this new situation in American Healthcare, but I wont.",

When covid rolled around, fuck me. My partner for the last 4 years were long distance as shes abroad for school witnessed me slipping down and down the slope throughout the year. With patience and understanding, she was always there. Now, shes getting tired of it and she admitted it. Not sure if she still loves me the same, but one thing is for sure, shes tired of putting up with the episodes. im not so sure if i can put up with this the rest of my life. but she still remains, still providing what support she can spare.

    "A friend of mine is dealing with some major depression and she isn’t texting me back. I need some advice. I have read some articles on this and I know that she likely just does not have the energy or motivation to respond, but the thing is, I would really like to talk to her since her depression does not seem to be getting better despite therapy and medication. I really feel like I should do something to help but I cant seem too since she wont engage in conversation with me. Im not at all blaming her, I understand how she feels, I just wish I could somehow get through to her so that I can do my part as a friend to help and encourage her.

    "My life is meaningless, and I’m struggling really hard with pain and emptiness. Anyone feel the same way...? Every day is just bleh. I have no purpose, no reason to live, so every day ends up feeling empty. I dissociate heavily all the time, so it feels like my life isnt even mine anymore, in the passenger seat of my own body, as if my strange hands and floating disembodied voice dont belong to me. I dont recognize the stranger in the mirror. I want to cry with every ounce of my being, but I just cant, no matter how hard I try. There is no release. Basic personal hygiene requires so much mental energy that it just ends up getting neglected entirely. How can I think about brushing my teeth when I dont even want to get out of bed? Hell, when I dont even want to wake up? Its all way too much to put into words, and this post is already pretty long. Sorry for rambling. Thanks for making it to the end of this novella.",

I had a lot of shit happen a month ago and Im struggling to deal with it now. I went numb until recently because it was just too much. I almost killed myself on a Monday. Wednesday I found out my friend did kill himself. Sunday was the funeral. Monday I was raped by someone I thought was my friend. Tuesday my boyfriend kept making suicide jokes. Wednesday I broke up with him. I cried over my friends passing. It hurts, I still get sad sometimes, but its out of my system for the most part. What isnt out of my system is the rape. I didnt realize it had happened until about a week ago. Like I knew factually we had sex and I felt like I cheated but I couldnt really remember it. Then a week ago I told a friend what happened and hes actually the one that pointed out uhhh thats rape. And I was like oh...yeah.... I guess so.

    "Anti-Depressants effect on sex? Hey Ive only just recently lost my virginity and Ive been on anti depressanta for a few months. I heard they could make it harder to cum and that has been the case even with masturbation. It took longer to finish after I started the treatment. Well when I lost my virginity this week I just dint finish, as Ive had two sessions of 40min and cant finish. It dosent go soft or anything, I care about my partner and she is trying to fulfill my needs in bed so its not that. Also the sensation is dulled, Ive heard sex is supposed to feel amaizing but I felt little to nothing in the way of pleasure at first. The second time I had been off anti depressants for a day and did feel some more pleasure but It was dulled. When I mean pleasure I think its more accurate to say stimulation. Im 20, M if that helps my partner is Female its that helps too. Any advice on what to do? Ive been doing a lot better but I dont want to stop usimg my anti depressants just to feel something when im with my partner. Has anyone gone through this?",

I still dont have a job, have never tried to applyget an interview, and now I feel like I dont even have time for one.

I hate the gravel roadspotholes of this town, hate driving on ice for 10 months of the year, I just dont ever want to deal with the stress again. Ive lived with my parents ever since the pandemic, and of course not being able to drive makes me feel like I dont have any agency or independence. Cant go to school or a job because I feel like a huge burden and failure whenever I ask them to take me anywhere. I dont have any friends and dont really feel worthy enough to have any, but Ive accepted that for a while. I feel so ugly and worthless and I think any reasonable person would probably agree. I have nothing to offer. I guess Im going to email a therapist again soon, even though I have no health insurance and certainly dont have the money to just spend. I was trying to save my student loan money but I dont even know what the point is anymore. Thanks for reading.

    "Can someone maybe help give me a little encouragement to get out of bed? I need to shower, its been 4 days. My hair is greasy and I probably smell. Im seeing a tattoo artist in the afternoon and I should be happy but I cant get out of this bed. I know I need to, I know I should, but it just feels like a weight on my chest. I just cant bring myself to get up and put effort into looking presentable. I have to shower then I have to dry my hair and get dressed and put on makeup and eat something and go outside. It just seems like too much. I feel guilty because I blame myself for being lazy. My depressions been worse recently because I lost what I would call my ESA last week. I had him for almost 11 years and he kept me alive. I adopted a new cat but its not the same. He hasnt been around long enough to have the same connection. It does help ease the grief a little though. I was told I was too dramatic for heavily grieving for my cat so Ive been holding it all in. I dont want to bother anyone. Honestly I could just use some encouragement. Some motivation maybe. Thank you for just reading this even if you dont respond.",
    "The Story of This Year The girl came home and rushed me to hospital while the other one stayed at the party to get drunk. The girl was very supportive and stayed with me the entire time at the hospital, my other room mate, Max, didnt visit me at all. I considered Max a brother too me, I loved him dearly and I tried to do whatever I could for him to show how much I appreciate him. When he didnt visit me it really got to me and upset me. We spoke and he was angry and upset with me for doing what I did, so I left the house for over a week and stayed at the flat where I used to stay. I waited for him to calm down and I went home, I didnt want him to be angry and upset with me so I thought I would give him the space. I started seeing counsellors and psychiatrists. My counsellor helped me quite a bit, she was the first counsellor Ive actually enjoyed talking too and looked forward to seeing. We worked through my problems and she came to the conclusion that leaving the house would be for the best and she supported my decision of going back to college, so I did. After I told my room mates I was doing this they hated me. They didnt want to speak to me or see me. They said some pretty nasty things to me, and I back to them. I lost my two best friends, and my brother. Its been just over 2 months since Ive moved out and Im still miserable about it all. I think about them everyday and I see all their Snapchats together and it ruins me because we used to do everything together. Because I left my lease Im in debt up to my eyebrows. I had to come up with a bond and 2 weeks rent for my college and I have to come up with money for the bills towards the house that I still havent paid, and unable to afford. Ive taken out 3 loans since leaving which has put me through further debt and I dont know what to do. The last 3 weeks have been the worst for me. I havent stopped crying, Ive been using drugs and alcohol to mask my responsibilities and now everything has creeped up on me.",
    "Got rejected from my desired program Hi, I was bullied and betrayed by probably all the people I thought I loved and was also living with my abusive dad when I was attending my last year of high school. This caused me to be severely depressed and suicidal during that year, but miraculously I still managed to get in to my dream school which happened to be UBC Canadian school. Anyways I was accepted into the Sauder School of Business in UBC and went there right after high school. However, that was the WORST decision of my life because I was still severely depressed and suicidal by the time university came around and scored the lowest marks of my life. Im talking about me being a 95 GPA student in high school going straight to a 55 GPA student in university, and also failed a science course my favorite subject btw. This happened because the whole first term, I stayed in bed so much resulting in missing class, barely showered, ate irregularly, and refused to hand in assignments just because I subconsciously wanted to selfsabotage myself or something. This really screwed my grades up, but thankfully I started seeing a psychologist and also got antidepressants and they helped me function normally after my first term in my first year. Ever since then, Ive tried my best to correct my mistakes and raise my GPA, been scoring mostly As and Bs I managed to get my GPA up to 75 but that first term just... drags me down still. I recently applied to change programs to science because I realized business is just NOT for me, and I want to do science... but I got rejected due to my failed course and my past 55 GPA for the first 5 courses I ever took in university. Im already one year behind because of my decision to change programs but now Ill be 2 years behind because of this rejection  I have to reapply for the next year . Im broke and poor and have to pay more debt the longer I stay in school  I dont even know if Ill be accepted next year when I reapply... Anyone have any advice for me? Im so lost... I feel like even when I function normally, depressed me from the past will always drag me down and bring me back to that state...",

    "Letting my boyfriend commit suicide. Please help. He thinks he may be in the autism spectrum. He thinks hes incompetent and useless. He thinks hes very ugly I think he has BDD because I have it myself. The biggest issue is probably his OCD. He has severe contamination OCD, and its what hes in disability for. He says OCD is hell. One big example  He lived in a flat with Artex ceilings most of his adult life moved now and he believes hes been exposed to a lot of asbestos. He wants to end his life before lung cancer sets in. He is scared of aging and his body and mind deteriorating, getting diseases or becoming disabled and reliant on others for care. He resents this is the way things are and wants to end his life before nature can take its course. He resents life. I sympathize with all of these things and relate to many. The NHS has failed him. There seems to be no good help within his options. Hes so pessimistic about healthcare workers now that he doesnt want to try. He plans on committing suicide before summer because he thinks this flat is going to get unbearably hot. Its on the 3rdtop floor. His OCD wont allow him to use a fan because hes scared of fibers flying around, and no coolers involving water because hes worried about mold. He doesnt think a portable ac unit will be able to cool the flat down enough and that it will be very expensive. I cant personally think of another solution for the heat. I want him to know happiness, but it doesnt seem possible. I feel awful that hes stuck around for my sake. Hes missed out on sourcing the best drug for suicide now that UK customs are more strict since early January. He doesnt blame me, but it is my fault, and I really wont ever be able to forgive myself for it. Really, I do think he resents me. I dont know how to cope or how to go on myself. I need help, and I dont have anywhere to get it. Nothing makes any of this okay or better.",
    "I’ve been so depressed that I’ve had suicidal ideation for several days and feel like no one cares. I have been depressed for several weeks now to tje point where I have thoughts to end my life several times a day. I push them away, usually, but I really feel alone in what is going on. While my best friend knows, I dont want to burden her any more bc she has a lot going on. And when I told a few other close friends about the turmoil I was feeling, they said they needed time to process it and never addressed the issue again. I feel like this is a sign they dont care.",
    "Loving one is Depressed :/ Hey guys, so i was daiting with a girl and after trying and trying she couldnt get any feelings for me. We got into a big conversation about it after 2 months. She never told anybody and never ever talked about it with somebody. She told me that she is Depressed. I asked for some reasons and when it started. She told me that it started in high school because her parents have really high hopes in her and pressuring her pretty much. She is 19 now. I feel like she told me as well the reason why she cant love me is because of her depression. I told her that im ready to help her anytime and all. But she doesnt want help and really doesnt like it when others help her. She doesnt cry infront of anyone because thats a symbole of weakness she tells me. I really care about her. It even feels like it hurts me more then her to a point. I dont know what to do. And i feel like if i will be there for her that one day she might feel how it is to love somebody. Since she told me that she never loved someone really. So if anyone could give me a tip on how to handle the situation that would be the greatest thing ever. I also asked her this question on a scale to 010 if 0 is that she loves her life and most things are going well and 10 is i want to kill myself as soon as possible. She answered 8. Im really concerned. And getting a therapist isnt an option as well for her. She would never take any pills either or so. She isnt Religious, she feels the best if she is just alone and if she has her quietness. She feels pressured if she is outside with her friends etc.. She also doesnt find relationships appealing. Maybe because she never had a goodreal one with feelings but that is just an assumption. She has guilty feelings because she started daiting me and wishes me to find a better one. She doesnt really like herself etc etc. Dont understand me wrong. Outside she is a extrovert, like nobody would know that she is actually depressed im sure.",

    "Does anyone else feel like they deserve to feel depression and feel shitty all the time? Im just curious if this is a normal feeling. I might have options to get out of my depression, like certain pills, maybe PMS pills antidepressants seem to never work but my depression gets 10 times worse around my period and maybe counseling would work. Maybe these things would work if I tried them again even if they havent in the past, but for two reasons I haventbesides cost. First I dont think theyd work or the side effects to meds wouldnt be worth it. But second and perhaps more important idk that I want to get better, I feel like I should live with all the shitty feelings and guilt, like I have to or deserve to. I dont do it for attention, maybe once in my life when I was much more lost, when all this depression started to get bad, but not anymore, I barely even talk about my depression to anyone anymore. Is this normal? Or common? To feel like you deserve misery? Or am I actually just being an attention whore throwing a pity party for herself or something stupid like that? I dont want to be that.",

Part of me wants to just give up, cause the thing I am studying isnt even that useful, its more to help myself. Is there any way I can improve my brain?",
    "How do I become a person? Ok That might be a weird question but I needed to ask. Ive had depression all my life. During early childhood, teenage years, and now as an adult. Happiness is exhausting. Nothing is relaxing. Everything is just boring. Im either angry or Im numb. I dont even take showers to feel clean anymore. I just take them so I can waste time and feel like I can go to bed sooner. Heres my problem. I dont remember if I developed a personality before my depression took over. I dont know if I was a real person as a child, or if I was just a puppet or something. I feel like Im floating in life and I dont know how to develop a personality. Does anyone have any ideas at all where I can start? Things that used to calm me down just make me angry and frustrated. Thank you",

Every so often, almost daily, I get really sad at night, I start thinking about all I lost and about all I cant have right now, regarding friends, I lose motivation for anything, dont wanna get up but also dont wanna stay in bed doing nothing, I just cant do anything and I have to force myself to go to uni and sketch a smile on my face so I dont worry the friends I made there. Its getting to the point where Id say its unliveble to have this feeling everyday, but I feel like I cant do anything about it, doesnt feel like my choice to be sad or happy anymore. If theres anything you guys would suggest to try and brighten up my mood Id love some help. Thanks in advance.",

    "Drowning in my own tears I F22 am a reserved person and never really had a positive or functional family life. My dad died when I was 10 and my mom youngest of her family never really moved on from that and has always been dependent on other people. My childhood home was foreclosed and at age 18 I lived in a crusty trailer park with her for three years. Finally out now, but the deep emotional turmoil is still with me. Its been a long journey to accept and let go of grief and constant longing for a protective nurturing positive figure. My current boyfriend of 2 years and 4 months has been there for me more often than Id like to admit to get me out of that trailer park to finally start living on our own. And were finally doing that and for that Im very grateful. But its been obvious that I am still emotionally dependent and needy. Ive had over sixteen weeks of therapy and its helped a lot but this is the hardest obstacle Ive had to tackle with myself, trying to build resilience and harden myself like my partner has. We had a long talk tonight basically about what wed change about each other. He said he feels like my parent sometimes and that he can only rely on himself and maybe 2 other people, sometimes. But not me because Im not in a fully realized independent position yet. To be honest that struck me like an arrow. I already told him if he feels like he has to act like a parent, Id rather him not act at all. I dont want to be constantly coddled or comforted, and I told him its not fair to assume he can only rely on himself if he doesnt give me a chance to. We ended this conversation on a good note that we both have to make changes and now hes hanging out with our friendsroommates but for the past 3 hours Im still upset and crying in the room I told him I needed space. Why is letting go so hard for me. Why is it when I feel this shitty and keep thinking about my dad that I have to be the most alone. Its been over 12 years but I feel like I cant move on like my mom hasnt and one of my biggest fears is ending up like her.",
    "I want to go home I F, 19 am a sophomore in college. I have a wonderful family my three siblings and I are extremely close, and our parents love us and each other. I know Im very lucky for that. I grew up on a small farm in the desert, and we were dirt poor. Our house was a hundred years old and was built from adobe and railroad ties. The plywood floors had holes in them that snakes and mice would come through, and my sister and I shared a bed until I was twelve. I remember times when all we had to eat was what we had left over from the previous harvest and the animals we had raised. My summers were spent working our land and taking trips with my friends from church and school to the muddy river that only flowed with the snowmelt in the spring and the torrential monsoons in the summer. We always had dogs and barn cats and chickens. It was so simple and easy, and I loved that farm and my life with my whole heart. When I was 15, we moved to a city a few hours away and kept the farm. Wed go up on weekends to take care of little projects, and I would get to see the friends Id grown up with. I never felt like I had really moved away. Ive since started college in a town much closer to my farm, and I go to visit often. My dad stayed up there for work and stays in a trailer we brought up. He takes care of our chickens and farms in the warmer months. Our work weekends are more scattered now that all the kids are grown and moved away. Our house is uninhabitable now and the land is going wild again. Coming home just isnt the same anymore. Lately, all I want, and all I can think about, is to go home. Not just making the drive and seeing my dad and the farm. I fantasize about waking up in the morning in my bed, 10 again, snuggled with my sister against the cold and the wind howling outside. I want to be with my family the way we were when we all lived under the same roof and to work in the garden and take walks through the desert with my brother, looking for elk and coyote tracks in the river basin.",
    "I need help I am in high school and I have clinical depression. I have decided to seek help on this subreddit. The cause of my depression is not something a psychiatrist or a psychologist can fix. There is something I want in life and without it, I can not live. Without it, I feel like I have no purpose. It is not an object nor a person. It is something that would allow me to change this world and I mean in a huge, impactful way. I can not get it however because it is not decreed for me. I do not want to do something else as this is what I want to work for in my life. Anything less is not worth the struggle to fight for. Without it, I am just another regular person who walks the Earth and doesnt do anything for impact. Please understand it is not something I can simply be told to leave behind, otherwise, I wouldnt be seeking help. I do not want to kill myself. Life is too precious and I know if I can see things differently, maybe things can change.",
    "I need help to better myself I am a 19 year old student at his first in person semester on campus. I am overweight, always tired, sleep deprived, unmotivated, and losing friends everyday. It has never been this hard for me to get out of bed, notice something positive in my life, or have fun doing things I enjoy like saxophone or longboarding. I am stuck in an endless cycle of feeling unmotivated to do schoolwork, which makes me feel sad and hopeless. As Im sad and hopeless, I have no motivation to do schoolwork. I have been trying different medications for a couple years and they really fluctuate.

Ive tried to hide it from my friends by making jokes about my insecurities and my low self esteem. I want to talk to them about it but they might not take it seriously because Ive joked so much about it.

    "No one respects me or believes in me I have this close female friend who I like but I know probably doesnt like me in a romantic way. Ive asked before, and she turned me down. But shes probably the person Im closest too and who I trust the most in the world. But I figure she doesnt see a future with me because I dont have a career or because Im still hung up on my ex. And I cant go to Facebook or Snapchat anymore because it either gets misunderstood and I get messaged with concern, or I get completely ignored and feel rejected from it. I dont know. It really does feel like as a guy I can only be loved and sought after if I give some or create something that gets peoples attention. Im not loved or sought after for who I am. Thats why Im alone right now in my life, why I seem to be unsuccessful at dating or meeting people. It sucks because that feels like the way for me to get out of this funk that and seeking God. I just dont want another person to tell me to be happy alone, or to tell me to let go. The thing Ive wanted was for someone unprompted to tell me that I mattered to them, that I make their life better by being me. Ive told myself those things, but it fades away when I have less to show for a life I dont want to be living, because I cant right now make things come true or be the only one believing I have a future that seems impossible.",
    "I want to go to the doctor about depression Ill spare the backstory, but after 15 years of feeling mostly bad and two attempts at counselling therapy Im prepared to give medication a go. Im not sure how to talk to a doctor about this I REALLY dont want to be seen as an attentionseeker and I have a habit of playingdown how I feel you get real good at acting over 15 years. Im in Wales in the UK by the way if that helps. I rarely got to the doctor about actual health issues since its so difficult to get an appointment and you only get to say about three words during your speedy 5minute slot with a doctor who youve never seen before ugh, its kinda free so I should stop moaning. Last time I spoke to my mom about it sparing some details Ive never told her about feeling suicidal and selfharm I do she just said Im probably feeling down because I had a lot of work to do at uni and I have a cold  Ive exhausted the other options. I hate having to seek help because men arent supposed to show emotions. Every single piece of depression info online just has to make sure they tell you that dEpReSsIoN iS mOrE cOmMoN iN wOmEn. Thanks for that. I just hope they suggest medication. My two experiences with therapy werent good I just desparately wanted to tell someone my whole story. All of it. I want someone who will listen to me for once. Instead I found it so hard to say anything personal or really true, sitting in horrible little rooms full of Buddha statues and pictures of sunsets being glared at by the therapist for getting upset while she sits there scribbling down notes you never get to see and and looking at the clock so she get get on to the next gulible sucker who pays 40 for 50 minutes of spilling personal information. I know Im a bad person I just hope medication will enable me to not be. Im sorry Im rambling since going to university Im 26 btw I have been feeling worse than ever before. Do you think its a good idea to talk to a doctor about this? If so, how? Thank you.",

I have a problem with a friend in which I could really use some advice about. In mid dec. I told my nearest friends, that I need to be alone for a while. I was waiting for starting in a treatment with some therapeuts, and needed to step back since all the expectations from my surrounding became too much and left me up with anxiety. I cancelled christmas, new years eve and went on the sick leave. Ive been depressed since the beginning of last year maybe months before acutally when my now ex, broke up with me. And this has been the BEST thing Ive ever done to myself. I do have contact with my mum, who supports me 100. And a little with my dad, whom I struggle with. And this leaves me to focus on how to deal with him, since that relation in itself has been so toxic for me as well  so much that I didnt had energy to focus on it. Because I have so little energy atm. This one friend, lets call her ST is the one Im having troubles with. December was tough. A family member choosed to not talk with me anymore, December should have been anniversary day w. my ex  it reminds me of my sad little family, not so many friends and two earlier suicide tempts another ex  a dear friend. So Dec in general is a REALLY tough month for me. I went on the sick leave this Dec, because it just became to much. I then called ST to tell her about my choice  also telling her that earlier this year I was so depressed, that I tried to take my own life. But that Im not there anymore, but fear to end there if I dont take myself seriously. She got mad and told me that being on the sick leave is the most stupid thing ever  because I was ALMOST recovering, and almost starting up my own business etc. I got angry and told her that I just needed my friends to believe in me  and believe me when I said that this choice was the right one for me.",
    "Feeling Lost I have Anxiety, PTSD, Bipolar Depression, Pulmonary Embolism, Obesity, and Mobility issues, and I am only 35Mliving in the Seattle Area.

Its hard for me to go to medical appointments because I am just tired of the frequency, and if there is bad news, its only me and my shoulders. I dont have anyone to share the burden with. I have a giant hole inside of me, and I cant fix it. This past week or so, I have had this sense of feeling lost, and I have been sleeping almost all day and up most of the night. I am homeless, jobless, and I am also semidisabled. I use a fourwheel walker to help me get around long distances and a cane around the apartment. I have been staying with friends since I lost everything in a fire in February 2016. Because of my weight and health issues, homeless shelters wont take me because I am a highrisk liability.

    "Can't eat or drink In the middle of a pretty bad depression spiral right now and just cant eat. after two days of not eating, I started a food log to make sure that I am at least getting enough for basic survival, and installed an app on my phone to remind me to drink water, but it is just getting harder to ingest anything. I saw these weird emergency ration bars that seem to have all the calories nutrients you need for a day in a few small bites and ordered those. I dont know if they will help or anything, but its becoming harder every day. I feel like a failure for not being able to do basic human things, which only pushes the depression spiral further. I find myself playing this sick game where I see how long I can put off eating or drinking, which is really just a facade to make me feel like I have some control over the matter. I just dont know what to do anymore to not feel this awful. I only have two modes anymore, sad and numb, and I am just so damn tired all the time. I constantly find myself wishing for someone to just come out of the shadows and kill me, since I cant seem to do it myself. Maybe the loss of appetite is my body trying to do it for me.

I nearly threw my phone at a wall because it kept crashing when I was trying to install a self help app. Im lost. I find myself rejecting any opportunity to get help. I dont know what to do.",

I moved to a different country to pursue my career when I was 18 now Im 20 and I feel like the last 3 years of my life are a blur is like my head stopped making memories the second I left home.

    "I don’t want to take out my negative feelings on my bf Ive been struggling with depression, PTSD, anxiety, and anger issues for a while now, and I keep feeling down and I dont know how to not take out my anger at my bf by getting snappy with him or saying something kind of mean. He knows all about it and hes been super patient with me, but I know its not something that should continue, regardless of him being alright with it at the time. So Im not sure what to do",
    "I’m dying inside 💔😩 I wish I could stop all this major pain I feel. I want to impress but I also could care less about who thinks what. I wanted to make you feel proud, but we see how that went for all of us. I try hard everyday to make myself proud of my achievements but its just not worth it as much as it used to be. I used to be so proud and so excited to try my hardest for the things I loved, but notice that all of a sudden it doesnt seem to matter anymore kills me. Where did all my friends, family and love life go. Down the drain it feels like. So where do I go from here, do I keep trying or do I go get help bc I just dont feel like I can do much of this alone for much longer. Do I give up completely? To feel so damn alone is crushing me and to feel I mean less and less every day isnt exactly healthy. You wanna know how I made it out of my moms hell hole psycho rage house. Ill tell you, Im forever damaged and looking for full approval on things. I only end up attracting the worst people and I cant seem to keep a solid person in my life bc she ruined my way of judgment. My aunt tries hard to fix what I cant even fix myself. I just want to feel loved by friends and someone I hold so near and dear and care for. But to do that, I HAVE TO HAVE FRIENDS, and NO ANXIETY ABOUT MAKING FRIENDS, AND SOMEONE NOT HURTING ME. I fear everyday that Ill fall back into my old habits and go suicidal. I almost want to know what its like to do drugs and get away from this world. I feel the pain rush through my body like electricity. I practically enjoyed that one girls night that I got so wasted that I was slurring my words for once and passed out naked in my own house. I enjoy darker things and its getting to dark to decipher whats ok or not anymore. I hold in so much anger and pain that If I let it all out Id probably cry for a week straight. Sleep cry sleep cry, it would be the worst cycle.",

    "Cleaning service? I feel lots of shame posting this. I pretty much live in my partners room she lives with roommates. Both of us have depression amp anxiety symptoms flaring up, and she has chronic pain. Weve been very isolated to our room. Its already been cluttered and disorganized by her move 1 year ago, and since we have very little energy, its more and more cluttered, including boxes of takeout. Its state affects us very much and though weve tried again and again to gain motivation and energy to at least do small things, we havent been able to do much. We talked a few times about reaching out for someone to clean and reorganize our room. I also know a few skilltrading groups where I could ask for help, and offer some kind of compensation. I also thought of asking friends for help, but Im scared of imposing. We dont have that much money either, but honestly we havent been able to do much for a while now and I just need help to take a step forward. I just feel like Im being very lazy doing so. And Im not sure where to start. Did anyone considered or tried doing something like that? Does it make sense?",

Not only that, I have a big college entrance exam coming up in June so Im really stressed and every time I fail at something, I feel like a freaking loser and that I should go kill myself. I know I should go to the doctor but I cant because as mentioned above, I have issues with my family, especially my mom, plus, mental illnesses or therapy isnt common here Im Asian so the best thing I can do now is to get my mind off negativity by doing stuffs, at least until I can get my own money to go to the doctor myself I read, watching movies, running, programming, learning Spanish but I need more.

    "Depression Treatment Options MDD for the past 2 years. Bipolar, depression, and anxiety all run in my family very prevelently, but none have received any kind of treatment except lithium for a bipolar grandparent. Im currently considered treatment resistant. Onto my 5th antidepressant now. Done SSRIs, SNRIs, Wellbutrin, and Buspar dont know why my doc thought that one was a good idea, I dont have anxious symptoms. Im beginning to think oral medications are not the route for me unless perhaps a tetracyclic or MAOI works out. Id be interested in trying lithium because I know it has helped a family member and I have also been mis?diagnosed as bipolar, so maybe it could work? Im going to bring that up to my new psychiatrist tomorrow. TMS and ECT sound like great options except the price tag. My insurance would only cover half, so Id still be paying upwards of 10k for treatment. Not something I can afford. So I need to look for something else that I could possibly try thats cheaper. And yes, Ive done psychotherapy and group therapy, and it doesnt help in the slightest. Ive looked into alternate medicine like acupuncture, although i doubt its efficacy my theory is that it works solely due to the placebo effect. and that hasnt even worked for things i thought would work for me. Perhaps clinical trials could be an option, but thats not necessarily treatment for me. Ive been suggested to try an outpatient program or check into a psych ward but Ive heard bad things about them. Plus, Im not sure how my treatment would be any better than just going to a psychiatrist on my own. Please let me know your experiences or suggestions! I am willing to try anything to get better, and Ive been researching my options, but have heard very little experience past the basic medication side of things.",

    "Placing too much on outside help? Hello, I 20m am a Junior in college. I have dealt with social anxiety, self esteem issues, and most recently depression for nearly half my life. It was a result of reactionary behavior I caused my own problems and I have never been able to shake it, as I tell myself I am incapable of change. Cause yourself problems once, you will sure as hell cause them again I have been spiraling more or less over the last few years, and only now am I sane enough to look at my lifelong issues. Unfortunately, I recently moved to a new city where I know no one. The loneliness has recently gotten to my head, and that combined with the stressfulness of college has me incredibly overwhelmed. Suicide has been on my mind more and more lately until I told myself today I would do it. But here I am. I have an appointment with a therapy clinic lined up on 59 May 9th  USA, but I do feel guilty to an extent. All that goes through my head upon dealing with my problems is tell the therapist and they will assist you in making sense of it. This has me feel irresponsible and ridiculous. There has been many people in life who cant afford help and have gotten along just fine. Its your life, and at the end of the day its on you to fix it. Yet at the same time I am so lost. All that goes through my head is my inner critic, saying its pointless. Sorry to ramble. My point being, those who have had success beating their issues on their own, what techniquesroutinesactivities did you use  partake in? What helped change your perspectives? Any feedback is appreciated thanks for reading if for some reason you got this far",

I dont think Im depressed or anything, but if I was given the option to never have existed I would take it. I never asked for life and I dont think I want it. The only thing keeping me going I suppose is the trauma I would inflict if people found my body in my apartment. Besides that my parents spent a lot of money on my education and without me to provide for them when I finish they may end up in poverty. Im trying to do better but some things just seem to be taking me 10 steps back the moment I try harder. I think Im growing number to life. I have a final tomorfow and I dont care.",

My 26M ex gf 26F cheated on me and left me for some guy she had only known for 3 weeks. I loved her so much. We had been together for almost 7 years. We had plans to get married and buy a home together. To travel together have kids and start a family together She abandoned me and the dog we raised together for some low life with no career or education that pursued her knowing we were in a committed relationship. It hurts. There are so many memories of the good times we spent together. I was so close with her family. She had always said she couldnt imagine her life without me. Now shes off with this horrible person acting like theyre soulmates. I know I deserve better than someone who would cheat on me and lie about it. I am just still having trouble believing she actually did this to me and that shes gone and never coming back. I was such a good boyfriend. I made her breakfast in bed and surprised her with dinner when she had a late shift. I would plan special surprises for the holidays and birthdays. Yet she still cheated on me and left me.

    "Both me and my spouse are depressed To sum things up, my husband works in retail, Im disabled and cant get disability pay, were poor, but getting by, neither of us have any schooling nor can afford it, he doesnt know what he wants to do if he does go to school, while I feel if I decide to go, it would be a waste of money because I wont be able to work. Plus, theres no guarantee Im mentally fit for it. Neither of us have any drive or passion for life and the only thing really keeping both of us going is each other. Were both obese because hes too tired after work to do anything and my condition is sporadic so its unsafe for me to walk alone. Neither of us even want to go anywhere, anyways. We eat for comfort or when were bored and neither of us can really muster the effort to make food a lot of the time so we subsist on junk. Little things tire us out easily me from my condition, but us both from depression. Im diagnosed and receiving treatment, he isnt. Because of the pandemic, therapy for me is spotty at best  just went three months without therapy and had my first session last week, but my therapist missed our last session earlier this week, so Im worried shes sick again. Getting my husband in for therapy or psychiatry right now is impossible. New patients arent being accepted because paperwork needs to be signed in person. We do have a dog, but he fits in with us way too well. Our dog is afraid of the outside if hes out more than 10 minutes, then demands to be picked up or he wont move. He enjoys car rides and likes being held for walks but my back and heart cant take the position, and he doesnt want my husband to hold him  hes my velcro dog. Then if there are any people, dogs, noises, or wind, he starts to panic, so I do too, he usually helps stabilize my moods, but were both afraid of people so it turns into a feedback loop.",

    "How can I support the man I'm dating who is depressed? The guy Im dating has been having a tough week due to two things happening and I think it has triggered his depression hes told me about his mental illnesses before. Our relationship has been amazing so far but this week he has been really quiet with me and doesnt want to talk, and now it has come to leaving my messages on read. Im really concerned about him because I dont want him to feel he has to suffer alone, but I also understand that everyone copes with things differently, and perhaps he just needs to get his thoughts in order before talking to me again. Ive sent messages telling him Ill always be there for him and nothing will push me away, and I know how rough it can be because some of my family members also suffer from depression. Ive also told him I will give him space to think and get his mind in order and that he can message me anytime he feels like talking, but I do want to keep checking in on him over the next few days to show Im there for him. If anyone else has any advice on how I can support him, then it would be greatly appreciated, thank you.",
    "I don’t know what to do I 19 have been severely depressed for about 6 years undiagnosed. At around the same time my depression started, I was pulled out of public school by my mom so she could homeschool me. Her idea of homeschooling is to not teach me and instead expects me to be motivated enough to work completely on my own with no deadlines. I dont have any motivation to live, let alone finish my schooling. I am almost 20 and have not graduated high school. I only need to CLEP out of three more classes to graduate but the task feels so overwhelmingly impossible and I know Im running out of time. I feel like I have already ruined my life so why finish? Depression has fucked up my brain so bad I fear it is damaged beyond repair. Im not living anymore. The only thing I do now is scroll through social media all day and think about possibly doing my schoolwork. And to think I was once the smart kid. The one advantage I have is that I started taking college classes when I was 14 and have nearly enough credits for an associates degree. I might be able to transfer to a 4year school but I dont know who will be willing to accept me since i never took the ACT or SAT. Even if I did get in to a good university, what the hell would I major in? I had a few interests in mind but depression has taken them away and subjects that I once found intriguing no longer bring me joy. I have no idea where to start. I just really, really need advice and a reason to keep going. Thanks for listening.",

Weve known each other for 12 years and now were both in the same university. He has panic attacks and a very unbalanced cycle. Im spending most of my time with him, cooking for him, holding him through his attacks and trying to take care of him in general. Problem is that Im struggling with my emotions. I have a lot more work on my plate than he does which irks him as hes been the academic topper all these years. So he doesnt want me to stay in his room while I send emails or do any work in general.

The issue is that I find myself unmotivated to do much of anything and when I do engage in activities I dont really find much value in participating in them because I dontenjoy them. Because of this, it causes a selffulfilling prophecy as I dont make the effort to do things because I find nothing enjoyable.

    "Realized today just how much my depression as fucked up my teeth. Anyone else feel like a piece of shit when stuff like this happens? Ive been trying to take better care of myself one step at a time. I used to go a couple days without brushing my teeth for a few months and havent flossed in years because I was never really told why it is so important.

I cant afford an extra dental bills and dont qualify for state or federal assistance... I guess what Im looking for by posting this here is someone to tell me that Im not alone and not a disgusting piece of trash for having this happen. For context Im 24 and smoke about 6 cigarettes a day, which is why I feel extra shitty because I feel like Ive ruined my teeth forever. Yes I know quitting smoking will help, but Im trying to undo bad habits one at a time and start to take better care of myself, and quitting smoking and dealing with mental health problems is really fucking hard.

    "I feel fed up please listen to me? Hi, Since a young age I had a big need to be in showbiz. I was part of the chorus in school and did some plays. People thought I was good. Sadly it went nowhere like I had no family with connections. I made this friend who was a child actor but he had the looks and I lacked that department. Years later, I am living in the USA struggling the same thing and being older. I love to act. I really do. I try a lot but I cant do an American accent and people dismiss me or even make fun of me. I keep trying to reach out to people to make projects and I get ghosted. I moved to a big city to get opportunity and it is so competitive with crappy entry level jobs. I have done so many labor gigs to be able to survive, worked 24 hours straight and 0 acting opportunity. I have a job that gives me little freedom working 6 hours for 6 days a week and even there upper management writes me up for petty things when I work so hard and can lose that job anytime. I dont like anything else other than acting and it is me, all alone. I have a few friends but they deal with their own issues like alcoholism and such. I see people on my social media or my friends friends who get acting opportunities in indie films and such and they do things that I could and makes me wonder... Why they dont cast me for anything? What is wrong with me? I have been to acting classes and I have barely gotten any feedback. I hear things like my accent or before Ive heard I was chubby and ugly and I fixed it since I am fit now and put some fillers. It is just I feel nobody values me... It is easy to think so since my very own parents abandoned me and wanted no responsibility. Any comfort would help please.",

    "Running out of options At 30 ywars old, Ive been on a total of 8 antidepressants and anxiety meds since I was 14. A lot of things work for a while and then just...dont anymore. Ive been telling my psychiatrist that my current meds work fine, because the last thing I tried had horrible side effects and I didnt want to go through more of that again. In truth, Im not doing well. My depression is very much chemical and not situational. I feel like crying all the time for straight up no reason. I feel like...how much more can I try? Is the rest of my life going to be just a cycle of medications until theres nothing left? Does anyone else feel this? Have you found other things to try?",

Ive been depressive for a long time,have a LOT of insecurities and anxienty recently..

Today was litterbox day and I change my geckos water and check his temperatures every day, usually. I didnt do anything for my gecko or clean the litterbox. Sometimes I forget to feed my cat and give her fresh water for a few hours too. Am I a terrible person? I cant give them away, theres nowhere really for them to go. Theyre the only reason Im still alive and I cant even do the bare minimum for them. Im going to bed so if I get responses I wont reply till morning. Sorry.",
    "I could use some help ;D Its not what you know. But who you know. Been ghosted after my 3rd interview. What makes it worse, is knowing who was hired the industry is very connected online. Said other person had less experience and a worse degree than I. I must really suck at interviews or lack enthusiasm. All feedback I get is, you were great, but we went with someone else or you lacked enthusiasm when I smiled and did my best to be interested during the entire interview. The gaming industry is very altrustic. Ive been stuck as a permatemp for a 1 year 7 months. I have a first degree and a lot of experience. Employers still dont see my value and I dont know what else to do. Ive turned to alchohol to numb the pain, and its gotten to the point I dont care if im fired and lose my job. Im greatful for the opportunity, but im stuck, not learning anything new and I have been rejected from multiple opportunities at the company im currently at. I constantly aim yo better myself by asking for more experience, but im ignored. Then why am I kept and renewed contracts? Make it make sense. At this point, from my already nonexistent selfesteem, ive concluded im unlikable, too honest and its not what I know, but who I dont know. Alchohol is literally my best friend. I such at networking and hate the idea of sucking up to potentialy get somewhere or nowhere. I hate the gaming industry, and I hate what its done to me.",
    "This is gross but I really need help Ive just woken up from a months long depression hole today. I was getting presentable, going to work and taking care of my cat but thats pretty much it. No cleaning my room. No watering my plants. My room is beyond disgusting now its full of trash and dishes and just the most disgusting garbage. And flies. So many goddamn flies. They look like little fruit flies or gnats and I have no idea how to get rid of them.

I know this is gross and Im sorry I just feel so ashamed that I let things get like this and I dont know where else to ask for help. Does anyone have any advice thats helped them with cleaning once they crawl out of the depression hole? Any advice on how to keep on it when youre in the hole? Any advice on how to get rid of the flies? Im just crying in my disgusting room rn, I have no idea what to do and this cant have been good for my poor cat.",

    "I can't handle sexualization double standards So, I happen to be a gay dude. And, I think I am going insane from not knowing how to handle the fact that males in media are never ever allowed to be sexualized the same ways females are all the time. Males showing off their ass and legs, wearing thongs or tights or fetishizing impractical clothes designed for the purpose of being fetishizing with skinrevealing stuff, and have them pose in compromising positions... thats never ever allowed. Yet, it happens with female characters all the damn time. I am 32 years old, and been speaking openly about this for many, MANY years. Ive had all sorts of explanations being told for why this is the case. And no matter how much its explained to me, it still pisses me off we dont get exceptions from the rules. I got most recently triggered by this today. I was sitting with some other dudes, and they happen to be straight. Suddenly, one of them starts a Youtube music video on the TV in front of us, and its one where tons of females are oversexualized, while NONE of the males are at all sexualized. I pointed it out, and the dude playing it first says I should ignore that and focus on the music. I said I cant. He then said hes sure theres stuff like that with dudes as well. I said I have been looking for it and never ever found anything. He then said I should be at least happy for HIM for getting this. At that point, I just broke and had to leave. I hate how I cant let go of this obsession. I hate not being able to just let it go and be happy. But a part of me doesnt want to let it go, because the double standard is driving me insane and makes it feel like only heterosexual dudes deserves being catered to. Please, help... I dont know what to do anymore, I cant handle this.",
    "My partner doesn't take my mental health seriously I have depression, my partner of 5 years knows it well. Things are not going well with me in life. I used to do self harm before I started my treatment. Im jobless and cannot afford therapy now, living with my toxic family and losing relatives to covid is taking a huge toll on my mental health. Ive told my partner multiple times that Im extremely depressed and want to die and he just ignores it everytime. I dont know what to do, Ive no one to talk about it, my mom literally is always disgusted by me and she makes sure I know it 4times a day. I have friends but none with whom I can talk about this. I dont know what to do anymore. My partner is extremely rude and disrespectful towards my mental health. He never went to any session with me even after I asked him multiple times.

    "Tomorrow is my son's first birthday party. All I want to do is hide. He is our only child. Everyone keeps telling me to have fun and enjoy it. I will be expected to be there and be happy when the time comes. I am expected to take a lot of pictures because it is so cute and he only turns one once. Instead, I will be dying inside, waiting for the time when everyone leaves and I can go back to my safe place. Away from people so I dont bring them down. Ive thought about doing suicide by cop a few times. But even then I think about how that would make them feel. I wouldnt want to do that to someone else. I wouldnt want to risk my actions causing someone else to possibly go down the road I am on now. So instead, I suffer. Always someone around but always feeling alone. How do I make it all go away?",
    "Depressed International Student; need help Hi, Ill try to explain my situation as best as I can and I will highly appreciate if you can read it completely. In any case, Ill try to summarize everything in a TLDR at the bottom. Thanks for your time. ampx200B I am an international student who is stuck overseas in my home country India due to COVID from the last one and half year. I am studying in a good university on a student loan which is huge. I come from a lowermiddle class family and my parents cant even speak English. My parents have very conservative Indian mentality and it is impossible for them to understand my situation. Just after my high school, I was selected into very prestigious engineering colleges in India called IIT. I studied there for an year and got super depressed as I came to understand how the real life is. I decided to take a transfer to a very good university in Australia. I thought it would make me feel better but it did come with a hefty student loan. I was a kid I guess, I dont think there is anything that can make me feel better. I am currently in my last year and working towards writing my honours thesis. I have been pretty stressed about general life and how exactly I will repay my loan and live a normal life. I have tried applying to a lot of internships but I got more than 50 rejections already and I have no more motivation to apply anywhere now. I dont feel anything at all. The only reason why I study or do any work is to get high marks. Thats it. Very recently last month or two, I have been even slacking off in the study part. I have also started smoking cigarettes and doing marijuana edibles every other day. Every day, I wake up at 10 already tired and swearing about everything in my mind, I live at my parents home rn. I attend a few zoom group project meetings, staying silent mostly and trying to look like I did the minimal amount of work to not get thrown out of the group. Then I try to feel better, make a huge list of assignments coming up and write down how much is each of them worth. I start working on something and feel it is totally pointless.",
    "The Effects of Depression on a Relationship [ADVICE] I am in relationship with someone who has major depression. When it gets really bad for him, it gets bad for us. He can be a little mean, irritable. These times feel the loneliest for me. I cant help but feel sad as a consequence at times. I understand that in these moments he isnt himself nonetheless it still hurts. I am generally busy and there is distance between us. I feel guilty at times I cant do more and feel like I am being pulled everywhere in my life in general. I feel numb and sadness which I try like hell to ignore in myself to preclude any ideas of seeing a breakup as a resolution to how I am feeling. I do love him, his pain is my pain. There is a certain emotional fortification developed when you are in these types of relationships perhaps that is why I feel like I am not allowed to crumble, need or want especially when it gets really bad. Is there any better way to deal with this? with us? my loneliness? How can you be happy in life when your partner isnt? How do you share a life when your partner doesnt have the energy at times to pick the phone or talk to you?",

I dont have anybody I can talk to....no friends, no trustables or anything. My parents dont believe the existence of mental health in children so If I tell them that I am experiencing extreme mood swings and depression I get the answer dont be sad or if you will be sad it will become a habit. I need to get back to normal quickly because I am having an important exam. And my parents have indirectly told me that they are going to judge me. I am always feeling hopeless and anxious and worried and depressed. I feel like crying the entire day but I dont because it doesnt changes anything.",

    "I feel like I can’t talk to anyone Recently my boyfriend the only person Ive talked to about my seasonal depression told me that he thinks Im too emotionally dependent on him.

I dont know what to do, I dont want to be emotionally dependent on someone but I cant do this alone either. Ive cried myself to sleep so many times since he told me, Ive wanted to self harm again so badly, and I cant talk about it to anyone. I tried telling him that I just feel worse and all he said was I dont know what to say. I guess my reaction to what he said just proves that I am emotionally dependent on him but I just need someone I trust to talk to, but recently my best friend has become someone I barely recognize.

    "Feeling Super Stuck - Would Love Some Advice I grew up in an abusive home, and was abused basically daily from about the age of four until I left at 16. Turns out that the only other abusive relationship Ive ever been in is with the person Im currently married to. There was never physical abuse in my marriage, and my childhood trauma definitely factors in here. I could go on for pages describing the history and the current dynamics, but Ill keep to the point by saying that Ive made huge strides in understanding my mental health, that I know myself quite well, and that the chances of me being happy and fulfilled in the marriage are zero. Theres been a mountain of therapy, tonnes of conversations, over several years. Ive been the this is fine meme for about four years now and I just cant do it any more. If it wasnt for our daughter, I would have broken up long ago. Ive stayed because of her, and Ive done my best to make the relationship work. Its clearly not working though, and Im feeling painfully stuck and Im miserable. I have every reason in the universe to leave except for one reason, and shes an amazing little human that I cant imagine abandoning. So yeah, I have no frigging idea what to do. Staying in this relationship is a terrible option. I cant afford to live in Houston without a job. Working remotely for a company in Canada is an option, but most pay terribly and I havent had any luck landing one yet. Homelessness is technically an option, but not really. I could go back to my old job in Canada any time, but thats a 23 hour drive away not counting traffic and bathroom breaks. I dont have anyone in my life I can talk to about this, so Im hoping for a little bit of emotional support here. This situation has me feeling unresolvable stuck, and for the first time in my life at times Im feeling desperate and miserable. I know the right thing is to find a way through it with my wife for the sake of my daughter, but honestly I dont think my soul can take it. Any suggestions?",

    "Successful, but what is the point? Im not sure what to do, so Im writing here. I am nearly 50 years old, and a nurse in a management position currently pursuing a higher degree. Ive been with my husband 30 years and we have grown children. By all accounts, Im successful. Life isnt perfect but it could be  and has been  worse. Much worse. But every day I cant shake the feeling that I just dont want to live. Ive had depression probably since high school, and it worsened during different life events, but nothing severe is happening now. During the worst of times, I didnt feel this strongly about life just being completely meaningless and, really... what the hell is the point? Its exhausting. Im finding myself just stuck at work, unable to be as productive as I need to be. But Im doing well in my college courses  straight As.

I have been to counseling before, and it helped during that situation, but I honestly dont see how it will help me now. Before I started the college courses, I had found myself looking up how to hang myself on a doorknob. I know the warning signs of suicide  Im a nurse! I scared myself. So I started college. Now Im two semesters in, and just the other day I was considering how I could kill myself and make it look like an accident so my family wouldnt have to live with my suicide. Yet earlier today, I was laughing so hard I couldnt even tell the story about something funny my dogs did last night. Its amazing to me that I can be this absolutely hopeless, yet still laugh like that. So anyone else feel like this? Did you get past it? And how?",
    "I’ve lost track of my life and I don’t know how to get it back RANTREQUESTING SUPPORT OR ADVICE Ive 24F been struggling with depression off and on for the past 6 years. My mood was getting better since I broke up with my exboyfriend a month ago, but recently I feel like Ive lost track of my life completely. The breakup was the fist time I choose my own needs above someone elses and it felt like a step towards freedom. Meanwhile Im kinda dating somebody I have an extremely strong connection with. Weve had a short but intense relationship in the past but lost connection. We started talking again right before I finally decided to breakup with my ex Ive considered it many times but never had the courage to actually do it. I strongly believe that talking to this person made me decide to breakup with my ex. Besides that it really feelsfelt like the universe wanted us to connect again in a romantic way. Weve been dating for the past 2,5 weeks and Ive never been this confused in my life. One day I feel so liberated, loved, happy and absolutely in love with the person Im dating. The next day Im full of guilt, confused about my feelings for my ex and extremely depressed again. Guilt because I feel like Ive done my ex wrong while I know I didnt. Our relationship was not equal and mainly based on me taking care of him financially and emotionally. I feel like I abandoned him and I hate myself for that. Confused because I miss him so much and still feel love for him and the person Im currently dating, both in a romantic way. Depressed because I dont know how to deal with these feelings and because I think I messed up again. I feel like my life is a constant pattern of failure and making bad decisions unconsciously. Im stuck and lost. I keep telling myself that the most important thing is to be happy on your own, that you dont need a significant other to be happy. I know I tend to start difficult and ambiguous relationships in order to avoid other complicated feelings I actually have to deal with like a breakup. Im very aware of my coping but at the same time I feel like I genuinely need to experience if a relationship with the person Im dating will work out or not.",

    "I feel like I don't deserve to be sad, but I am. I understand this may seem silly. Everyone has their own issues and struggles, their own obstacles and problems, etc. But I truly have a very blessed life, I am attending college, living with my father he and his wife have very respectable income. I do not have to pay rent, I have an abundance of friends who care about me a lot, I have hobbies that I excel in, I am at least relatively proactive in taking care of myself eating breakfast, lunch dinner, exercise, etc., I dont partake in selfdestructive behaviors examples smoking, drinking, etc. So why do I feel sad? More importantly, why do I feel GUILTY for feeling sad? I look around and see people in situations light years worse than mine, and that is a big part of why I find it so hard to talk about this. I start to feel down and I want to speak up but my down is just the majority of the norm for some people, and I feel like I am unable to be taken seriously because of this. But even more than just worrying that other people will not take me seriously, I feel like I can not take myself seriously, and it feels beyond pathetic. I hate myself so much when I watch people in terrible situations still trying their best to do the best for themselves and others around them. I feel like I have such a golden opportunity at life yet Im just wasting it in self sorrow and self pity. This realization has pushed me to an extent. Like I said, I have hobbies that I excel in, I go running and try to take care of myself the best I can. I do my best to help around when I can, be a contributing member of communities and generally just be nice. Yet I still find myself feeling like its not enough and that Im just not worth it. How am I supposed to work on my problems when I dont even know what they are anymore? Im at a very low point in my life. I manage to put on a strongfront for my friends and family, and dont get me wrong, I am truly happy on a respectable amount of days.

Im trying to weigh the proscons of trying to get myself admitted and so far Ive only been able to come up with cons My worriesconcerns  I have no idea how much a stay or checking myself in would cost. I believe that this worrying would leave me off a lot worse than I am now. Id also be worrying about what my friendsfamily are thinking while Im gone and how Im just causing them unnecessary stress itd be a shock for them as they dont know any of this  Id also be worrying about missing my classesassignmentsa midterm and how I would catch up afterward  I feel like Id be generally miserable for however long Im there  I think it might make me miserable enough to actually commit suicide after I leave, although I feel like I wouldnt be able to effectively kill myself and then would have to go through the whole process of hospitalization over again. I just dont see that many pros in checking myself in, but I dont really know what else to do. Could anyone whos gone through the process give some guidance? Thank you.",
    "Life’s going downhill and everything that happens is mainly my fault For starters Im 13 years old. Im in the 7th grade and this issue has been going on for what Id say about a year now. I dont know if whats going on even is depression, maybe Im just being edgy. To be frank, I have no idea anymore. The more I stress about it the more I try talking about it with my friends, and sometimes they ignore it, other times they tell me to stop being emo. Also, FYI, this will be really long. The fact of the matter is that things havent been going well. We can start at my grades. You see, my brother age 25 is a collage dropout and my sister age 21 is still doing great and Im happy for her. The thing is that because my brother had dropped out of collage he has a job now and is starting to get back on track and is still living with my parents and struggling, I feel this pressure that I need to do well and be the best I can to not end up like him. Im sure thats normal, but the one problem is my mother. I always try to satisfy her, seeing the smile and satisfaction on her face is my dream, but she never seems to be satisfied. If I brought home Bs that wasnt good enough. If I got an answer wrong on my test even though I still got a good grade it wasnt good enough because I got something wrong. When I brought home my interim, I got 3 Bs and 4 As and when she saw, all she did was ask if I needed help because my grades were dropping. It hurt me. She wants me to become an orthodontist. When I brought home this report thingie on my level 15 on english and writing, I got a level 5. Only 7 of students in my state got that. However there was also one for science and math, I got a level 4 on that, which is what most people in my state got. When she saw, she told me to do better because I math and science are more important for becoming a orthodontist. I feel helpless. My next issue is this incident that happened with my crush.",
    "I need help, TW SuçI∂e Well Hello to all the people reading this. so Im going to have to be careful with the information I disclose, as my situation is precarious to say the least. So Ive made some mistakes, I hurt some people in ways that arent bad but I had to make it clear that I am not an angel, nor am I the devil. When I hurt those people, a lot of people, people who really dont like me but have nothing to do with this started finding ways to ruin my life. I was accused of leaking a 14 year olds nudes, raping someone, lying about my age, and sending my nudes to people who didnt want it the reality they asked. Some guy accused me on his story publicly and since he has a ton of followers and people on his side so people immediately took his side of the story, without ever taking a deeper look. Ive gotten my own nudes leaked to almost everyone in this city, outside the country, friends relatives family. The pics and vids were sent to my parents as evidence and then my cousins and extended family. A tiktok was posted with my nudes in it and in like 3 hours it had more than 80K views, and by the time it had got taken down it had reached 380K views, and was then shared privately between the hundreds of thousands of people who saved it. Everywhere. In addition, Ive gotten death threats, people trying to find where I live and where I go to school. Ive lost every single one of my friends, not one has remained. I feel so lost and confused. Some part of me feels like Im the bad guy and this is the consequence of my own actions, I mean I wasnt always 100 clear with my intentions. But then on the other hand theres people who are playing this just like a game. All they want to do is ruin me and since they have no direct evidence for their claims so instead they ruin my life. I cant feel safe anywhere, and hearing and reading what people are saying about me, about my nudes, about my private conversations with people just makes me hate life even more.",
    "Felt like I just should die, even if I don't want to. Hello guys, It must be like three days that Im registered on Reddit sorry if I say something weird or wrong, english isnt my first language, you can correct me if there is a mistake and you feel like it, thats not a problem I hope and I was trying to give an advice to people like just an advice that I believed was good to follow if a person was in a bad situation with someone with wrong intentions someday. My point was only to help, and I never said in the comment in question that Ive got all the knowledge in the world and that my advice was an order or whatever. But yet, somebody just told me that I should not have said what I said the advice because in her case which was a very bad one, like a situation I hope nobody would live, even if I know that everyday people unfortunately experience it and I had too, but I never said that in my comment or in reply to her because I didnt have to and whatever and I felt really attacked by her. Because she made me really feel like a bad person, as if I was even coupable of what would have happen to her in the past, and she told that BECAUSE she did not do what I was giving as an advice, she lived. But if she did what I have said, she would have been dead, and she made me feel really guilty about it. The point is, that I was just trying to help and she didnt have to talk to me like that. I didnt knew where to post what I am posting right now, because for the record, Ive been depressed for more than ten years and I experienced like, almost one time a year one time could be hours, days, weeks or months of me feeling like I really should kill myself. And Im even in one of this episode for a few weeks and everyday I try to help at least one person a day. Not to feel better about myself, but because I want to help as many people as I can and I know that it could help.",
    "Life’s going downhill and everything that happens is mainly my fault Im vulgar, perverted, violent, etc. And then, not to repeat myself, but everything is still my fault. If theres an argument I started it. If something bad happened Im the one who did something illegal. If Im not 100 perfect like my friends Im a failure. Im just done with life, and as much as I want to end it, Christianity wont allow it. The very thing thats saving me even with my parents I wouldve killed myself a LONG time ago if it werent for my Christian faith is also imprisoning me. Again, Im not sure if Im depressed, its possible Im just being emo. But if anyone can provide any advice as to what to do, Id greatly appreciate it. Have a good night.",

I always end up going back to her because I lover her so much and was the only person to ever make me feel legitimately loved. Recently, she told me she wasnt going to be answering me much on Snapchat because she has final exams. Which is fair. Yet, I see her on her snap map shes active fairly often whilst also posting on her story. Ill be on delivered for hours on end and this isnt the first time this has happened. However, when we do talk, she tells me she loves me and how I was the only person shes ever truly loved. Shell call me daddy and fantasize about us having the cutest sleepovers. Worst yet, she told me awhile ago she still loves one of her other exs. The dude doesnt even care about her depression and just uses her for sex. She doesnt see that though. I cant do this anymore. Shes tearing me apart. I just want to kill myself to make this halfdecade nightmare come to an end.",
    "How to make a sweatshirt I spent weeks designing feel like mine again? So back when my ex and I were together. I made yet 2 custom matching sweatshirts. I spent weeks designing them. Countless hours all gone and wasted when she left me. I put it in a box and tucked it in the farthest corner of the house that I could along with other memories. How do I make it feel like mine again. How do I unlink it from her. I put so much time and effort to make it. But it pains me to look at it and it hurts even more to wear it. I tried wearing it the other day and immediately took it off. It gave me such a rush of memories. We both wore those sweatshirts together for a month straight. And just holding it makes me miss her. Idk what to do. I want to wear it again but theres so much behind it that it is so hard.",

I feel I do not want to talk to any of my friends or families anymore because Im hurting them by being depressed. They are supportive but a lot of them cried and my parents get depressed too because Im depressed. Therapy and medication has not been helpful. I might try intensive outpatient programs. I do not know what to do anymore. I text some crisis line sometimes but when they ask me about suicidal thoughts I always say no. Because Im afraid that they will disclose this to my school and when my school knows about this its very troublesome as I have experienced. Or they will call the police to come over.",
    "Don't understand my depression 28 year old male here. Im having a bit of trouble expressing what my depression really is. To my therapist, my psychiatrist, my longterm boyfriend, hell even to myself. I dont want to kill myself, I dont want to die, I just want to not be... me. My selfesteem and confidence is zero, but I put on a happy face. Unfortunately Im funny, so when I finally express how Im really feeling it always comes at a shock. I cant take pictures of myself, I can barely look in the mirror, because I hate what I see. I was required to submit a picture of myself for university and literally had a panic attack. I always give seeminglyaccurate reasons about not posting anything on social media, and I finally came clean to my boyfriend that every reason I dont is because I cant stand myself, and to be honest, I dont think he understood. Hes always been supportive of me and helping me get the help I need, but I dont think he is able to empathize rather than sympathize. I have this selfdisgust and selfhatred. I dont want to see myself in pain or hurt myself, I just dont want to see myself. Im conflicted because one side of my brain I am able to logic my way out of some spiraling thoughts... thanks CBT therapy but the other is just so dark and unforgiving and unrelenting. I thought my meds were working, and I think they are. I think they finally allowed me to see this a bit clearer, but Ive really struggling since. The thing is  I want to get better. I want to be okay, and I just dont know how. Anyone have any direction or thinks to think about?",

Im not being able to go, and have missed some classesthink Ill do today too because at the moment I wake up I get a horrible, sharp, piercing feeling of depression and I just want to stay in bed. I take 50mg of sertraline at 1000 and another 50mg at 1700. At night, at around 1800, I take 25mg of amitriptyline, and just before getting to bed I take 2mg of clonazepam.

    "Forcing yourself to do things you normally love during depression Im in the midst of a 5 week bout with depression, which for me has nothing to do with sadness. Rather, depression for me is a horrifying head fog that disconnects me from all emotions, interests and appetites. All I can feel is the fear and anxiety of being in this state of mind. If you suffer from this flavor of depression, or any flavor, do you force yourself to do the things your normally love even though you cant connect with that feeling of enjoyment? For me, doing this and not getting the reward makes it all worse, but I also dont wanna wait around to feel better to do these things, If that makes any sense. What do you do in this situation?

I am an engineer developer, my family is middle class my father is a pediatrician and my mother is a fisiotherapyst, I also have a sister 4 years my junior and we live in a third world country Bolivia so we had enough but never had luxuries, my wife in the other hand had a worst time growing up, her father was a taxi driver and her mother is a school teacher assistant with two more brothers so they were basically poor with just enough to get by.

    "I dont love/like my mother and idk if the relationship is worth salvaging. Another thing she been on methadone for like 13 years, thats not how methadone should work but fuck it im no doctor. 4 years later she makes a big deal about money and all this stuff and i go to find out that, first she never used my money to pay rent, it turned out from me talking to our landlord that she owed almost 6 months of backrent! I also found out that the boyfriend didnt contribute to any of the finances so at a young age she put her financial responsibility in my hands. We ended up getting evicted and I was pissed and didnt talk to her for 2 years then she got cancer. So i did what i felt was the right thing and was there for her regardless. She got better and now well this whole thing came from a argument the other day we had. I have major depression and i was trying to ask for help and she got mad at me cause i told her i cant talk to her about it. She asked why and i told her the truth that i dont wanna have a who had a sadder life competition. Because she has a habit of if i was to complain about my childhood instead of listening or sympathizing she would bring up things like oh i was molested my childhood wasnt that great. Yeah thats fucking terrible and all that but that doesnt excuse your decision for you children. Youre supposed to work to make things better for them. Which is the only valuable life lesson she taught me, because she never did it. Now im in a ok place Im in school full time work 2 jobs all so i can have a easier life, and she dont understand that Im busy even though i told her this.

I 23F have tried to make a post to explain whats going on with me, but I just end up crying, and everything I write is incoherent, so. Sorry if theres not enough context? Im having a really difficult time right now. I cant really focus on work, and I dont get in as many hours as I should. I feel like I am letting people down. Existing is exhausting, and all I can do is waste time on my phone, because if Im on my phone I dont have to think and time passes more quickly. Im tired of spending hours on my phone instead of doing functionalpeople things, Im just putting everything off and setting myself up for failure. But doing anything productive feels too daunting, and I dont know how to start? I want to develop healthy habits  spend less time on my phone, maybe go outside more often, go on walks, stick to my work schedule, find hobbies. Simple things that I know would improve my mental health. But even though I want those things, I feel like Im not motivated enough to make a change. Its always easier to stay in my comfort zone, to distract myself. My brain says I need to change, but I feel like I dont want it bad enough to actually try. I cant keep living like this, though. Ive tried looking for advice online, but everything I see involves  Therapy, which I dont have money for. Reaching out, but I have very few people Im close with, and I dont feel comfortable talking about my mental health to any of them. Selfhelp books and stuff, which just...does not work on me. Hobbies, but I dont really have any of those anymore? Ive been depressed for so long, Ive lost interest in the ones I used to have as a kid, and never developed new ones.

    "To everyone who actually took time to read this, thank you for caring for me, a random stranger who probably doesn't deserve getting much help anyways. While I was using my iPad, my brother in law got all in my face and pointed out how I already used my iPad for 4 hours already, so he told my sister to block my iPad so I could stop using it. I got really stressed, and I couldnt vent because I could only text on my iPad and computer which was in the living room, and I didnt want to see their faces. So I resorted to using the back of a scissor blade, and ran it back and forth on my arm with all the scabs, and I scraped off the scabs  23 layers of skin. It wasnt bleeding much, so I just cleaned it and let it dry. Then when my mom called me to go on a family walk, I flat out refused, and I started yelling at her for never understanding me, and how fucked up I always felt, and how tired I was I had cried a few times earlier and I just wanted to never see their faces for the rest of the day. Then my mom saw my arm, and she just left the room. Then around 23 minutes later, I hear my sister freaking out about my mom having a bloody nose. A few moments later, my mom started spitting out blood, and thats when we decided to bring her to the ER. On the return trip from the ER, my sister just glares at me and says how the blood was triggered due to stress, and how we were lucky it was only some blood, since she couldve gotten a stroke. My mom starts trying to explain to me that it wasnt my fault, but she just starts tearing up in the middle of it. Of course, thats the last thing me and my sister want, so we just shut up and try to comfort her before something else happens. Then at home, after I had taken a shower and was trying not to cry as I explained the whole situation to my best friends, my mom just comes out of the room with Vaseline and sash in hand. She starts binding my arm, even though I was the one who caused her to be so sick, and she acted like nothing happened and tried to comfort me as I started shaking.",

Its like I just think I might as well destroy myself, because I simply can. I know its bad to hurt me and if people see scars Ill be in even more trouble. So why dont I care? Do I think I deserve this? How do I care? Im never going to get better if I do bad stuff like this when Im feeling low.",
    "My mom said I'm faking depression Hey everyone, Ive never posted here but I hope youre all well. I really need some advice if you have any. I go to one of the top universities in North America and am currently in my 5th year. These past 2 years have had me feeling really low and Ive been thinking about seeing a therapist because I may have depression. I feel very demotivated and tired even though my work load is insane and I cant afford to slack. Often times I feel very worthless, a burden, and a waste of space. I also binge eat which makes those feelings worse. The eating has gotten a LOT better but it still had its moments. Anyway, Ive been wanting to sew a therapist but I need insurance which had been kind of holding me back. My dads insurance covers the whole family I live at home, for cultural reasons but he and my mom would be able to see who uses it. After a year, the feelings got worse and I made the decision, after much deliberation, to tell my mom that I would like to see a therapist and that I would like to use the insurance. She said okay and j started looking but most were fully booked or not taking new patients. Today, we were discussing my sisters divorce. Her ex had depression and was one of the reasons they got a divorce. My mom says that anyone who has depression shouldnt get married, and that it applies to me. She said that she thinks Im faking it for attention because its not visible to her. She said if I do think I have it, I should forget about finding love or getting married. I interpreted her words to mean that people it depression are unworthy of love and that I would ruin someones life like my sisters ex ruined hers. I dont know, the feelings are kind of intense right now and I dont want to cry but theres a lump in my throat and I just want to sleep but I have a huge midterm tomorrow and I have to see her later and my sister is of no help Sorry for the rant",
    "I feel like shit after I stopped taking pills I love in abusive family and Im traumatized because of it. I cant focus in school, cant ready, every contact with humans makes me anxious and drains me out of energy despite that I used to be social butterfly when younger. I was on Zoloft for 6 months and it didnt really help me until I started taking 75mg doses. Then I stopped taking it because of my parents pressure. Taking meds for mental problems isnt normal form them. Eventually I had enough of their trash talk and gave it up. I regret it since then my symptoms are getting worse and worse. I got more suicidal, my emotions are vague and I feel exhausted all the time. It drives me crazy. I think my mother canceled meeting with psychiatrist and I dont want to dose meds by myself. I did one stupid thing and thats enough. What do I do, what should I tell them?",
    "i think i have depression but i can’t seek medical help — need guidance Im not clinically diagnosed, and cant get a proper diagnosis or medication. Im under my parents insurance plan and there is a stigma within my family and culture about mental health. I struggle with body image issues that got a lot worst since the pandemic. I cant ever focus with my school work any more. I have no motivation to do any of my work but I still do it, its hard waking up. Im constantly in bed when I should be working out or doing my school work. I feel numb pretty much everyday. I dont have suicidal thoughts but I just dont have the motivation to live or to do anything that would help my life. What can I do? I cant constantly feel like this, and I cant get behind in school, I need advicehelp.",
    "Self-Improvement help After 2.5 years of living with my girlfriend she left. I dont want to get much into detail but up until some months ago relationship was great, then we started having some minor issues, which bummed me out a little. I never told her about it its no big deal, I cant justify being mad about this little thing... I thought. Of course you can figure that these minor issues only began to grew, pushed us apart and ultimately killed the relationship. When we recently talked about this it was already too late, but upon openly talking about the matter I understood her behaviour much better. Probably, if we had talked about that way sooner we could have saved the relationship. The problem is, it is not the first time I do that. I have had previous relationships die for the same reasons. So here I am once again, depressed because my fear of confrontation killed what was the best relationship, by far, that I have ever had. She was such a great girl and I fucked up everything. I also believe that it was not only lack of communication  confrontation fear. When things were going bad the thought of breaking up was constantly in my head. Again, I never told her about it nor decided to take the step myself. This is probably because I dont have many friends and fear solitude. There are a lot of times already when I feel lonely, especially during the latter months, and I didnt want to make matters worse. However, I am almost sure that having this constant break up thought made me unconsciously sabotage the relationship and be more distant. Of course, talking about this stuff earlier on would have probably helped. I am fed up with this, I know that keeping things to myself and other similar behaviours of mine are only going to keep destroying relationships, but its like I cant help it. As I said this is not the first time this happens to me and would probably not be the last one if I dont force myself to change.",
    "Should I go to high school reunion if I had a terrible past? Basically, in my high school life I went thru social anxiety, depression, lots of negative emotions so I didnt even create strong connections with these people. They are now inviting me over, but the thought of going there... eeek! Its awkward and theyre all going to be connecting or recounting their memories or whatever...meanwhile I had a shitty past. So, its not like I can go there and act all fairy dairy. Idk. Initially I actually contacted a friend but now Im hesitant because the circle is getting larger and theyre inviting a teacherlol.. I cant pretend to be happy when I just had a terrible experience. So... I dont know what to do. Lol! I even imagined sharing them my experience in the future, and hopefully they would understand and I could perhaps recreate a friendship? Lol. But when its people from your past ... you cant help but associate them with the past. If anyone has read this and can relate, please help out a sistabrother.",
    "Can we trust depressed people? I mean, a depressed person who is struggling with their feelings and thoughts. Sometimes they are themselves but sometimes they are not when they let the depression take over. So should we trust or how much should we trust things that a depressed person talked about their feelings? Will they change their mindfeelings from time to time? For example, today your depressed friend says that she hates you, but the next day she would be regretted about it. Actually she needs you but said that because she was angry with someone else.",
    "Nightmares are making my life a living hell Ive been having dreams that feel like they last multiple days, despite me being asleep for only a few hours at a time. Its extremely disorienting to wake up from these. Sometimes its relatively normal stuff happening in the dream, but others its not. Its rare for me to sleep without having a dream that feels like at least two days pass, even if it was just a short nap in real time. The worst of these, which has repeated itself several times, involves me being trapped in a makeshift prison camp and used as a slave for manual labor. This particular dream spanned a little more than two weeks the first time I experienced it. I remember some of my fellow prisoners and trying to make friends with them, before being beaten and told not to speak to anyone. About I week in, I often start planning an escape attempt. Its worked twice, but when it fails, the prison guards kill me, and anyone else who tried to escape with me. On the two occasions where I did escape I was the only one to do so. I run home, to find the furniture rearranged and the walls in different places. I beg my roommate for help and hes confused, saying Ive been gone less than an hour. Im pursued by the prison guards, who for whatever reason are Russian and are experts at tracking people down without raising suspicion. Ive resorted to killing one of them in one of these dreams, and then it turned out he was just a normal person and not actually there to kidnap me. The normal police then arrested me and I went through an interrogation where the police concluded I was insane, then dropped me in an asylum. It legitimately feels like Im experiencing multiple days or weeks of time in these dreams. I dont know whats going on. My own mind is holding me hostage. Ive been dealing with depression for about three years now, and its gradually gotten worse over time, but the dreams are a relatively new addition to my daily torments and I dont know how to deal with them.",
    "I feel down for no reason at times, even while being with friends Sometimes Ill be doing good and having fun with friends and then I just start feeling sad. Theyll usually ask if Im good and stuff and I say things like yeah Im fine. I dont really believe myself, and I know they dont either at times. They tell me they are there to talk if I need, but since I feel depressed for no reason I dont know what I would say to them. I want to talk about it but all I know is that I randomly feel depressed for no reason, theres no big event or smaller event its just random. What are some things I could talk about? They want to help me and Id like to receive it, but what am I supposed to do? Just tell them I feel depressed for no reason at times?",
    "Any hard won good mood disappears at the minorest inconvenience I have moderate to severe depression. Sometimes Im able to get excited about things though and thats great. But even when Im in a good mood, every time something mildly inconvenient happens I get really upset and have a hard time pulling myself out of it. Like I went to the zoo one of my favorite places today and found out theres a small surcharge to reprint my lost membership card and it just crushed me and now Im not excited to be here any more. Or a few weeks ago I went to a store and they didnt have one thing I wanted because of supply chain issues and I was grumpy for like an hour. It sounds stupid and immature but I dont know how to stop it. Its seriously impacting my quality of life.",
    "I know what I have to do but I don’t want to do it I know I should exercise, get up early and eat better but I just dont feel like it. For about 2 weeks I was up, feeling competent getting shit done and trying To ingrain the feeling in myself of how much better it felt. I know it and I just cant bring myself to do things again. Im so frustrated because I want immediate results from exercising, Im tired of not being fit but I cant stand how theres no results for a long long time. Ugh!!!! !",
    "I feel lonely even though there's no need to But I dont see how it is hard work to think about my friends at least once in some weeks. Maybe stuff like that is way more important to me than to others. I know that I love myself and who I am and thats why its even harder for me to understand this. Am I doing something wrong? Are my expectations too high even though, in my opinion, theyre pretty much as low as they could possibly get? Am I just knowing the wrong people? This is not something that gets me down on a regular base. Its more like a phase that lasts for a couple of hours and then Im fine again. But lately this has occured more often and for longer periods of time. And obviously this affects my daily life as well because once Im depressed I mostly just sit there and dont know what to do with my time. Everything suddenly seems boring. Even though one simple message for example, its not like this is the only thing that causes me to get depressed would potentially fix it. Sorry for this essay. Im not a native speaker so there could be some mistakes. But I do hope that at least someone takes the time to read through it and give me an honest opinion what I should do. How do you think I can convice them to think about me more often? It honestly seems like begging to me and I would rather avoid that. I just want the heartache to stop...",
    "Help feeling things I feel nothing except tired and numb all the time. True happiness is something I havent felt in a long time. Im trying harder and harder every day to at least look happy but its physically draining. Im so exhausted by my days off that I cant do anything except sleep. I originally thought that I was feeling this way because I wasnt happy with how things were in my life. So, I started working at those things hoping that eventually I would feel happy again, but its not working. Something has changed inside of me. I cant pinpoint a time or anything significant that would cause me to feel this way, but its here now and Im struggling to stop it. I want to stop the nothingness. Its unfair to my husband and especially my kids to have to live with someone who cant find joy in even the little things. I dont want to kill myself or stop existing, I just want to feel things again. So if anyone has any advice other than medication, therapy, and yoga exercise Im all ears. What have you tried that works? And how long did it take?",
    "I don't wanna feel like this anymore and I'm too broke to be depressed. This is my first time telling anyone about this so excuse me as Im rambling. And please dont say anything like Thank you for saying this and taking a big step. That really makes me feel worse about myself. Honestly Im getting really sick of feeling sad and angry all the time and when Im sad I couldnt stop crying and I couldnt control my tears which is pretty bad in Singapore where Im living where general people will isolate you when you show any signs of mental health issues. And I couldnt make any friends here because of my nationality and all the prejudice I get just by being myself has been repeating itself in my mind every day. Not only that but also workplace bullying has led me to be even closed off and led me to not be able to leave the house because I felt as soon as I step out of house people will judge and isolate me which make me feels like there is no point of going out anymore. I know iTzzZ NooO BiGG DeALzzZ, all the teenage girls hv this once in their lives. From the two psychiatrists Ive visited and Im 26F but I really wish I could move pass all these experiences and how it makes me feel all the time but I couldnt manage to find a therapist who I can trust and is empathetic. And I couldnt afford it regularly since Im couldnt force myself to work for the past 8 months. I hv tried getting help from public services here but the experiences was truly horrible and it has made my condition even worse. Ive been reading books hoping I could find an answer but that doesnt really work and it couldnt calm me down. I really need help to get out of this cause I dont wanna keep spiral into this again and again. Thanks in advance!",
    "Ex broke up with me because he was depressed and said he still has feelings for me He and i were together for 1.5 years. He had depression since the beginning because of his psycho parents. His dad said he hates him and told him to die because of high medical expenses. He said that he cannot be in a relationship because of his depression and said he probably will never fix himself because he is depressed to the point that he will never be fixed. Since the beginning of our relationship he said he was dealing with depression. He also said he will leave his parents house after the summer for college which made him upset. He wanted to leave as fast as possible. He told me that his dad abused him in front of his extended family and nobody saved him. This made him extremely depressed. He said rn is not the right time to be in a relationship and I completely understand why he is doing that. He said that he still has feelings for me and that he will never be happy with me if he doesnt love himself. I completely understand his stance and I gave him space. 1. Do you think he will come back? 2. Do you think his life will get better when he leaves his abusive family?",

I feel alone in the dedication and commitment I have to wanting to make a relationship work. I sabotage all my female friends because I have developed an aversion to women because in my brain I am convinced they will all try to have sex with my boyfriend. I will find something, anything, to validate my beliefs and it spirals out of control, I cant figure out whats real and whats not. I cant figure out when my brain has made something up it never feels made up! It always feels real. I feel, like whats the point of a relationship if it might just end one day. I cant imagine being alone. I dont want to be alone. I know its unhealthy. I understand this. I understand that I have a problem. But, its not going to just simply go away. Its not that I am not capable of making it go away. Im sure I could try. Its that I do not want to let go of my dreams. I dont want to live another way, but I feel alone.

    "First-time depression Hi guys, its my first time on reddit. Im getting kinda depressed right now, mostly because of my disappointments. I put all my hopes and efforts into a competition and now that I failed my expectation was expecting a second prize but got a consolation one. More ironically, my boyfriend got a first prize which was kinda unbelievable and unprecedented in my school for the past 10 years. To make matters worse, he is entering university next year. Helping him with his academic profiles and scholarship applications made me really proud of him but concurrently selfpitiful. I feel a little inferior to him and constantly downplay myself without knowing how to stop. Both events struck me profoundly and Im confused as to what to do.

    "I need some help When I was 13 years old suffered from bullying at school and I had depression for a long time, my parents knew about it because I put a lot of suicidal stuff on my facebook and I had a friend of my dad on my friends list, so she saw it, talked to me and after she called my parents. They helped me more my mom and they took me out of school. But my parents started to say that it was a shame, that everyone would find out about my depression and they wanted to take all of my social medias so no one will know Im sick. After that I was scared to talk about them about how I feel. When I was 16 I started to feel empty and scared, I was scare of the night, I was scare to go to sleep, I started to push all my friends away and I stopped liking the things I used to do. I didnt know what it was, so I told my parents I was feeling weird, but my dad just told me You are just growing up And I never talked to them about the topic again. Im 18 rn, 2 years hiding my depression and now is killing me, I cant hide it anymore and I really want to search for help, I want to tell them but Im scare that they just push me away. I didnt told them about my depression because I didnt wanted to bother them with my problems and I dont want that they treat me like a bad person. Btw, sorry for my grammar and I hope some one can help me, I dont know how to tell my parents about it.",
    "Mental Illnesses aren't real...? My friend told me that mental illness wasnt real. Ive been suffering from Depression and Anxiety Disorder for the past 4 years. What he said, hit me really hard. He said, in the past people never had such things, he said only the new generation is too weak, that they use mental illness as an excuse to get out of things. And right now, its really sending me on a downward spiral. I feel so miserable. I dont want to feel this way, but I do. And if it doesnt exist, then was all these years of medication and therapy for nothing? Has my life just been a huge excuse? Im so confused right now, someone please make some sense.",
    "Scared to call crisis services Im in the USA. I have no insurance and effectively no money like, none I have some family, but asking them is out of the question. Im pretty sure somethings pretty wrong, considering Ive been crying and panicking and bludgeoning myself and thinking about suicide for years now, but I dont have any resources to go to an actual doctor. Earlier tonight when I was more worked up I called the US national suicide prevention hotline. The guy I talked to gave me the number for mobile crisis services in my rural county. I explained my financialinsurance situation to him and he assured me that if I call them, a doctor with this service will come to my location and its free, no charge but even if its true, what then? I cant imagine theyre going to actually do anything except take me to a hospital, stick me there for a few days, maybe they give me some medication and then they release me and tell me to make a follow up appointment with a doctor somewhere I cant pay and probably cant physically get to no car, rural area, and I get a bill for the hospital stay. Which I categorically will not be able to pay. If thats what would happen, I truly am better off dead. TLDR I want help but I strongly suspect that if I ask for any, Im only going to get the opposite. Am I crazy or am I right?",
    "Do you ever feel guilty for not doing enough to treat your depression? How do you deal with it? I keep falling into this terrible spiral of thoughts like well, you would feel less depressed if only youd exercise, eat healthy and keep the house clean, but of course, living with depression means I rarely have the energy to do all or any of those things. And the more I kick myself, the more energy I lose, so I sit in bed, eat cookies and let messes pile up around me, which in turn makes me more depressed, and so on.... Im on medication and in therapy, both of which help, but I get so down on myself for not being able to form better habits. I know I need to start small and to go easy on myself, but even then its a struggle. At the moment Im more focused on how to deal with the guilt of not doing things, as opposed to strategies for accomplishing said things. I break through the cycle every so often more often now with meds and can be feeling good for a while....and then seemingly without reason, I fall back into the hole again. Tldnr how to feel less bad when depression takes away your ability to treat your depression?",
    "Help me, please. I have 0 friends in the literal sense. I have been living like this for more than 3 years I feel like I dont have any identity that I can show, I feel empty because I have a big fear of being judged for what I am. I want to start giving a fuck but I cant. I fear sharing my musical and literary tastes even to my parents and my brothers. My parents are constantly pressing me to create contacts that will help me in the future and I feel bad for not doing this because its like I am missing half of the university experience. I have reached the point where I prefer Mondays over Fridays and Saturdays because I dont have the pressure from anyone to hang out with someone, in fact I now dread Fridays and Saturdays. I feel that if I continue in this state I will get ill like as in an actual disease, I am the living proof that humans NEED social interactions and are a SOCIAL species, I am getting desperate, I want someone with whom I can share my musical tastes, my fascination for books, football soccer, history, to have deep conversations, someone who has my trust just as once my old friends had mine and I had theirs, someone to go on adventures AND TO LIVE LIFE. I am now so embarrassed of myself that I CANT LOOK AT MY DAD INTO HIS EYES, my dad is a very compassionate and good person, but I cant look at him to his eyes when we talk, I simply cant. I have problems showing affection even to my parents who I deeply love but I cant externalize that feeling and I dont want to be like this, I want to have the courage to say I love you directly from my mouth and to be able to feel it truly, I want to have the courage to hug someone without getting uncomfortable, to say nice things when I feel them, to stop being a pessimist piece of shit and finally be happy at least for one entire day. I perfectly know my my mom and dad and I know they think to themselves When will this guy bring a girl or organize a party? I know they think this and I am sorry I dont have the bravery to speak to them about my problems. My brothers are also very nice to me but they also have their shit together and I know they also ask to themselves Why is he like this?",

I am just wondering if there is anyone out there that is cheerful and happy on the outside but deep down you are just very sad and lonely yet .... you are not really lonely you have friends family a job you play sports your active and always busy. Even when people arent very dependable or maybe mean to you .... you always just want to help you want to make people happy and really its because deep down you are not happy. Just for a moment sometimes you really want someone to notice but they dont cause you are putting them first and making them happy but no matter how hard you and try and not matter how much you know you should put yourself first you dont......

    "Just need to rant a little bit Ive always been someone who bottles up my thoughts, problems and feelings. I know that its a shitty way of dealing with things but oh well... Its come back to bite me in the arse now. Im a senior so uni is coming up later this year. Im having so much trouble planning my future, choosing what to study etc. I was thinking of having a gap year, but my country is changing some stuff which will make it much harder for me to get in 2020, so I should apply this year instead. My finals are coming up really soon and Im so terrified of not doing well. And I dont know if Im just imagining things but it feels like things are falling apart with my best friends too. It feels like theyre ganging up together against me, to pick on me and freeze me out. Everytime I hang out with them I feel extra depressed, but at the same time I feel guilty for being a downer. No ones asked me how Im doing, but I also dont want to dump my problems onto anyone. It feels like my friends wouldnt care anyway. So much has changed, theyve changed so much since the first year. I feel like I cant trust them anymore. My boyfriend cheated on me a few months ago so our relationship ended, and I feel really lonely. I just want to cry and isolate myself from the world. I hate myself for being like this. God, I feel so helpless and lonely.",

    "All I want - is my death Good day, everyone. This is not my first post on reddit regarding my problem. Long story  short I had a girlfriend. We have been friends for 7 years. She was my best friend. We supported each other in everything and always helped each other. But, as often happens, I fell in love with her. And I ended up in the friend zone, of course. For the last 5 years I have been with her in the friend zone. Although at one point it became clear that I could get out of her if I was more persistent  she herself told me about it. But things went downhill this year. She found a boyfriend and spent all her free time with him. I, in turn, turned into a bunch of depression and occasional jealousy. And in the end, a month ago, she said that we both understand that this cannot continue. That we need to end our communication, and I will only feel better if she disappears from my life. Today I tried to write to her and make up, to offer her just friendship, communication on the network and nothing more, because I need her very much. But she refused me. And she did it with such contempt, with such hatred. She said that she did not need this communication, that over the past month she understood. that she hasnt needed it for a long time. So in the end, she doesnt even need me as a friend. I really thought that everything would work out, and we would be at least friends again. But I was wrong. She doesnt need me, in any form. Now it is difficult for me to think and do anything at all. I practically cannot go outside, because almost immediately I feel anxiety and, often, I start having panic attacks even if I just go out into the garden next to my house. Because I immediately start thinking that she is out there somewhere, with her new boyfriend. I cant read, watch movies, I cant play games, because my thoughts are occupied with something completely different. I need to write my dissertation, and I cannot concentrate, because my thoughts are not at all about studying.",

So Ive finally hit the point where I think I might need to get help professionally, in the form of seeing a psychiatrist or therapist or whatever. My issue is that Im paranoid of having any sort of mental health diagnosis on my medical record. What are the pros and cons of this? The first thing I can think of is the fact that I own a decent amount of guns Im not suicidal, theres no reason it would be unsafe for me to own them and Im worried they may take them please leave personal politics out of that issue. Other than that its mainly just being scared of whatever, if anything, Im diagnosed with following me around on my record. Any one offer any insight?

    "Discord is awful, and I'm crying. When I ask to join a server with all my old friends who disliked me, I get a blatant fuck no from probably all the moderators. Everyone there is my friend, and I just want to feel happy again when being with my old friends. I know I hurt my friends emotionally, but Ive changed and Im doing better. But... They just wont move on, and them not moving on lead me to doing bad things to myself cutting, hurting myself, contemplating suicide. My life doesnt feel the same anymore.

Yes, Ive gotten a few disabilities from trauma. Alexithymia, higher emotional sensitivity, voices in my head, anxiety. It sucks. I wish it would go away. I wish I had friends. Real ones I could hug and kiss. So I can be happy.

    "I ( 26 female ) have decided to take care of my severely depressed younger brother (20m ) by letting him move in with me last week and need some tips. Moreover, I dont want his depression to trigger me and I dont want his negativity  not shaming him he is just very depressed and sick and needs help but his depression makes him so negative about everything  to bring me down, I want to keep pushing for a better life for myself and my brother without the negativty bringing me down as I worked so hard to get to a somewhat surface level healthy mindset  I say this because I.myself can get easily triggered and spiral if things feel to overwhelming especially when it comes to my family  ... It worries me because everything he says is a cognitive distortion and in life, as we know, you become the people you hang out with the most.. 4 . I want him.to become more resilient, I am not expecting a cure but I want him to be processing in the right direction not the other way around. 5. I also respect that he has a serious disease that needs medical attention and specialized  tailored followups. I want to be a good example to him... one that is different from my parents.. He has become like them . Negative about everything on top of having severe psychomotor retardation and lack of appetite  hence why I am am getting him to the doctor tomorrow . 6. He has been on antidepressants before but it wasnt good. He had more appetite but still didnt leave his room. Meds are not unknown to him. I believe tomorrow the doctors help will give us the best choices for him. 7. He is aware he is sick and even agrees he needs meds, we.watched a 50 min video by Dr. Sapolsky yesterday regarding how depression affects the brain and he realized just how affective depression is to the hypocampus etc... My brother knows he has congirive distortions most of the time. How do I keep him motivated to stay on track and improve slowly slowly day by day ?",
    "Randomly breaking down I randomly break down and cry without warning. Previously, it didnt happen often and when it does, I was would be able to control it for a bit till I find myself hidden from peoples eye.

    "How should I do this 'homework' from a therapist Hello, I am struggling with some pieces of homework between sessions that the counsellor has given me. These are the tasks 1. Call my friends and tell them how I feel. 2. Ask 10 people to describe me in three words. Im struggling with both of these because  Im a 26yearold man. I was not brought up to have  much less talk about  feelings. Sure, trying to break that sounds great in theory but one of my friend group tried that a year or two ago and none of us knew what to say or do at all. We felt so awkward and just left it. Some of our friend group just said this guy had had a few bad days and was blowing it out of proportion not nasty but none of us know how to handle it. Family are out of the question sadly as they always become very angry with me for mentioning feelings  Telling friends I feel bad during a coronavirus pandemic is incredibly selfish weve all got problems  It would also be proving them right theyve been hassling me contsantly to come home even though itd be illegal to socialise with them in person anyway RN, so kinda pointless. Ive told them I feel better away from my parents for a bit longer, plus I can work on an essay Im writing for uni. I live in a student area and students dont seem to be panicbuying like other groups, so i just feel more comfortable here. Saying I feel bad despite feeling this way for 15 yearsish would just increase their feelings that I ought to move in with the parents. Im vehenmently against this  I know it sounds like Im being critical and just shitting on the counsellors ideas, but I dont think Im going to be able ot do these tasks  Im worried about disappointing the counsellor. Weve had two sessions and at the end of each he has asked me what I found most useful and because Im not really sure what to say I just say the first thing that comes to mind. We talked for 20 minutes about problems Ive had about my appearance and being bullied for being ugly for aroun 15 years now and he seemed to think by the end of the conversation that I was healed.",

Recently I thought I found my soulmate. She made me feel a feeling I never felt in my life. She gave me so much needed self confidence and I gave it to her as well. Life was on the up. Things were complicated with current relationships but we knew it was going to be tough and I was willing to give her the world and totally shake mine up for it. At some point something changed. Extreme feelings of happiness to guilt, settling, lack of confidence in the situation and shutting it out. Now I am left feeling not good enough. I knew in the back of my mind I wasnt going to be but was always told otherwise. It felt like the most amazing dream. It was shattered. I dont know why but now I am left feeling a shell of what was being built up. I feel used and betrayed. It has been extremely hard to open up about the situation. I am very private and so is she. I just feel completely devastated and being now totally cut off from even a friendship I feel like someone died and its all my fault. I opened my heart and mind and they are left in tatters.

Back then I just felt like I lost all my positive emotions for no reason all of suden and I told it to friends and family and everybody was like  Its normal, it happens , it will disappeared... I cannot feel almost anything, when someone close to me die, I cant cry , when something good happens ,I cant smile sometimes but very rare I can feel euphoria  . I had no motivation and hope for better future then, and now is same . I have little health problems for 5 years ,and I cant even force my self to go to doctor because Im affraid of diagnosis, and things are worse now. People think Im doing a little bit better then earlier because I passed my entrance examination for college one month agolast year all my friends did it, I decided to make a one year break  . But college dont change anything. I m still big pesimits and cant feel anything. Actually I can feel fear. I have very strong social anxiety. I have 5 very close friends , they are like brothers to me and Im relaxed when Im with them , but when I talk to girls , Im totally confused. They even cant understand what Im saying because I dont open my mouth enough and speak very quiet ... I never had a girlfriend... Lets go back to social anxiety. Its very hard to go to for example market because Im overthinking what if someone asks me something, ... I have very good relationship with mother, not good but no bad relationship with sister , and very bad relationship with father its almost hate . I also have very often mood changings and I also take decisions very hard because I dont know what I want , and even when I take a decision, I change it very quick . I like watching soccer and basketball but its hard to concentrate to watching because my mind flyes somewhere... I cant find purpose of life. People dont understand how its hard when someone says  JUST FORCE YOURSELF AND GO TO DOCTOR , JUST GO OUT MAKE NEW FRIENDS ,... Sorry for long message .",

    "Do I have depression or something else? Hi everyone, please dont bite my head off as Im pretty new to all this but Im trying to figure out if what Im feeling is depression or not. I recently realised that Ive not been feeling okay for quite a few years, I googled some stuff and depression came up. Now I dont really trust random stuff thats written online so I thought the best thing to do was to speak to some people with depression on here and see if my symptoms fit? no motivation to get out of bed, if my parents didnt force me to get up then Id probably stay there until the late afternoon. I always like Ive been a disappointment, that Im a failure and that Ill always be this way later in life  I find it very hard to focus on anything, my attention span is very low. I fidget and become aggiated pretty easily  I quite often find it hard to get to sleep, Ill end up staying awake until the early hours of the morning. I spend almost all day in my room. I feel empty, lonely and sometimes start crying over the past or present. sometimes I make myself cry on purpose when Im alone, I dont quite understand why I do that. I find it hard to motivate myself to do basic things such as washing or brushing my teeth. I do them for my own good but it takes effort and I sometimes neglect those tasks. I sometimes think about death. I find it hard to care about anything. Then if I make a mistake over something I do find the energy to care about, I beat myself up about it harshly.",
    "I need help finding coping mechanisms TW suicide For most of my life, id always been extremely suicidal. I wont go into detail about my life but it sucks and heavily contributed to me having depression and being suicidal since before I even became a teenager. A couple years ago, I had a failed suicide attempt and thanks to the help of some people I managed to actually develop a will to live and I finally got rid of the suicidal part, but Im still struggling with the depression part. When I was suicidal, it was really easy for me to handle mental breakdowns by just telling myself Its fine. Ill just kill myself, I dont have to worry about the future that much. If things get as bad as Im fearing theyre about to, I have an easy way out. Now, whenever I have mental breakdowns I default to saying the same thing but then I start thinking Fuck. I dont want to die, I cant just kill myself. Theres no way out of this. and my mental breakdown continues and gets worse. Im really struggling with handling mental breakdowns. Even when I try to distract myself, either I fail to be distracted and keep overthinking, or it just pushes the breakdown further down the line and the moment I stop being distracted I fall back into the breakdown. Im trying to stay away from substance abuse. It works, but I want to stay healthy and I have personal experience with the dangers of substance abuse. Ive tried depression medication before but none of them really helped me much. Im considering therapy, but Im too anxious that revealing I used to be suicidal might make them worry Im currently suicidal and result in a psych ward situation. I dont know what to do anymore to cope, google doesnt really help, its hard. A clarification just in case, Im seriously not suicidal. I will not be killing myself. I dont need people spamming the comments telling me why I should stay alive, I just need help finding coping mechanisms please.",
    "Therapist suggested medication - what to expect The inability to attract people is a massive personal failure and a surefire indication of my low worth.

    "What happens when I have tried all medications and still have no improvement? Around 8 years ago I was diagnosed with Anxiety Disorders. I didnt take it as seriously as I should have, because now I believe Ive added major long term depressive to the list. I have tried 23 of the ABCs of SSNDRIs, the missing third is above my price range. Im worried that I will exhaust all choices for medication, and more worried about what that means is next for me. Ive expressed to family members I would be willing to do electro shock therapy if they still do it Any input is welcomed, whether its a success story or just general help. Id like to know what choices I may have",
    "Has anyone else experienced anything like this? Ive been dealing with depression and anxiety for nearly five years now but recently been dealing some stuff I havent experienced before. Ive been having thoughts that I feel like i cant control  not all the time but a lot. When it happens i feel out of control and like I cant stop thinking. Normally those thoughts are desperate or self loathing and sometimes its suicidal not active. I feel like someone is injecting thoughts into me and that Im just kinda there as those thoughts are happening unable to stop it. Ive also been having weird dazes where I feel like Im just doing everything on autopilot. I dont really know how to describe it honestly except sometimes I feel like Im thinking nothing at all, or sometimes it goes hand in hand with those racing thoughts. A couple of times when this happened at college I would be walking around campus but didnt feel like I was really there. I dont know whats going on but I feel very out of control and im worried.

And with these other friends, I have plans in the future to go on a road trip across the country with. Its weird knowing that I know have other close friends, who my best friends dont even know. And it was weird coming back home, seeing my friends, and knowing that I dont even want to be here. I want to be back with my youth volunteer group. My friends were really happy I was back, but I cant possibly feel the same way under these circumstances. Im NOT happy to be back. I dont WANT to be here. My life is so depressing now. Almost every moment since Ive been back, Ive felt like Ive suffered. Sometimes, for brief moments, something has made me feel happy. And Ive felt content for that moment. But then I remember my current situation, and it feels like a pang to my stomach. I feel like I cant escape this world of misery. I know that COVID19 will blow over, Ill have a good summer with my friends here. And next year, Ill go on a road trip with my good friends from the programme. But right now I just feel empty. What am I gonna do for the next few months? I wasnt even supposed to be here.",
    "I hit an all time low today I made plans to end it all today. I was so sad. Then my mom came home and asked me if I wanted dinner. I rejected and then went in the kitchen and ate it anyways. She was on the sofa so I kinda just rested my head against her side and drank some green tea. It helped calm me down. Before she came home, I was on my bed all day. And I kept getting good sleep even without doing anything. Im realizing im mentally tired. I realized I dont need to kill myself because I am already dead. Her being home made me feel neutral rather than sad so it felt like a huge shift. I feel like I need to go on depression meds.",
    "Someone else in my skin would be happy, I've no right to be depressed and sinking into alcoholism, yet here I am Life has been very kind to me, and my stupid ass cant take advantage of it. Someone with a better personality or someone more capable would have a very happy life in my skin. I think of killing myself every day. I wont do it. But the thought, thats not normal right? This turned into a rant and I apologize for that.",
    "Just found out the girl I’ve speaking to the last 7 years is talking to someone else. Need some advice please. Ive been through hell and back with her, and I value her friendship so much that I can get through all the suffering and pain I have when shes around just so I can spend some time with her, but all she does when she comes over is sit on her phone for hours and just smiles at it. Im an absolulte mess right now. I have a heart condition and the last couple hours I felt like I was having a heart attack from my anxiety attack but thats only because Ive had a couple hours to take in the news. What do I do? We havent spoken in 2 weeks. I actually tried to call her today to see how she was cause we havent spoken and I did not receive a reply. Do I bring it up to her? I know shes just gonna lie to me and tell me she isnt talking to anyone. Do I just delete her out of my life? Im so lost and confused. Its a 14 year friendship and my only true friend and I dont want to lose it, but I dont think I can ever look at her the same or talk to her for at least a long time because she knew that me finding out would hurt me. I even told her Id rather hear it from her rather than anyone else because itll hurt less, and she always says to me if I ever found out she was talking g to someone she knows I would kill myself. Id love to get some advice on what to do, because I dont have anybody to talk to about my problems other than her, but unfortunately this is about her. I understand that none of this is her fault because you cant control your feelings. But Im upset at the fact that she hid this from me, and apparently saw him and made out with him before she came over to my house for my birthday a few weeks ago. TLDR in love with my best friend. She doesnt have feelings for me. She hid the fact shes been speaking to a guy which really hurt me cause I told her if she ever was to tell me because it would hurt less. She knows about my feelings and I know she doesnt have feelings for me.",

    "I'm seriously considering suicide again. I wont label my social issues, as I havent got a clinical diagnosis like anyhting else on this list, but I think it fits more into the antisocial category than asocial or social anxiety, because of my negative and possibly misanthropist views. I have 2 past suicide attempts, once by asphyxiation, and the other by insulin overdose. Now, Im just wasting away, induging myself and slowly poisoning myself. My only friends 3 or 4, whom Ive always valued highly, are distancing away from me slowly, after nearly 6 years of friendship to be honest, I dont blame them, because Im fucking weird to hang around. But it does hurt quite a bit. I have a cousin 3 months younger than me, who has a much better and more successful life than me. His father my moms younger brother by 1 year is the current president 33rd of the KoreanAmerican Association of Chicago and a Northfield Township trustee. My cousin has a better social life, better health he is ripped as one would describe, and taller than me, while I am barely keeping my muscle mass together. Im 56kg, 170cm, has better looks than me, is a better student no problems in school and is just allaround a better person than me. People follow him around, and as much as it hurts my pride to admit this, I am envious that girls just follow him around. My family isnt very supportive neither. My aunt and uncle cares for me I hope but treats me as if I were some lazyass scum, because their son is objectively better than me, even though I am doing my fucking best, trying not to die from a DKA every day. I lost 56 pounds in 2 weeks, all muscle mass, because I dont have much body fat. I excercise semiregularly 45 mins a day, 34 hours a wekk, maybe, I study, I do what everyone else does, and I even put more time into it all possible because I assist school once a month now, all assignemnts are submitted through a school intranet. My grandparents the ones alive clearly cares more for my cousins than me, and they dont necessarily hide that.",
    "I’m so scared. I dont know what to do. It feels like I might have a panic attack right now, Im just trying to stay calm. I dont really know what to write, or what to say. I just need to do something to distract myself. My parents think Im doing great with staying home and stuff, but to be honest Im really stressed. I havent done much schoolwork because it makes me even more stressed. Ive been sewing a lot because I dont know what else to do. I think of all the people scared right now, and it makes me more scared myself. I dont want to talk to anybody, because I dont know what to say. I feel like I want to cry, but I just cant. Physically, no tears will come out. Im sorry, I just needed to write something. Thank you if you read this. Im just in a not very good place right now, health wise. Its just really hard",
    "I can’t help myself, and there is nowhere to get help. I dont know if I can say that I tried to fix whats wrong with me. I attempted to get better and fix myself, and every time I tried I failed. I tried understanding why I failed, and I failed at that too. I also have gender dysphoria. It isnt bad most of the time, I dont know if I should try to do something about it, but it hurts me. I came out to my mum and she acted like I killed her son, so I got back into the closet. So I have no idea what to do. I have a friend, but she is not really in a great place to help me, and since my friend is not my therapist, she cant help me in a way a therapist might be able to help me. I tried just ignoring my dysphoria and I guess it works to some extent but its not really insignificant. But its also not significant enough for me to make up my mind about fixing it. Also my parents are not mentally very stable so if I came out it could financially hurt my sister. Because my dad is the only provider and his mental state is hanging by a thread. I tried thinking hard about stuff, and I failed. I tried doing stuff but I failed. Lets say that I failed to try hard enough maybe. I cant help myself. I have no hope from the future, everything is going to get worse. I am also sick, some kind of bone marrow disease. One day it may kill me. Doctors arent really sure if I have it but they basically treat me like I have it, so it is likely that I have it. And I have started to notice that I dont really want to get better. I dont know what a normal day feels like anymore. I dread the future. I also noticed that I have an obsession with pain.",
    "Low functioning depression Hi reddit. The title of this post is quite ironical as Ive spent the last 10 minutes making a new account just so I could post this anonymously, have had to get out of bed for it and have finally dedicated myself to doing at least something today. Nonetheless, I see this situation as a minor bright spot in my current life and desperately need advice regardless. I am a senior highschooler from a lowincome family in Europe. Ever since I was 13 or 14 years old Ive been struggling with some kind of selfdiagnosed I never went to therapy for many reasons depression andor anxiety. The causes of such problems have changed throughout the years, but they were mostly linked with social anxiety, unhealthy amount of selfimposed academic stress and god knows what else. My first two years of high school were marked by drenching amounts of anxiety regarding new acquaintances, extremely low self esteem, low functioning due to stress and frequent suicidal thoughts and wishes. Over time, my social anxiety went away, with it most of my problems, and for the last year I havent felt as close as bad as I did before. I thought my depression finally disappeared, and that Ive changed as a person. Now, I know I was wrong. At the moment I am experiencing a great deal of stress caused by university planning. Like previously mentioned, I live in a lowdeveloped European country in a lowmiddle class family. My biggest chance to do something with my life is to go to university abroad, as universities in my country are pretty much shit. Ive dedicated all of my elementary and high school education to university planning, constantly striving for good grades, many extracurriculars and additional tests. And now, when the time has finally come to apply for universities and write my damn personal essays and send them, I blocked. I cannot make myself to sit and write the essays, as I am a huge perfectionist and am probably scared to start writing as I fear they wont end up good. The more time passes, the more stressed I am, the harder it is to focus, and it all ends up being a great, vicious circle.",
    "Two Depressed people in a relationship Im really struggling and need some support right now. Ive been with my boyfriend for a few months, and we clicked immediately. Weve always been really forthcoming with our struggles with mental illness. I tend to lean more into anxiety with sporadic bouts of depression. He, on the other hand, is a full blown clinically depressed. The depression started creeping up beginning of September. At first it was subtle, and I was doing ok with dealing and understanding. But now, its manifested into full blown anxiety attacks on my end. I cant even joke around and be fun anymore, because I consider every thing he says to be to be a slight against me. Im misfiring and crying uncontrollably. And Im constantly battling between my intellect and what I know hes depressed, its not a choice, he doesnt mean to pull away or hurt my feelings when hes withdrawn, etc. and my anxiety monologue something is wrong, because I am wrong, and hes not telling me because he wants me to break up with himhurt me. The major difference between us is, I have a support system. I have group therapy, one on one therapy, and tools that I use to keep me in check. But lately, I can feel my codependency on him being happy completely fuck with my own well being. He says this is just how he is, and has been luke warm to my suggestions to see a therapist though I know he believes in counseling and has gone in the past. And its also screwed with our intimate side which I think is a lot of the source of ire. Sex is important, but my partners well being is of course more important. I am usually the one initiating, but the last few weeks hes been so down, we cant connect on that level. I have my own issues with self worth and feeling desired. A previous ex of mine withheld sex as a means to get us to break up, so I am on high alert. Its really hard to hear he loves me and this has nothing to do with me, but to feel the actions he makes are contradictory. I am really struggling to allow him this space to process and move through his depression without imploding on my end.",
    "I don’t feel like I’m enough and I need help Since the age of like 11 I would often get waves of depression and anxiety suddenly. Im mostly fine for a majority of the time and after each wave I try to pick myself up and go on like nothing happened, but anything either I or anyone else does could get me back down the same rabbit hole of wanting to die. My current theory is it stems from stress related issues caused by a dysfunctional household earlier in my life because of my parents divorce. It was rather messy, mostly because of my father. With these waves of depression I often find myself getting very paranoid that people are speaking about me behind my back and that everyone hates me. I also start to believe that Im absolutely worthless and a pile of living garbage. I get really distant from my friends and family and my immediate reaction is to block them on all social medias and not talk or look at them. Lastly, while these waves happen with no pattern that I could sense I always seem to carry this guilt and shame of my past which leads to my almost always sad behavior. If anyone has any advice please help, Im so tired and I have no hope.",
    "Feel as if I'm toxic because of my depression and anxiety, but I dont want to be As the title says, I feel as if Im toxic to those Im close to. When I ask they swear Im not, but part of me feels as if theyre saying that to be nice and not to hurt me. They let me ranttalk to them about things I deal with and how I feel, but I feel as if Im making them feel bad also and becoming more of a burden than a friend. I feel as if Ive ruined what couldve ruined any future with 2 different people because of it. I believe I understand and know the source of my depression and anxiety, and partly has to do with my familys religious beliefs. Yes Im a Christian, but my beliefs are different froms theirs and if they knew, it would be a huge mess and them possibly kicking me out. My parents currently help pay for my college, but Im hoping in the next year or so I can get a parttime job or internship to make enough to move out. Anyways, the only access to help I have is counseling at school. I want to be better and be happy and normall, but I dont know how and my parents beliefs mostly their church restrict me from doing so. I feel as if Im stuck and in a constant loop of finally being happy, something happening or realize what Im wanting to so is against what they believe, my anxiety getting bad, and then depressed. I have a close friend that tries to help me, but I feel as if he doesnt think Im trying to get better. He understands the situation Im in, but I still cant help but think that. I also got diagnosed with endometriosis which then restricts a lot of physical things I can do, which makes things worse mentally for me. Ive been asked by another friend if I have a hobby or something to keep me distracted, but I dont. I never did much activity growing up due to religious beliefs like sports or anything else. Even when I did find something I liked to do, I was told I couldnt anymore and had to give it up. I just feel as if Im stuck and I just dont know what to do anymore.",

    "What can I do at home if I'm trying to cut back on phone/internet usage? [Serious] I am a single mom to an 11 year old boy with severe ADHD and Dyregulatory Mood Disruptive Disorder. Weve lived alone for a year after living with my sister and brotherinlaw since my kid was 1. Ive gone from awesome to great to tired to bad to worse. My house is a disaster, my son walks all over me and is disrespectful, but he has a point I either sit at my desk or lay in bed. In fact, Ive gained a shit ton of weight this past year bc of the stress and depression. Physical activity is difficult, not to mention the lack of motivation.

    "Should I commit myself to a mental hospital? TW mention of selfharm suicide My depression has gotten really bad the past few weeks. Suicidal and selfharm thoughts are happening more often, and in general I just feel very gloomy and hopeless and anxious and awful. Im going through some pretty huge life changes right now as well, so I am really overwhelmed. I can feel myself slipping into a depressive episode, which hasnt happened in over a year. I am really scared of myself and scared of what might happen if I do not get help soon. I dont think I will act on my thoughts but still, I thought the same thing a year ago and I was wrong. Not asking for pity I just dont trust myself to keep me safe, yk? A month ago I scheduled an appointment with my therapist, but her next available appointment is in another month, and I honesty dont know what will happen if I wait that long to get professional help. Im not saying Im going to kms but Im just scared for my wellbeing. I think staying at a mental hospital would really help me because I just want a break from all of the stressors in my life and I dont want to lay in my bed all day, which is unavoidable at this point. I just want a break from my life and the ability to get out of this mindset or at least prevent it from getting worse. At a hospital, there would be people to help me get better and keep me busy, so I think a mental hospital is the best option. I dont know what else to do, but I really feel like Im a bomb waiting to blow up. What do you think I should do? Im just indecisive and bad at trusting my own judgement. Thanks",

Most would turn to their friends but I have none. Some would turn to their family, but my family has only anger. Ive been horribly depressed most of my life, trying to kill myself at 8 years old. I have tried not giving a fuck and its just never worked. I have no outlet for this feeling. No part of it is acceptable. I constantly say to control myself, but I hate myself so much. I dont know how to heal or to accept this path that she assures me Ive chosen. I just want to keep my family together. I love this woman more than I have ever loved anything in my whole life, but she doesnt see it. I love my kids and their probably the only thing thats keeping me alive at this point.

    "What do I say to him? What do I say to him? My 26F brother 23M attempted yesterday. Thankfully he was not successful. He called to say goodbye and tell me the he loved me. He did the same to some friends and left a note for my parents. This was a very serious attempt. He has had a lot of exceptional stressors lately in addition to the fact that he has been suffering from depression since 2018. He drove a car at 90mph into a telephone pole. Thankfully, he is getting help now and will be getting voluntary inpatient treatment until further necessary. Im going to see him on Monday. What do I say? What do I do? I dont want to make it all about me when I see him. Im angry, scared, and very sad about this. Im planning to get therapy for myself to cope with the anger, trust issues, and overwhelming sadness that comes with this event.

    "Struggling bad right now Ive 18m been struggling on and off with my depression for around 3 years now. I started smoking weed to deal with school and now college stress but that in itself has done more wrong than good as now im not only dependent but now I constantly have to lie to my mum about what Im doing which just makes me feel even more worthless and a failure of a son, not to mention the astronomical money I spend on drugs in general. I am failing college, my last chance to get a good education, meanwhile all my friends who have since moved across the country for Uni havent really kept in contact. The only people I see outside of work are the people who Im smoking weed with other than that I feel totally isolated. Every day I think of my death, how people would react and how Id do it. these thoughts went from being in the context of comfort while in a stressful situation to what feels like an inevitability  in other words I dont think like if I was to kill myself... instead I think When I kill myself.... on top of all this Im generally a clumsy person but also extremly self critical, whenever I make a dumb mistake it takes a toll on my mental state, every time I trip, stutter or whatever I feel totally worthless. I hate my music because it reminds me of hanging out with my friends who arent around anymore. There are more things but I dont want to ramble on. ampx200B No one knows this is how I truly feel, not even those closest to me. When I first started going through this I drunkenly told my friend a few tidbits but he didnt keep his word on not telling people so I decided to bottle everything up and pray that eventually my life would improve but since then its been a sharp decline. The reason Im writing this is because I feel someone needs to know even if its some guy 6500 miles away who knows nothing about me because I feel like if I told any of my friends it would change the way they see me plus I cant guarantee that whoever I told would keep it to themselves.",
    "Nothing is right in my life. I don't know if I can be fixed. I was both abused and neglected starting at about 5 years old. Prior to that I was raised very well, then my parents just took their anger out on me physically and verbally for years until eventually they just told me they gave up on me. I hated myself so much in highschool and would never let girls get close to me and even developed a violent hatred towards them. I became a drug addict, using opiates mixed with other drugs nearly every day to numb how I felt. No one ever caught me and I had to quit on my own. I dont think my brain ever recovered from this either. In the past 2 years Ive stopped enjoying all hobbies. I barely will myself to practice guitar a couple times a week. I cant play video games at all and have maybe put 24 hours into them the last 2 years. I go running everyday because of the endorphins rush but its so incredibly boring and then I remember I have to come back to reality and go to work and be put down by everyone around me. None of the goals I set a year ago excite me. In fact, I live in fear of accomplishing them because I just cant see myself enjoying them. But I changed my mind about what I wanted to do every year before that and I cant afford the time or money I will waste if I change my path yet again. And there is nothing I want to change it to anyways. I have to stick with something for once and the disinterest is killing me. I have physically insecurities that shouldnt bother me but do because Im already in such a fragile mental state. Ive never had a semblance of a relationship or been involved with anyone sexually and the loneliness doesnt help but reinforce my negative image of myself. I have bad genetics and pretty undesirable physical features, so even when Im in good shape Im not much to look at. I used to take pride in my intelligence but I dont have that anymore. My brain has been fried, neglected, and has deteriorated to the point where I may be able to understand complex ideas, but Im slower to process than your average remedial student.",
    "Everything fell apart after a failed business and a failed psyche. Figuring out next steps. Got back on adhd med in 2019, went and got a low paying but close IT job in September. Continued the Zoloft taper, and was okay until I began reaching the lower doses and as the winter kicked in the depression and suicidal ideation began to really kick my ass again. The job isnt in the field I want, Im spending most of the pay paying off credit cards I was using for the business. Now Im 6 months in to the low paying IT job, with 6 figures worth of student debt to pay off, stuck at home with no savings parents have no savings and are financially irresponsible... I blame myself but partly blame them for letting me take out so much to go to school when I couldve gone to a great local state school with my grades.. Im near NYC so thats where Ive been applying to a bunch of jobs but with basically no luck, apparently my degrees are worthless. Im still in a very anxious state and dont think Ill continue my Zoloft taper for a while, honestly Im about as anxious as I was back during the klonopin withdrawal. I could reach out to alumni from my school but I hesitate based on my current state of affairs. The depression plagues me a bit more lately, and I cant tell but I think the IT job may even be adding to my depression. Its relatively easy and keeps me out of the house and around guys my age which is nice. I think the years of being on Klonopin and Zoloft are really taking a toll on my mind as I try to get off. I cant think original thoughts, its just the same thing every single day, like a nightmare groundhog day. I appreciate anyone who took time to read through this post, really struggling to figure out my next steps, feel like Ive been stuck in the same headspace of suffering for a year and a half now. I keep telling myself the same story and it doesnt get me anywhere. Thing is this story seems to be the only thought stuck on replay every day. Just how different things couldve been.

    "I need help Im going to open up and be honest just because Im at a breaking point. This is a breakup story that has been like non before. I M27 was dating a beautiful girl F24 on and off for three years. We met in college where we dated for a year before we separated the first time. In that first year she had to have surgery to remove a bone spur on her foot and put on some weight. Personally that doesnt bother me. Ive never cared for my ladies weight, Im more into the personality, but it mattered to her as I saw her put herself in a bout of depression, harsh judgements to herself, and ultimately was just very unhappy all the time. I did all I could, telling her not to worry about it, cooking healthier meals, telling her shes just not as active. And eventually after 6 months of recovery we started to go back to the gym but she was never the same so. And after having to remind her everyday, every conversation that everything would be ok to no aval, I broke up with her. I regret this decision. I made this decision because I too, to some degree am self conscious and at the time I took it as a response to me. I thought she was unhappy with me. We ended up trying again a short 4 months later but it too was short lived. Same result, every conversation wed have, shed talk about her weight, and I could see in her face how unhappy she was. This was also a bad time in her family as her mother just got breast cancer. So she went back home. On the way home AL gt KY her car broke down and without hesitation I drove the 4 hours to meet up with her to fix her car and drove back because I still loved her. During this time covid began and any shot of seeing her was gone. I just started a 6 month coding boot camp where my days were pretty much planned from 8am8pm Monday  Saturday. We had talked about how I could be a developer, working from anywhere and I could be with her and she was a marine biologist, so her work was dependant on location so I was okay with going wherever she needed to be. While in the bootcamp, we rarely talked, living our separate lives.",

To this day, I cant ever get any medication for it either, but I save that little later. ampx200B By 12th grade, my grandfather had passed away, and he was the only thing I had to father like. My depression hits me harder and I just no longer had any desire for school. I begin skipping so much school that I was dropped from the program. I only stayed home, watch t.v and played video games. I get a job and I stayed there for five years. Naturally I find other work over time and keep going with jobs I hate. I move in with my mother at some point, I thought it be a good idea and grow closer to her. ampx200B My mother goes on to lie and steal from me the entire time Im with her. I had even tried to go back to school and get my GED but told down a lot. I pay money for something, and they would pocket it. I would sleep, and they steal my credit card and spend my entire paychecks. I was often treated like a third class citizen while living with them. ampx200B While attending GED school, it a massive struggle for me. I cant focus longer than 30 minutes and only a few times a week if that. I still have no medication to get back on or a way to get them.

What does bother me is that my Dads 70th birthday is just a reminder to me that I dont have much time left with him. At most another 10 years and thats optimistic. It just makes me so fucking sad beyond words to even think about. My Dad is my favorite person in the world and I can not even comprehend living a single day without him. I just wish so bad that I could be like every other fucking person and have a young Dad so I could have some more time with him. I truly dont know what Ill do when he passes. With how old he is, it feels like theres really no way of knowing, when. It makes me sick to even think about it. but the hard reality is is that he could really die this year even. Or he could miraculously live until 100. But deep down I know that I have less than 10 years with him and it FUCKING KILLS ME. anyways if you took the time to read this poorly written rant, thank you",
    "Suicidal and going to be a father So its a long story but basically Ive realised Today Im actually suicidal. Basic short of the story is. I was with my gf for 4 months was the most intense and passionate relationship Ive ever been in and Ive loved her more than Ive ever loved anyone. She announces shes pregnant and changes due to hormones ect and I struggle to cope due to the stress of finding out Im going to be a father so I drink and we argue constantly. Then she suddenly leaves me and i become a full on alcoholic drinking everyday in complete despair 6 weeks go past and Im too afraid to message her but I do think about this child and I cant just Abandon it so I Eventually decide message her to tell her I want to be a father to this child. She says she will let me be involved cause she wants the child to have a father. But tells me she never wants to get back together and just wants to be friends and civil for the child. Saw her for the first time in 6 weeks yesterday and I thought it would make me feel better but it doesnt just makes me feel worse cause the pain is so intense. Tells me she never wants to get back together with me and at this point I was looking at the floor my lips trembling and Im on the verge of tears and Im pretty sure she knew this and she said we could be friends but in a way that she was trying to comfort me and basically say atleast Im in your life in some way. She showed me the scan photo and today she went for another scan and sent me the video of the babys heartbeat and tbh I know I should be happy but Im not Im so depressed I just wanted cry cause I cant bear not being with her. Now I asked her for a pic of the baby scan and she said later shes out. I strongly suspect shes having sex with someone and I just cant cope.she left 6 weeks ago and Ive not been happy since Im constantly having to contain my tears and my anger and I just dont see the point anymore. Im even jealous of how much she talks about the child like thats all she cares about and I never mattered. I do want to be a good father to my child when its born but at the moment its hard to see past this pain. Any advice ?",
    "Dating someone with depression I am dating someone that is diagnosed with depression and anxiety. It can be a challenge for me at times as I have to do a lot of things alone they dont want to go out in public or mostly just sleep for 12 hours on their days off. We dont get to do the usual couple stuff too often because they dont like to be in public or around people when they arent at work. I love and accept this person as is. There is a lot of other struggles that comes with this so Id like to knowwhat are some things I can or should do to for my partner with depression?

    "Depression, anxiety and panic disorder(IBS as a bonus), dont know for how long i can take this shit. So i am 22, been anxious and depressed for many years but somehow managed to survive school, but after 11 months of working IBS hit me hard. Had to stop working because i just couldnt leave the house. That was almost 2 years ago, now i still cant leave house without taking good amount of benzos, i am non stop depressed and anxious and thanks to the IBS i have developed a panic disorder. I have tried everything that doctors could think of for the IBS itself but no luck. And for the mental problems, i have tried taking three types of SSRIs, SNRI, TCA and antipsychoticsin special dose to act like antianxiety meds and every one of them made me feel worse, one of them totaly broke me for two weeks. Tried therapy for months. And have been hospitalized for 10 days at psychiatric unit and left because i felt much worse there. So i thought i just need more time to fight this, so i tried get money from the states safety net for living with disability. They acknowledged that i cant function and cant have social life but told me that i can work just fine, so big fuck you to my face 34 of income taxes really pays off.... Now i got work that i can do from home but cant really do it, i have no motivation, no joy from learning it or finishing a project only stress from the huge struggle and probably going to lose the job in a few days. I just dont know what to do, feeling worse than ever, going to be jobless. Should i try another antidepressants even thought i am scared because of the previous bad side effects? I am really desperate. Any advice is really appreciated.",
    "Nothing, and I mean NOTHING helps Do you know whats worse than being depressed and not having your life in order? Being depressed and having your life in order, because if your life is already in order, there is nothing you can improve on and nothing you can do to try and get better meaning there is no hope. My life used to be a mess, but at least I had something to fall back onto. When I told people about my depression, they told me about all the things that helped them out like exercising, extracurricular activities, going out with friends, having good grades, eating well, etc. As someone that couldnt even get out of bed to take a shit, I listened to what everyone told me and did it all. I became an A studentathlete, Im not too good socially but I have a few friends that I talk to and occasionally hang out with, and I lost a lot of weight, but the entire time, I couldnt shake this feeling that everything was off. Theoretically, I should be happy right now, I have become something that I thought was impossible 2 years ago, but it has become clear by now that no matter what I do, I will still want to kill myself. I mean, I feel the same, if not worse than I did 2 years ago. I still stare at my dads pistol every time I walk past it in its case, I still think about cutting myself every time I see a blade. One single thing Ive noticed that has been with me since I was like 7, is that the thought of death is the only thing that brings me comfort in tough times. At this point, I feel like it wont be too long until that thought finally becomes reality.",

I also play softball, Im halfway decent but Im not good and it gets to a point where there are really good players on the team and I still end up sitting the bench, I even paid to be on the team and they didnt, I ended up paying to play this year but kind of have my heart set on quitting, its gotten to be toxic to me because I expect more out of myself than what happens, and just like the world everyone focuses on what you did wrong, not the many good things you have done. This quarantine has not helped me mentally and the constant ghosting, friends making plans without me, and softball. Thank you for listening.",

    "Requesting advice on how to (better) handle a depressive episode For me, some times its triggered by something like a bad day at work or even just out of nowhere. It always winds up the same way. I lose focus on whatever Im doing, procrastinate, eat whatever junk food I have onhand, then I wind up talking and screaming at myself as my mind feels like it turned against me. I feel better at the end of it but surely there have to be better ways of handling when these episodes strike? Comfort food and distractions like video games and watching youtube and twitch arent really cutting it anymore. All advice is appreciated. Thank you in advance.",
    "Any time i speak, my mom has to point out the negative mindset/thought processing of my head, whether the negativity is fact or opinion. Makes me feel like a loser who can only see the negative in today’s world.. &amp; i’m tired of beating myself up for it Im 22 amp have had depression amp anxiety for over a decade so this negative mindset that shows itself at times has always been present Anytime i talk about something, see something awful on my parents favorite channelthe news, or hear a conversation with points that i disagree with lot of morals, i get told by my mom why are you looking at this so negatively? why are you letting yourself get so worked up about this? its not even affecting you directly, so why do you have such a strong opinion on this? dont get so worked up about this, just let it go you only point out the negative things so im trying to show you the opposing view I understand that it is a good thing to show the opposing viewpoint so you can fully make your own opinion, but i have always been one to contemplate amp think of all point of viewsim pretty open minded in that sense but me being a sensitive person well an HSP, i seem to first always lean towards the emotional reasoning amp the rational part after, or secondary, of lesser importance. Probably because i know what its like to feel emotionally invalidnot cared aboutmisunderstood, so the sympathy for others is very present. but that also makes me question why I DO get so easily affected by being told basically well i feel it at least that im wrong or my thinking is wrong. I feel no one in my family really understands either where im coming from or how my mind works not that i expect them too, but i do expect a little acceptance so i dont continue to spiral down , continuously doubting myself amp beliefs because ive been told its wrong my whole life. Idk Does this make sense?",

    "I got cheated on by my now ex-boyfriend of six years and I feel worthless He said he hadnt loved me for a while. That when he said he wanted to get married that it was just a lie. Through all this I couldnt get him to see that he had lied and cheated. We argued the rest of the way home. At the exit to his apartment I made a comment of how if he cared for the person he was talking to he wouldnt have been a liar. That triggered him. He went into a screaming rage in my face while I was driving on the highway. It was verbal abuse. I feared for my safety in that moment and so I pushed him back. That made him even more enraged and put our lives in danger by grabbing a hold of my steering wheel and attempting to swerve us off the road. I ended up dropping him off at his apartment a few minutes after that and asked for my things back. Since I still had the girl on Snapchat I watched as how he had already rebounded not even after dropping him off. And so now Im just here. Feeling worthless. I cared for him I loved him. But I didnt even recognize him anymore and all I ever wanted to do was help him feel better. He didnt even have a regard for me anymore. He didnt even have the guts to tell me straight forward that he was breaking up with me and masked it with the excuse of needing space. And so Ive been writing this since 523 AM and now its 629 AM. I dont know how to feel. But I feel worthless.",

    "Being the boyfriend. I feel as if weve stopped growing and are maybe even starting to resent each other, which is scary to me. I get paranoid that shes cheating on me sometimes, which I highly doubt she is, I think its just me trying to rationalize the lack of sex. Most of all I feel like this entire relationship is about her, and its frustrating me lately. I honestly dont mean to sound like a jerk here Im certainly not entitled to anything and while I know her story better than anyone I have no idea what it was really like to experience those traumas growing up and how it effects her today. I dont even know how to explain how Im feeling. Im constantly having the internal debate Well what about me? Fuck about you! What about her!? And so on. While writing this post I kind of caught myself switching between my 2 headspaces. Headspace A That being said.. why cant it be about me sometimes? Shouldnt a relationship be 5050? Ive really never been an attention seeker so Im fine with 3070 or 2080? Anything at this point. Its not though, everything we do is dictated by her depression. Headspace B A few weeks ago while I was alone doing laundry I just started hysterically crying I couldnt breathe, it really freaked me out. Nothing like that has ever happened to me before. Earlier that day she had called me crying and saying she just wants it to be over. She just wants to give up. She wants to die I love her so much and im scared for her and for us. Am I just a shitty person for wanting it to be about me sometimes? I feel like a prick even saying that. Of course Ive never told her about this, she has enough to worry about and I want to be her rock, not another burden, a toddler, whining about not getting enough attention. So I dont say anything, instead I just get distant, which I recognize and I hate that I do that. Im just angry at this situation and dont know how else to react. I want our relationship to be what it once was fun and exciting. How can I help this relationship?",

I spent the last 45 minutes carefully putting together my story and tried to tell exactly what happened in the past year, but then the Reddit app decided to commit suicide before me and I am too furious to write all of this shit again, so Ill just get straight to the point I have lost all my friends. I get especially sad because even my best friend we have kissed several times... just doesnt care anymore. My mother doesnt support me at all.

I get insanely sad when I see other people having a good time, because Im stuck in this nightmare of not having any social contact whatsoever. But hey, at least I mastered social distancing before this Corona thing happened and I have no problem isolating myself... cause thats exactly what I did for the past nine months or so. I dont even need an external trigger like seeing other people having fun and I just get tears out of nowhere and I constantly think about what has happened to me. I sometimes dont even go to school because I would see people which mean a lot to me but treat me like a peace of garbage. I am terrible at school.

    "Has anyone else experienced these symptoms? My depression has always been severe, and I experience most symptoms other than an increase in energy and appetite. The worst symptom I used to have was intense pain in my chest as if someone were trying to rip out my heart. However, I just had my worst depressive episode ever, and it lasted for about a month. My symptoms were 1. Feeling as if I weigh a ton, and have immense difficulty moving 2. Nausea 3. Aforementioned chest pain 4. Tunnel vision 5. Blacking out Every time the sun went down, and sometimes during the day, these symptoms would occur simultaneously and in very high intensity at the drop of a hat. I never felt it coming, it was like a switch being flipped, and then I would suddenly be filled with the worst dread I had ever experienced and feel my head floating away from my body from the sheer intensity of the depression.

    "Death anxiety got me feeling like life is pointless and exhausting and it's all a nightmare. Hello! So iv been depressed and anxious for a long time i think but recently i started having thoughts about death every single day and its like i opened pandoras box. Death is so final, so scary. It makes life seem pointless, why build something up when its just a matter of time before it all ends and how am i supposed to enjoy this experience with a metaphorical gun to my head that i dont know when it will go off? I tried looking at spirituality and stuff because nobody knows what happens when you die right? But it seems logical that we just die and the other stuff is wishful thinking... and even if there were an afterlife that would kinda subtract from the meaning of living this one. This is one big bad boogieman that no adult can come and safe me from and its horrible.... So today and yesterday i started having more thoughts about dying, yesterday i went snorkeling and had to quit because i kept thinking about drowning and how that would suck. Today i thought that i might as well die now since nothing matters and its an inevitability and im tired of fighting. But they are thoughts and i feel some distance between me and the action.

Even my therapist has acknowledged that life wont be as much fun as living in a gaming world or watching cartoons, so whats the point? So far, the main answer seems to be you just have to do it.

    "i had to say goodbye to my sweet boy today after finding out yesterday cancer is ravaging his body. ive never wanted to simply wait in a waiting room longer, but they called us right back. i prayed that the doctor was tied up and would take a while before she got back there, but no sooner did i finish thinking that she came in. i felt myself detach from my body at that point. i cant remember anything she said, but i know from the time she came in the room to the time she left the room was only about five minutes. my babys body was so tired, it had been fighting so hard for so long. he was gone before the injection to stop his heart was even finished. my world and heart suddenly felt so... empty. i was wailing in the vets office, the pain is so deep. the doctor told me our grief is only a reflection of our love, and i believe that 100. i genuinely dont think i could love my boy even an OUNCE more because my little heart would give out. im back home now, my other dogs dont understand why their brother isnt here. i never ever expected my maximus to be the first to go. i have two other senior dogs, and maximus is the youngest. i felt so sure i had at least 34 more years with him, and i feel so robbed. i wasnt remotely prepared, i had zero clue this was coming. the one comfort i have is i dont feel remorse over the amount of time i spent with him. i dont feel like i wish i wouldve sat with him and pet him more because that dog was at my side constantly. any spare second i have im laying with him. anywhere i go, hes the one that gets up in the car and rides with me. he loves a car ride. i always surprise him with a mcdouble, and the excitement he shows never ever ever gets old. im not prepared for all of that to be a fond memory. im scared, because i know in time ill forget how it felt to pet that big block head and i dont ever want to.",
    "Can you act seemingly okay on the outside while battling an episode on the inside? Nondepressed person checking in here, btw. Thank you in advance for all the help. I am wondering if you guys have any insight into why depression can push individuals to act so out of characteralmost as if they believe everything is completely okay when, in reality, they are suffering on the inside. I assume this falls along the lines of dissociation or psychosis? Could those be the result from experiencing an intense amount of triggers?",
    "feeling kind of depressed (cycle) for a while 18 year old here. One day I kind of realized there was an ugly aspect of my face deep set eyes with some hyperpigmentation. I learnt thats a thing seen mostly in people of color amp has to do with facial structure or something like that. I think I had a panic attack because I was crying about it for a while and then became normal again. But the next day around the same time the same thing happened..then I was happy again Im of course one of many people who dont really call themselves pretty and never really considered it. But right now Im thinking maybe if I get therapy and stay there for as long as possible, Ill feel somewhat better or calm. I wont fall back into the cycle of feeling depressed about it, it was kind of traumatic. Dont really think its Body dysmorphia, or could it be? I dont really care about looks too much. But I hate seeing my face most of the time. Ive even been listening tousing affirmations amp frequencies on YouTube recently to change that ugly aspect so I can just look pretty ok. In other words it just sucks. I guess for some people many people obviously genes didnt work out so well. Wish I looked better. Then I would be carefree and not worry about this. Dont even know what I really am actually. Should people like me just give up..maybe not because I do have other interests which at least are entertaining. I like drawing, making edits amp watching videos, etc. I think Im falling into that depressive cycle again and I just want it to end. But I dont know how. Is there anyone else with a similar situation? Or just someone here with a solution or anything at all. Or just talk about life",

    "I've stopped doing things for myself Ive got this roommate situation going on where Im literally afraid of the person Im living with. Hes a drunk and can be erratic and most of the time I just stay holed up in my room with the door locked trying to stay under his radar. Hes supposed to move out at the end of the month, but you know, who knows if hell actually do that. Hes basically indigent so I see no reason for him to move to a new place and not instead just root himself here for us to evict him. My other roommate is in another country until February and I live in a completely different state from my family. Im isolated. That being said, Ive stopped caring for myself almost completely. I dont remember the last time I shaved, got a hair cut. Covid is a good excuse to not get a hair cut, but I feel just disgusting. Getting up and taking a shower doesnt work. I just lay back down. I might have a problem with my car, but I dont want to take it to the shop because Im afraid it might be my only escape if things get bad, and Id rather it die on the road from a fleeing event then just not have it at all. But at the same time, is that just my brain rationalizing? I dont know. I have to get it fixed though because I have to use it for work. I just feel hopeless. I dont know what to do to try and motivate myself but even knowing that this is a product of feeling sad makes me even more unmotivated.",
    "My Heart Feels Like It's Emotionally Bleeding I dont want to constantly worry. Im diagnosed with general and social anxiety with depressive episodes because of the aforementioned and it never ends. I have a wobbly relationship with alcohol, because it allows me some reprieve from the constant weight of worrying, but I have a tendancy to not be able to stop and get irritable, which is absolutely one of my biggest reasons to feel ashamed. Im cutting down, I dont consider myself an alcoholic but I feel its lack of presence. Ive been known to even go so low as to abuse a strong painkiller I was given from hospital for something unrelated. I feel lost a lot of the time and its come to a point where Id rather talk anonymously to people on the internet than my partner or friends because, for once, I want to be the reliable one, the happy one. The one everyone enjoys... People love my energy when I have my good moments, and honestly... I do too! I want more of it! But fighting your own mind on a constant basis, introverted... Always giving what I feel is 110, its draining, so draining... I desperately want to hear ways people cope. I feel I could write so much more but goddamn, Ive been hiding out in the bathroom for probably about 20 mins so Id better stop. Thanks for listening, Reddit.",
    "How to talk to me GP about my depression I have had progressively worsening depression since adter an abortion I had in May 2018. It started out as episodes of sobbing crying a lot and then I started having episodes of obsessiveinstrusive thoughts in December 2018. I started having thoughts of suicide this year. They started as instrusive thoughts and now they bring comfort. I live in a small town, surrounded by other small towns and there arent many options when it comes to mental health. I do have a GP that I really like and trust and my insurance pays for 1 check up a year and that is this Thursday. I want to talk to her about my depression and what I should do.

I have dropped out twice from uni and have only a part time job now. I finished high school with the schools best diploma and I know I have all this potential that Im just wasting. Just writing this out makes me feel so awful and spikes my anxiety really bad. I dont know what to do, I feel like its embarassing that Im not in a university and all those other people are Ik this is horribly selfish.

    "Both me and my spouse are depressed Then if there are any people, dogs, noises, or wind, he starts to panic, so I do too, he usually helps stabilize my moods, but were both afraid of people so it turns into a feedback loop. Hes house trained because most of the time, even when I get him hyped up to go outside and put his leash on, he just freezes at the door and refuses to go outside, and if I pick him up and put him down on the grass he just stands there. We live in a trailer park and our yard is about 10 feet wide, so theres no privacy. We both are hermits and dont like interacting with people and Im autistic so I just... cant converse verbally normally. We have no friends locally even though weve been here for a few years. I just got out of a bad friendship and at this point cant really be bothered to try to have another friend in fear Ill get myself in the same situation. On top of everything, Im going through an existential crisis and find no comfort in my hobbies I used to enjoy. Neither of us really do anything. We play video games and I draw, but thats about it. I have suicidal tendencies but havent tried for a while, but have been close to downing pills again. He isnt suicidal per se, but when hes at work he gets thoughts akin to ideations, but when were together were both fine. At this point, I honestly dont know what to do. Sure, theres plenty of stuff to be done, but I have issues prioritizing things, so I just see this long list and get overwhelmed and end up doing nothing. Our pets and plants still get cared for, and I can do some house chores our place is a fixer upper to say the least, but most of the day I just sit in paralyzing existential dread. Im too dead set on rationing my medicine from trauma that I either wont allow myself to take my sedatives even when I should or am scared that Ill have the urge to eat them all and kill myself. Dont overdose, kids, it aint as romantic as the movies make it out to be. It just feels hopeless.",

    "I don’t know how to help my depressed friend. Hello everyone, Ive come here for help or advice on what to do for one of my good friends. This might be long because theres a lot to unpack here. She19 has dealt with depression ever since middle school. I didnt know her at that time, only the past couple years and this year has she started opening up to me. She comes from a family that is overly strictly Christian. Both of her parents dont really believe in mental illnessmental help and her mother constantly gaslights her saying her depression isnt real and gets told to just suck it up or that she doesnt have anything to be depressed over. She tells me all the time about how shes tired, feeling sick constantly, body aches, has zero energy all of the time. It doesnt help that she works 40hweek. Ive been pushing seeing a psychiatrist or counselortherapist, and she wants too, but she also suffers from severe anxiety and absolutely despises the thought of hiding something like that from her parents because even just thinking about it sends her into a anxiety attack of sorts. Recently though, I feel like its gotten worse. Whats even worse is that Im the only person she talks to about this sort of thing, or I guess the only person she really talks too often in general, but recently shes started to push me awaydistance herself. I dont know if she means too, or if shes doing it purposely, but I dont know what to do. This scares me. Im trying to be there as much as I can but its starting to become difficult. This breaks my heart and I dont know what to do. Thanks for taking the time to read this. Ill answer any questions best I can.",
    "I’ve been feeling down lately Hello reddit. I dont know if Im lazy or depressed, but over the past few weeks Ive been feeling empty. I feel so emotionally numb and I started to lose interest in things I used to enjoy, like playing video games. Im in high school, and Im so overwhelmed by homework because of the pressure that I have to do them perfectly. So much that I just dont want to do anything at all. My parents call me lazy, but I really dont know if thats true. So I looked up what depression was, and I was like yep, I probably have this, but my mind is going back forth from thinking Im depressed or faking it. Its confusing because Im still able to carry out tasks like chores, but at the same time I feel like I only do it because I have to. I also easily get upset over little things, like when my parents try to lecture me. It reminds me that Im a failure. A bad child. And Ill never be enough for anyone. Then I start beating myself up because of it, because that was my only coping mechanism. I would just punch my own arm or hand to release that energy. It hurts, but I dont care. I can still enjoy some things, like painting. But eventually that enjoyment goes away, and I go back to that feeling. I ruminate over past social interactions, and I just sit down and do nothing. Ive always been tired and lacked energy, but I think its because I dont get much sleep. But another thing is, I get hyper around my friends, which is why I have these conflicting thoughts about depression. Sometimes, I would unexpectedly start to fidget and do everything quickly, but that energy goes away when Im alone. My mood goes up a but all those thoughts and feelings come back eventually. I cannot afford therapy, nor want my parents to be involved. Im not an adult yet either, but I feel like I need help. Does this sound like depression? If not, then what is it?",

I make music and thats cool, but I never go out, never want to do fun things with my partner, never want to do much of anything besides play video games and watch youtube while mindlessly scrolling. Its putting a real strain on my life because I used to love going out but I just feel so eh about everything now to the point that when I do make myself do things it feels like a chore. Any advice you guys can give me? Medication suggestions? Things I can do myself?",
    "I've been depressed a long time and I'm really struggling right now I think Ive had depression for my whole life or at least early in my life, I was on the path toward depression. Now Im an adult and I feel like Im only getting worse as time goes on. Each time I get low Im going lower and its lasting longer. At about the end of the lockdown in my area, I had a breakdown. I had a panic attack that lasted for far too long and then for weeks afterward I would have them multiple times a day and for hours. Its not as bad as that anymore but the anxiety has been worse since then. I dont know how to describe the severity of my problem. Examples I guess could be I quit my job five months ago in large part for my mental health but also a myriad of other reasons of course and have not returned to work since. I had an injury that will likely require surgery and Ive been avoiding the doctor for going on seven months now and Its getting worse as a result. I also spend most of my days doing mostly nothing but find distractions from doing anything meaningful and have consistently failed to break that pattern. I want to live my life and I dont know if Im qualified to handle this on my own anymore but I dont know what to do. I dont want antidepressants and things like that. The thing is, I know what the things are that help me. Having a schedule and sticking to it, not smoking weed and fasting. Like, I remember what it was like when I was feeling better than I am now. Im just struggling to not keep falling. I feel like Im beginning to ramble so before this becomes a rant, can someone offer me some advice?",

I wanted to make friends out of that ghetolike community, but I couldnt get out of it. Within the community I met someone I thought was my friend, but who ended up manipulating me.

I attempted suicide ten days after my birthday. And eversince that moment I have nightmares of it. ampx200B Ive given up many things within a few months. I dropped my studies.

    "My Heart Feels Like It's Emotionally Bleeding Just a quick one because Im at work currently. On mobile. I feel like I have an average amount to be proud of, especially considering how far Ive come in a short time. I used to be a failure, honestly. I was on medical financial benefits, boyfriend dumped me not nastily I might add but he was my world, had no desires for my future because I think I honestly believed that I couldnt achieve anything. Not gonna go into too much detail about my current partner because hes not reeeeeally the subject here.

More than anything, Im thankful to him for showing me that I am strong enough. I have a job through him he moved from South to North of my country and dropped into a job, a few months later putting the good word in for me and getting me an interview and has reminded me of what purpose of life means... We have recently reserved a new, gorgeous build in the town we have come to love, and the coming month we will be reserving it. I can finally get a corgi my favourite dog breed, if the name doesnt give it away haha and my life has some substance. I will have a house, a dog, a loving partner and lots of friends, as well as a hobby that I love. I can buy games for my Switch and have a generously donated, very decent graphics tablet to draw on.

    "Is my \"popular\" intensive trauma program abusive/unfit/re-traumatizing for me? I feel like my intensive trauma program is deeply harming me. I wanna talk about it with people outside my treatment team. So, Ive outlined my history and concerns as concisely and as comprehensively I could.. any input is appreciated lt3 You can skip sections if you like. ampx200B Background  Im a young adult female. Ive struggled with CPTSD for many years now as a result of childhood trauma and adult experiences of abuseviolence. I slipped into a severe depressive episode this year after a sexual assault. I have a caring primary care doctor and a psychiatrist  they want to help me manage the intense levels of panic and depression Ive recently experienced while using minimal medication. Ive been on mirtazipine an antidepressant for 4 weeks and Im able to function more reduced depression but ongoing anxiety. I am also trying to eat more and gain weight as I am underweight. Issues Nightmares resulting insomnia, panic attacks that last 26 hours, flashbacks, hyper vigilance, dissociation, physical pain, anxiety, depression. I also experience a lot of self doubt and self blame. No history of hallucinations, drug misuse, or violence towards others. All of the above have improved significantly while being on mirtazipine. I am now able to sleep regularly and eat well when before I was neither able to sleep nor eat due to the level of panic symptoms I was experiencing. Mere improvements in sleep have allowed me to better manage anxiety and panic when they do happen. My goals  I want help with regulating sleep, food, and mood so I am more equipped to manage triggers and painful memories, while also creating a future worth moving towards. My bodys responses are natural responses to an unnatural situation of abuse. I want to be able to listen to my body and give myself what I need, which is tenderness, kindness, and respect. I expect respect and gentleness from people I interact with as well  it is essential for my healing.

    "Depressed Partner (quarantine) Hi! F29 M29 My partner of 2 years asked me for space on Thursday after his therapist appointment. He said he didnt want to make any rushed decision breakup until he had a more clear view of things. We had just moved in together in January and now he isnt sure if he was ready. He has been struggling with being stuck at home, no sports on tv, and me nagging him to get out of the house with me for walks or just even eating in our patio. I had no background or knew how to deal with depression so I cried and made him feel responsible for what he was feeling. He said he was confused and didnt know if the quarantine or our relationship where the real cause of his depression. I left but didnt even hug him. I made some research and felt so gulty of not being compassionate to him and went back on Friday to beg him to trust me. He said he still needed time but that everything I had said helped him. I stayed away but reading everything I could, joined TalkSpace which has helped me a lot and felt very connected with people going through the same thing. I slowly realized his illness made him so unworthy of love that he felt that me being out of his life would help him. I kept on sending text of encourganmet once a day and have food, essentials deliveries to the house the quarantine does not help. Today I came over in the morning and let our dog out and fed her. He was still in bed, I came in the room hugged him and reassured I would always be here. He had a drainedsad look on his face but hugged me back.

Iam just waste of flesh, i should have been aborted, and no iam not just in this mood at the moment, thats how I always feel, I realized it a long time ago but there is just not a cure for my hate jealousy and whatever sin from the Bible I embody. If God exists and if he truly punishes those who deserve it, than why am I not already dead. Also why cant I change, why was I born this way, why was I bullied so hard in high school, why am I gay, why could I never experience love till now? Just end me so that no one has to deal with me anymore.",
    "Nervous breakdown I think Im having a breakdown. I have been battling a depression, mostly brought on by outside circumstances, for almost a year. Right now Im under so much stress I feel inhuman. Today I was given news that has, rocked my very existence and Im in more pain than Ive ever been. I had very long, butt length hair. I just took scissors and cut it all off. I dont know why. Im also shaking all over and can barely move. I can barely talk. I also feel emotional pain so deep that it is hurting my chest area, stomach area, physically. What is happening to me?",
    "I’m sick of everything, my life is just meant to be miserable. I was never liked at school. I felt like outsider wherever I went. Nobody was ever in love with me. I never had a friend, first people that I started to hangout with I met a year ago. For majority of my life I was overweight, at some point I was even obese. I lost over 50lbs 23kg a year ago and I do everything to maintain my weight on a healthy level. I have to be focused on what I eat, I gain weight in the matter of days. Every cheat day feels like one step closer to my past self. My relationship with food is extremely bad and I dont know how to change it. I dont fit anywhere. I dont feel good in any place, I shout my mouth around people for them not to be forced to hear about my problems that sometimes spill out through my mouth unintentionally. Who would want to be around with such a loser for longer anyway? I met a boy online, after a couple of months we became really good friends. We always have something to talk about, we share so many experiences and he respects me and wants only good for me. I had a hard time with men because of my father, I never believed they would value me or they would use me quickly after getting along. But this guy showed me that there are good men out there, with a softer side and responsible mind. After talking and calling each other for a longer time I realized how safer and calmer I feel now that hes in my life. Even unconsciously I feel his gentle presence. Now I think that I realized what does love mean and that I have feelings for him. Hes from a different country though. I was saving up for plane tickets and the trip there, I started planning everything in March and look, its July and nothing happened. Even though I was researching all the legal information, translating documents, buying necessary things, keeping myself updated on flights, Im still here. And I have no idea if I will ever get there. There are too many obstacles.",
    "Severe depression Something many people dont understand is that being suicidal isnt always I want to kill myself I wouldnt want to do that. But I just want to die. I just want all the thoughts screaming in my head to stop. Its like Im underwater at a busy public pool and just hearing constant yelling and shouting. Not voices but just thoughts. Im thinking about getting hospitalized. I need to get help. I need to get out of my house. Im in a hoarding situation. Like I DO want to get rid of stuff and organize. But I have zero energy to do so. I get so overwhelmed when I start. I want to reach out for help and have others come over to help me but Im afraid of being judged for how bad its gotten. I just want to go to sleep and not wake up so I can escape everything I tried to talk to my boyfriend about it tonight and hit a total brick wall with him.

I can feel pain and heaviness in my chest. Im a khv NEET, I should be in college but Im wasting my life going to sleep at 6am and waking up at 3pm.

I live in Cambodia which is somewhat poor, and from what Ive heard from here, Im not sure if I should trust them or not. I need some advice.",
    "Suicide bereavement making existing depression intolerable Obvious TW for suicide My depression is worse than ever since my little sister died by suicide last year. Like beyond normal grief, it worried my suicide bereavement counselor type stuff. I cant post on the suicide bereavement sub because my grief makes me suicidal and I dont want to trigger anyone over there. When I posted on suicidewatch everyone ignored me and I got embarrassed and took the post down after like 6 hours. I just feel so depressed and dont want to be here right now. Im doing my best to stick around for my family but its hard. Im not excited about my career, my relationship, my prospects for ever living a good life. I just want to sleep until my next therapy appointment on Monday and then sleep until the one after that and soforth. I dont believe my life is ever going to get better and Im just so done. Last time I tried the hotline I couldnt get through to anyone and I wasnt an active threat so Id probably get triaged out anyways. What do I do?

While I lay on my bed with no bed sheets or blankets, I look at pictures of clean bedrooms on Pinterest wishing it could be me. But the clean sheets and pillows and blankets are right next to me just waiting to be put on. But I never do. Its probably been 3 weeks that theyve been sitting there. Obviously Id be more comfortable with sheets and blankets, but I cant seem to get myself to put them on. I constantly get kicked for having a dirty room. I dont want it like this. I want my room to be clean. I want people in. Please what can I do to break this cycle. Im not sure if this is depression, or whatever it could be, but I am willing to change it. Ill do anything. I also cant seem to cry anymore. Even though I feel the urge, the tears never come out. My heart always has this heavy and hurting feeling to it. I dont want to be like this. I want to enjoy my youth. Im not suicidal at all I promise. So please do not worry about that. I would never have such selfish actions towards the people I love. Im just ready to enjoy life again.",
    "I'm so tired This years been shit, I just cant deal with it anymore. Ive tried so hard to be strong and do everything i could to feel better but its just gotten too much. Last year during summer I felt awful, no other way to describe it. Originally I thought it was from the quarantining, not seeing my friends, having to see the really state of the world that time was a very cold realization to a lot of problems in my country that just left me confused, sad and annoyed, but the more I looked for answers the more confusing it got. I just wouldnt feel better, Id sleep all day, not have the motivation to do anything I used to like, it was awful. Seeing friends and being around them apparently covered up a lot of what Ive been feeling. I spoke to a therapist towards the end of summer and it was pretty obvious I had an actual form of depression. In retrospect its probably been there for a while. A few years ago I remember random bouts of feeling miserable despite everything in my life seemingly going well, along with it hitting like a truck when things went poorly. Last year I remember not really doing anything I enjoyed, even basic things like turning on a game felt monumental, let along sitting down and drawing something, so for months on end I just didnt. Talking to a friend also made me realize just how far back it went, I dont really remember it at all but he told me about a time in seventh grade where I told him I was depressed. So here I am almost a year after its been diagnosed, a complete mess. Back to the end of summer, throughout the entire thing i fought with my family a lot, they didnt exactly care for the whole deadly virus thing and kept taking us out to see people. It was really confusing for me, it seemed so simple just wear a mask and stay home for a while to keep other people safe, but here I was arguing with my parents about how we shouldnt be going out. Thats when the topic of school opening came up, there was a virtual and hybrid option, I wanted to stay home and they were dead set on getting me back in.",

I have no money and no car so often i just sit at home and work out, watch tv or go on tik tok but i have little motivation for anything else. Even though i am working out and doing things to improve myself i still have very low self esteem because i cant help but overthink about what people think of me and what ive done in the past. When i hang out with my friends we dont do much and its always the same boring activities. I drink and i smoke so i can be happier and not think about life. Im not suicidal but i just feel like i am stuck in a rut and i hate being alone. what are things i can do in order to feel happier and more confident in myself, as well as things i can look forward to in life so i dont feel so stuck?",
    "Should I get myself checked in to a psychiatric ward so they can force me to start my antidepressant? The more scared I get the worse my anxiety gets. The worse my anxiety gets the more I get scared, and it gets even harder to start my medicine. Lately I havent been able to think about anything else other than my bowel issues, I cant even watch a youtube video. Im not suicidal I have suicidal thoughts yes but I havent made any plans, and I have things I want to do, you know? I dropped out of college, and I want to go back. Im not even exaggerating when I say this I see myself going back to school literally every night in my dreams. I have gender dysphoria, and I want to at least know how it feels like to be comfortable in your own body. And these things keep me going. But I also know that I have to take my medicine, and I just dont know how I can do that. I thought of a couple things that I can try. First, I can get myself checked in to a psychiatric ward. Make them force me to take my medicine. There are several upsides and downsides with that. If I get an anxiety attack they can intervene. I will be forced to take the medicine, so it has a higher probability of success. But on the other hand, the psychiatric wards in my country have some problems. Ive read a lot about human rights violations, abuse, mistreatment, violence etc. And Im sure you can understand, I dont need this stuff on top of my problems. Also since Im not a danger to myself or to others they might not even accept me. Also my parents will probably be very angry with me, because I dont look very nervous or stressed from outside. Second, find a way to start taking them on my own. I can ask to start from a lower dose. My psych wanted me to start at 150mg. Effexor XR is available with dosages as low as 37.5mg. I can ask for anti anxiety medication. I have anti nausea medication, and I can take that while starting.",

    "Help Changing for the Better Ive suffered silently with depression and anxiety for most of my life, usually covering it up with relationships or alcohol. Long story short, my depression and anxiety stems largely from childhood and teenage bullying and growing up in a home with very unhappy parents who werent meant to be parents. It wasnt until recently, on the verge of divorce, that Ive moved past the stigma of depression and admitted that I suffer from it. Ive been taking high doses of CBD and ltheanine daily Ive seen the unintended, scary side effects of prescribed antidepressents too often in former friends, in addition to daily meditation, getting outdoors daily for at least 30 mins, daily exercise and changing to a healthier, mediterranean diet. All of this had helped tremendously, but I still have occasional bad days like today where its a struggle to start my day. Due to my ongoing depression and anxiety, I havent used my brain the way it is supposed to be used, and as a result, I am very slow at thinking and making decisions in the heat of the moment. This has caused nothing but pain for me in romantic relationships and with roommates. I feel so incredibly stupid. I desperately need to change, and I have been trying, but it hasnt been easy. Every time I say this week is going to be different, it isnt. I get into constant arguments with my roommate because of my slow thinking and ingrained selfishness. I am reaching out for advice from anyone who has been where Ive been and made it through. How did you finally change for the better? Im at my wits end. I really want to change, I really do. My roommate says I cant because I just dont care enough. But I do care. I just cant figure out for once and for all how to improve myself 10x more e.g., my memory, my intelligence, my selfishness, being more aware of my surroundings, and most importantly, truly living life. Thank you very much for any advice anyone can give.",

    "I think I’m helpless. I am a 19 year old female who has been struggling with depression since I was about 9 or 10. When I started college this past fall, I thought Id get a new start. It went well for the first couple of weeks, but as time went on, my depression took away my chance of making something out of my life. I missed two months of classes because getting out of bed physically made my limbs feel heavier and like I was going to faint. I got a 1.0 GPA last semester and have since then been placed on academic probation. I am taking one class this semester, online. I had a job for most of the school year, but my last day was a few days ago. I am now isolated from society into my room at my parents home with my fish. I try to see my friends, but theyre busy making something out of their lives. My only friend right now is my boyfriend. Con to that, we live in the same city, but he goes to a college two and a half hours away. I dont get to talk to him much since he works 25 hours a week and is also a full time student. I am going to therapy, and it helps a little. However, I am still stuck in my room most days wondering where I went wrong. I hate to just blab on about how hard my life is, but damn. I am stuck. I want to live to see the good days, but these bad days are swallowing me whole. I want to feel better. I want to be a better person. I feel like Im screaming and no one can hear me. My parents refused to take me to the hospital when they caught me trying to kill myself last fall. They dont want their reputation we live in a tightnit, elitist little village to be ruptured by their troubled daughter. Im not sure what to do anymore. Please, someone. Help me.",

    "Today I reached my rock bottom I flunked the bar twice and what is more painful is that ALL my friends passed. I am happy for them but there is a part in me which thinks I am inadequate for not being able to pass it. Everyone I know, even those who do not do well in law school made it. No comforting words can console me. Every time I take a nap I really I would die. I am even having this evil thought I get corona virus or something. My sister shouted fake news when she thought I passed. I saw their excitement. My parents ran towards me. But when I said I actually failed again they just turned their back and left. No comfort whatsoever. So now I am all alone. Images of my ex when we were breaking up during my bar review was recurring and his words which go like I have nothing to be proud of. I just proved him right. My friends are all cheering up on me but everything is just cliche. And what do I expect? They cannot mourn with me bec they are all celebrating. I am currently employed in a law firm that I love but if I have to take the bar again, I need to resign to pave way for my review. I also dont want to stay because the work would get me reminded that I am not a lawyer. It is heartbreaking to leave a firm I finally love.

    "I’m lost, stuck and desperate Im at a point in my life where I am extremely depressed and have strongly considered suicide. I always feel weak and tired, with no motivation or willpower to do the simplest of tasks. I feel like any motivation I have to better myself is weaker than my will to end my life. I live in a moderately poor house we have the money to put food on the table and pay bills, but the slightest slip and were homeless, Im 20 and dependent on my parents, my dad who is also depressed and unhappy with his job, my mom is chronically ill and bedridden for the most part. I love my parents to death, but I could never let myself ask them for help, Im already a burden enough as it is, and I couldnt live with myself if they felt any guilt for the way I feel and not being able to afford help for me. I tried to have a simple retail job that I thought I could handle so Id be able to support myself, but I had to quit on my first full day because I was too weak to physically stand the whole work day, and couldnt be of much use. It was the most embarrassing and shameful day in my life and that incident sent me even further into depression. The only reasons I havent killed myself yet is because I love my mom, and because I still have hope that someone out there will someday choose to love me, and the prospect of raising a family with that woman is the only hope I havent lost. But the more and more time progresses, even that hope is starting to dwindle. I feel like my cowardice is whats really getting in the way of my killing myself, but I dont know how long it will keep me back. What can I do?",
    "Want go back to my life before all of this. Please help! How can I get over this obsessive fear of others opinions? It is ruining my life Im not sure if this is OCD, but I 19F have been dealing with intrusive thoughts for almost 6 months now. They are somewhat similar to POCD, but I get gruesome intrusive images of men abusing children it is never me, and I also get intrusive thoughts like what if she is being abused and what if that father is a pedophile who is abusing his child?. I think I have these thoughts because I absolutely detest and fear child sexual abuse, more than any other act in this world. The thoughts are distressing, but I have been able to use online resources and tips in order to decrease the amount of thoughts. Lately though, I have been worrying over the groinal response, which is debilitating. I could tell immediately that it was not arousal. And it usually doesnt happen at the moment of the intrusive thought, it happens while I am ruminating and when my anxiety is at its peak. I can tell that this truly doesnt mean anything because of the fact that it just happens when I am super anxious. I could be watching a tv show involving nothing sexual, and get a groinal response due to anxiety. Though, whether I am anxious about being aroused by the gore in the show, I dont know. I think one of my fears, that lines up with POCD, is that I would EVER be attracted to any form of sexual child abuse. Because I used to watch shota as a child and read inappropriate underage fanfiction, this fear has somewhat tangible evidence. Even though I was the same age as the characters, it still disturbs me. I know for a FACT that I have no interest in children, and that I never have I am attracted to men at least 5 years older then me. This groinal response has me questioning though why would I have this if I did not fear being aroused by children? . Even though this technically doesnt mean anything, does the groinal response indicate that I think I am a pedophile? It is confusing, but I guess my fear isnt that I am a pedophile because Im not.",

    "Feeling at the end of the line A couple years later I met my first long relationship girlfriend and as you can imagine I fell hard for her and spoiled her like crazy, she helped my reconnect with my father and I told her about my trauma and to my surprise she also was a victim, we both tried to get professional help within our means but only I got serious about it and kept going to my sessions, she said she was fine on her own and knowing how hard this was I let her take her own choice and just tried to be supportive when needed, needless to say it ended bad, near the end when we were about to move in together I tried to start a conversation about how we began getting together and how special she was to me, apparently I was the only one that felt that way because she told me that the only reason she kissed me and begun hanging out with me was because she felt pity for me, we had other issues like a poor sexual life and not enough time on her part for us, so after she told me about how we really had begun our relationship I felt numbed and after a few days in emotional hell I broke up with her, I listed all that was wrong with the relationship and told her that something that begins with pity cant have a future, I wasnt able to tell her that that was what hurt me the must, she never apologized and we went our separate ways, her family loved me and knew I was the good guy and I was the best for her and tried to help but never went passed of a small conversation with me, they were harder on her but in the end they are her family, I found out she also cheated later on and it was what killed the last pieces of love I had for her, I didnt confront her about it and we never spoke ever again, the pity confession destroyed my self confidence we were together for close to 4 years. So after that and having gotten some more help with my trauma I went on the quest to become the best version of me and was doing ok, over a year later I meet my current wife, a person so beautiful that has made me feel what is real love and allowed me to love freely again, but another kind of problems fell onto us, financial problems.",

I feel as though Ive wasted my time on this planet spending it alone, but then I find myself equally unhappy when I am around people. It seems like Im incapable of enjoying my own company or the company of others. I want to change this but whenever I open myself up to other people, it comes with emotional stress that I just dont know how to internalize. I know that if I continue down this road I am almost certainly committing myself to a life of isolating misery or suicide. I just dont know how to live any differently. And because this has been a theme for me so long, its become a part of my identity in a way to be depressed like this. It feels as though any attempt to change this underlying cause would be a betrayal to my true self or something. I want to change things, I dont want to commit myself to a life of isolation and apathy. I would like to have genuine and meaningful connections with people and feel like I have some sort of meaning in being alive.. But I just find that nothing makes me want to wake up the next morning. There is no underlying passion for life, just the motions. I have been to more therapists and psychiatrists than I can count on my hands, I just dont know what to do anymore. Apologize for the rant, this all just hitting me hard as of late.",
    "My (24) boyfriend (30) told me having a child is the only point of life and if he found out he was infertile, he would kill himself. He wants to see me pregnant and watch our child go to school and comfort them if they got bullied etc. He wants someone to take care of him when he gets old. Biologically, having a child is the only point of living and so having a child would cure his depression. I asked him what he would do if it turned out he was infertile and he point blank, no hesitation said he would kill himself. So that was extremely scary. I dont know what to do anymore. Ive tried to get him to go to therapy, but he sees absolutely nothing wrong with his worldview and i dont know how to convince him otherwise. Obviously, it is okay if we have to break up because our life paths are different, but honestly, hes done a lot of drugs weightliftingbodybuilding related and there is a very real possibility that hes infertile. I love him to pieces and will be crushed ifwhen we break up, but I dont know what i would do if he killed himself. Does anyone have any ideas for how to show him that the point of life is not only having a child? And yes, i did mention adoption which would provide the same tribe and care for him when hes old that hes so fixated on but he said he didnt want to adopt. Im just really worried and scared right now. Thank you all in advance. TLDR  my boyfriend thinks having a child is the only point to being alive and if he cant have a child he would just kill himself. I dont want a child but i also dont want him to kill himself. Help!",
    "My friends doesn't believe in be and doesn't respect my wish to be alone for a while I know its not her wish, but thats how it affects me... My therapy sessions is mainly about relations. I dont understand them and this is also why I need to start the therapy alone and then, slowly this or the next month, I will begin to open up again and see some friends again. I just cant function now, because this things with ST gives me troubles breathing. I couldnt sleep and I havent been able to eat anything this morning or do my morning yoga, because I cant deal with this. Its too much. And my therapy session was yesterday which also knocked me out and I have to wait 2weeks to get there again, so now Im stuck with these thoughts.. I really need some perspection, some advices, on how to deal with this. lt3 Please lt3",
    "19 years old and its pretty obvious there's no reason to go any further To live without being under someone elses rule? Or is that gift only given to animals in nature who dont have to live by human code? Id literally rather be dead or anything else other than human. I just dont know what to do anymore I just live each day so sad and depressed, nothing excites me anymore and I have absolutely no motivation to even try anything anymore. I 100 dont blame drug addicts for their choices in life, smoking weed does help me feel better about myself and the position Im in but at the end of the day all it does is make me feel better about life in that exact moment and does nothing for me in the long run which from my point of view seems completely doomed of being meaningful anyways. Id love to have two children but if they had to go through what Im going through right now then all their pain and depression would be all my fault and this life just isnt something Id want to give to someone else its just not worth it. Im too much of a wimp to just shoot myself but at the same time itd just be so easy, I just hope that some accident happens to me thats quick and painless. Theres a gun safe in my brothers room and just about every day I just imagine how peaceful itd be after I kill myself to no longer be bound to this unforgiving world. Its almost too good to be true but I guess thats a fair trade for my life.",
    "I am nothing anymore So I have been depressed all of my life as long as I can remember. I didnt really know what its like to not have that sinking, dreadful feeling in my heart. That is until I met my current boyfriend. He makes me feel alive and happy again. He pulled me out of the darkness I was so deep in. But I can feel myself starting to slip again, and Im trying so hard to not let it drag me down. I used to self harm, and I promised him Id try as hard as I could to not do it again. For like 3 weeks before the present one, I was completely absolutely numb. I didnt laugh, didnt cry, didnt feel anything at all. It was the worst feeling in my life, It felt like I just died and had no soul or heartbeat, but worse. It was terrifying, and I never want to go through it again. But after about three weeks of feeling that way, I selfharmed, partially to prove I could still feel something. And for some reason, I didnt feel the sadness I usually do when I relapse. I just felt alive. And I slipped out of that terrible numb feeling. I feel alive now, and still numb, but not as bad as before. But the problem is, Ive slipped into a different type of numbness. Its like I dont care about anything anymore. I have 3 grades below a 50, and I really dont have the energy or motivation to care, even though I want to. I honestly wouldnt care If i just got hit by a truck or like had a heart attack, but its not like im gonna go out of my way to make it happen. I want to stop this before it slips too deep but I dont know how.",

    "Is this a symptom of depression? Lets say that you want to do or change something in your life. A new hobby, learn a new skill etc. You know how to get started... but you never actually do it. You lack the energy and the motivation to start or keep going even though it is something you like and know it would improve your life. But you end up just fantasizing about it and not actually do it. If it is a symptom of depression, then I have been suffering from it without my knowledge for almost 5 years. I thought I was just lazy. There are so many things I want to do and learn that are in the realm of possibility, but I never do them. For the past 5 years Ive been on autopilot about this because I thought that was just how I am. But apparently its depression holding me back? There has been stuff this year that Ive suspected is the cause of why I feel sad all the time, but I never knew not doing what you want to do is a symptom too. If its true then I have missed a large part of my life to depression without knowing about it. Im 20 now so it started when I was 15.",

    "Can depression cause a bad memory? When I was a young teenager I was diagnosed with depression and an anxiety disorder. My entire teenage years were dedicated to getting better and school  friends were not my priority. I still had friends, but I didnt see them as much as most people see their friends. I went to a clinic to treat my suicidal thoughts and anxiety, so I missed out on a year of school. I finally got better when I was 18, but now I am in my twenties and Im realising that I barely have any memories from that time. I do have some clear memories, but most are related to my depression, but I can almost never remember any fun stories my friends bring up, that I was apparently involved in. Its 67 years of a weird blur. I keep seeing people posting pictures of themselves as teenagers, and talking about how crazy that time was and how much fun they had in high school. Their first job, their first boyfriend, their first drink. I am glad I got to the point where I am doing a lot better. But I do feel like a I missed out on a huge part of childhood, and dont have great social skills because of it. I was wondering if its normal to have a vague memory of such a huge chunk of your life, and if depression could be to blame? English isnt my native language, sorry for any mistakes",

    "I've been lying about having hope I just need advice. Ive been helping my friends through their mental issues with positive affirmations and hope for the future. But its a lie, I dont believe anyone has a future, life sucks then we die. Sometimes I feel bad for trying to keep them from killing themselves, as I believe they will be happier that way. I dont want to think this but Ive never seen anyone live a happy life. I need support , sadly from redditors, because I dont think my friends can handle anything negative rn. Rant I probably think this way because as a child I watched my family overwork themselves, working multiple jobs to support me and my siblings, just to go home and be miserable. Mental illness kept them from being happy as a child, they never had the time to be happy as an adult, and being elderly is driving them to madness. My family has high expectations for me but I dont see the point. Its not like having a good job or money will make me happy. Mental illness has stolen my youth, ill overwork myself as an adult to eventually retire to a life of feeling that I wasted away.",
    "I’m not sure if it’s depression, I just see no point in living. This is my first post on Reddit and Im not really sure where else I can talk to. For the last 2 years or so Ive lived every day bored, and I mean bored as in bored of having no friends or people to talk to, bored of constantly feeling like shit and knowing Im causing the ones closest to me pain, bored of spending 40 minutes scared to leave the house because of how bad I look. Ive not seen a point in living for a long time now and people around me ask why Im so down or why I dont talk much and I just see no point, I know none of them care about me or care about the answer so whats the point in replying. Every night I go to bed I literally pray to god, even though I dont believe in him, that I die in my sleep as Im too scared to actually kill myself. I get so easily pissed off and pissed off at the fact I feel like this, I have so much more than most people and what most people could ask for and I just still feel like a constant shit bag always letting down others and as everyone around me says oh you have so much to do etc and youre only 17 none of it matters. I just hate every day as it goes on and theyre just all merging into one big day. I dont remember the last time I was genuinely excited about something or happy for something that I wasnt forcing myself to feel. I just want to be happy, its all I want. What can I do when there seems to be nothing that can make me happier.",
    "Should I just indulge? Ive been working really hard on my mental health for several months now, pushing myself through difficult times to keep taking care of myself. Recently I started a mood stabilizer that has increased my appetite. During my depression, my appetite would decrease so it has actually felt really nice to crave food again. I dont get pleasure in most of the things that I used to enjoy, yet I have been keeping up on my diet, exercise, sleep, and social life despite all this. At this point I just of just want to indulge and take a break, but doing this doesnt really help in the long term. The only indulgence I can think of is pizza, and that is a very temporary one that will have a lasting impact on my physical energy for the rest of the day. Should I throw the thought of indulgence out of my mind? Should I just indulge a little? I have no idea at this point",

    "17 year old forced to stop Paxil 20mg cold turkey. Looking for Advice! I was very recently diagnosed with borderline personality disorder as well as anxiety, anxiety related insomnia, and severe depression from the previous improper diagnosis of Bipolar ii, and I was taking Paxil 20mg for 2 months. After my third change of psychiatrist, I was instructed to stop Paxil cold turkey in favor of staring prozac in 2 weeks because of the risks associated with adolescents taking Paxil. He is adamant on me stopping as soon as possible and I do understand why this is important, for the drug is still not FDA approved for treating depression in teens even though it is commonly used for it. I am currently 3 days in, and I am experiencing the full force of the withdrawals Severe headaches and zaps, cold sweats, strange dreams and waking up in sweats, equilibrium and balance issues, tingling of extremities and numbness in hands, lightheadedness, suicidal ideation, dissociation, severe mood swings and racing thoughts. As someone very new to all of this and the processes associated with treatment, Id really appreciate anything, and I mean anything, anyone has to say about their personal experiences with withdrawals from Paxil or any antidepressant for that matter as well as any tips for managing this hell for the next 2 weeks. Thankfully, I am not currently enrolled in high school, so i am not forced to deal with this while stuck in class, but its challenging to go through this seemingly alone without contact from others. Appreciate any feedback or thoughts I can get.",

Ive always tought Im usless. I think that I have depression from 12 or 13 years old. Im feel alone... I feel fat, ugly, alone. I was bullied at school for years. I think that I hate myself. I live with my parents. my mom has a respiratory disease an my dad is alcoholic. With the passage of time, I have lost all my interests, from music I play guitar, computers, video games, reading. etc. I have been single for 1 year in a relationship of 2 months.

I really just want to be able to feel nothing, more out of convenience for my own and everyone elses sake. I do really want to kill myself but I would never do it cause I know that it can fuck up those around you and I know what a persons death can do to people.

And just when I had slowly recovered from it, a family member on hearing what exactly happened made a remark that I think hes better than you, for the family which means that I am too impulsive and rude and emotional and is bound to create problems in a family. I still havent recovered from that. I didnt want to cry, because my uncle and I dont exactly see eye to eye and I wanted to disregard this remark and get going with my day. BUT i began to tear up the next second. I cried for hours. I hated myself. Do i wish to be rude? no. Am I this emotional by choice? no. Do feel crying is the solution to all my problems? no. And my family thinks otherwise for all the above questions I want to seek professional help. Having been wanting to for three years now. But heres the thing. I am from India. I am still in college. I live with my family and they provide for me. They will never accept depression as real and a therapist is a big NO. I can never open up to them about this and I cant secretly visit one, nor can I afford it myself. I am writing here because I want to change this.

Ive been dealing with depressionanxiety since I was 1213. It comes with just a long story that I was never able to overcome it. I tried to seek help and when she tried to suggest medication since I was already angry I just never went back. I just got to a point where I just say Im ok when asked HOW ARE YOU? Its just easier to say Im ok, than explaining how I feel. night time is the worst for me since Im alone in my room. Ive tried to text people that I was once able to do, but that turned out wrong for me so I guess I dont have that option anymore. Ive done things in the past where I am trying to avoid but as selfish as that may sound to others I found my comfort in that. I dont want to do that anymore. Finally admitted to myself that I cannot do this anymore by myself. This whole year has been a night mare for me but I still tried and I feel like kept falling deeper and deeper. Like being in a coma but with my eyes open. Like being in a crowded room and yet Im still feeling alone, boxed in, no way out. Ive become so afraid of being alone, that I am alone. Lost valuable friends, a great partner and I cannot get any of it back. I held back on telling people how I feel with the fear of losing anyone else.

He then responded, Oi calm down. Too where I got more mad calling him out for the crap hes been doing, only to get the response, Cringe. We eventually got into a call around the same time, too where he said that he didnt care about me and he ghosted me because he felt like it. A few months later, some of my friends wanted to inv him to a discord server, I was a little not that into it, but I felt that maybe he would be more mature and would be my friend again or smth dumb like that. After my friends had messaged him, he messaged me, Cringe. I asked him, Dude what the hell. Too where he said, Yknw its been a few months, I used too think that you were just a joke or a little game, but now your weird and kinda cringe. Then blocking me.

I have 3 kids I grew up in a toxic family mom and dad divorced, seen my dad get locked up a lot my mom never being around because she worked so much. I always wanted my kids to have a better life than me, you know the American dream mom and dad that stayed together. I didnt want them becoming a statistic, I guess the toxic thing never went away. My husband and I have known each other since 1999, his dad died in March of 99 and my dad April of 98 we did a lot of stupid shit drugs and staying drunk and all kinds of dumb stuff. We broke up right after he turned 21 because he didnt want me in his life, I caught him cheating. Well a drunken booty call in October I ended up pregnant, I was happy and we  tried  to work it out, he left me high and dry for most of my pregnancy and the first 2 years of our sons life. Toxic family told him I was sleeping with everything that had a penis so our son wasnt his, his mom paid for a paternity test came back he is 99.9999999 the father  duh I knew that. Stupid me went back again to him, we moved in together he lied to me every chance we are very toxic for each other. We got married in 2006 had a kid 2007, from 2007 till 20112012 something like that he cheated again and made me feel like it was my fault, he lied to me about everything! But he promised hed be better and he was always sooo very sorry. Fast Forward a couple years his best friends dad died when I was going to leave him and take the kids, he begged me to stay I stayed. We hand another kid 2015 so I figured that was a sign telling me to stay things would get better.

Its almost like he just doesnt want to. In fact he has said on multiple occasions that he doesnt want to get better. It all started when we had a termination for many different health reasons on my part. That was a good 6 months ago now. I went straight back to work afterward and he just didnt. All he is doing is burying his head in video games, he doesnt leave the house, doesnt help around the house or anything. We have been trying to get him to see someone and he just flat out refuses. He self medicates as well and I dont think that is helping at all, in fact I think it maybe contributing to the problem. But anytime anyone brings it up he just says that it isnt a problem. He did start to take some antidepressants but has decided that he isnt going to take them anymore. I know we cant force him to get help but he needs to do something. I have been trying to support him by giving him space and letting him do his own thing, but that just doesnt seem to be working. I just dont know what to do anymore. I am scared to bring any of this up to him as he just gets very defensive and nasty towards me just to clarify its not physical its just hurtful. Need some advice on what I can do to help.",

    "Im not sure If Im depressed or if i’m just sad. Pls help Im writing this while sitting on my floor next to my bed in front of my vent because its the place I feel calmest right now. Ive been trying to figure out for a really long time if im actually depressed or if its just because its so popularized now and that its just how everyone feels. I dont have prolonged sadness and I dont feel it every second but some days are terrible. Both my mother and sister have depression and have had it all their lives. I used to go to counseling for anxiety in like 5th and 6th grade but I stopped because I started to feel better again but the first winter of 7th grade I got really sad and I was told it was just seasonal which it was for about 3 years. When the winter of my sophomore year came it was different because I was always sad but didnt know why. I tried to find reasons but I could so I decided not to go to therapy or something like that. and now summer going into my senior year and I just feel empty. The seasonal sadness never left after that year and I find myself all the time just feeling blank. I dont really have good thoughts anymore and Ive turned into kind of a pessimist which sucks to say. Im afraid to talk to anyone in person about it besides my mom because people just say im soft or weak. Im just trying to figure out if its just me being brainwashed by social media into thinking im sad or if Im actually depressed. Please help me.",
    "I'm losing my mind and need help. I contemplate suicide everyday. I don't see any future anymore, just think I'll kill myself one of these days. I need help. 17 year old male, 18 beginning of July. Ive been struggling with my mental health for all of my life, and it got worse after starting puberty. Ive always been terrible with social groups and interactions. Never managed to make a lot of friends, and those I did never sticked. Had some of your regular trauma from parents and older brother. Ive always felt alone. When I became a teenager I started with the depression. Got very bad episodes, where I would shut down, and fake illness so I could stay home. I missed one month of school once, and on a trip to Italy for school I faked illness for two weeks so I could stay in bed, and could only think about jumping off a bridge. As I got deeper into adolescence not only did my mental health deteriorate, but my ability too. My memory became poor, and my focus was gone, always having mental fog. I couldnt remember words, and speak eloquently. Math ability went to the shitter, always making stupid mistakes that would then seem retarded later. My IQ seemed to have dropped as much as 10 points, since I have periodically been applied tests and only perform worse. Starting high school made me much more suicidal because of this, and the isolation of not knowing anyone, and the people I did know wouldnt even look me in the eyes. I had already gone to a psychologist, and after that a neurologist, and recently a therapist. Got medication, and have been on it since 2017. The doctor has changed my meds more times than I can count, and none of them have helped. She told me that I would probably never be off of meds, but they still dont help me. I have no cure. I feel I have been slowly getting worse, going down my own dark little hole. Ive always been obsessive, but now it feels like its all I am. I feel like Im losing my mind. Everything makes me irritated, or break down.",
    "Was made fun of for not being circumcised :( I was talking with other people about different inventions from people and someone mentioned that Jewish people invented circumcision.

It gets worse when I really dont do anything but this feeling kinda forces me to do so. And then I start feeling guilty about not doing anything. I always ask myself what can I do so I can feel better? and my brain is looking for answers but I cant find any! Because nothing makes fun or I just cant get motivated because everything feels so dark.. Any advices?",
    "I dont know what to do anymore Hey, Im feeling really bad for a pretty long time, I think it all started about 2 and 12 years ago. Back then it wasnt as dramatic as now, I think of suicide for half a year straight. I dont go to a therapist because I gotta take my parents with me and theyre a big part of my situation. I just feel so worthless and that no one likes me. Most of my classmates have lost their virginity or at least kissed a girl and im almost 16 and never had anything like this. I have basically no friends and the person I always talke with is annoyed by me, and thats not something my anxiety tells me. As I said earlier my parents are a big part of my mental state, they often beat me in the past which pretty much fucked me up and now Im like this cant make friends, antisocial and depressed. And now I really dont know what to do anymore, theres really no one I wanna life for but im too much of a pussy to kill myself so Im here, not willing to do anything but still here. I think I just need some lifting words that motivate me to be brave and keep on going. Sorry for my poor English, Im from germany so its not my mother tongue.",
    "Relationship possibly costing me my mental health Hopefully I dont go too long with ranting and what not so Ill try to keep it short. My GF and I have been in an onoff relationship for 7 years and have been together since highschool. 25M24F. Last summer she broke up with me over because she wanted to experience other things which she didnt come up front and said that I just figured. It was an extremely rough month for me after that but slowly got over it. Few months later Over the holidays she decides to try and come back into my life. I tried not to sleep with her for a bit since I knew thats what she wanted at first. Now were back together but I found out that she slept with what was a close friend over the break up. She also was dating someone off tinder for majority of the break up and all of this is just really fucking me up. I really love this girl and I am trying to move forward since she claims that she loves me and wants to have a future with me. I want all of that as well, its only been a month since were trying to work things out again but there are days like these where I dont know if I could let this go. I want to so bad and recently Ive been losing myself over this whole situation. I dont know who I am anymore. I feel so many emotions when I get caught up thinking about all the shit she did during the break up. Anyone have any suggestions or advice on this? Please. All is appreciated.

    "I don’t understand the point in living I thought I had it figured out with religion. But religion ended up being just another idol that failed me. Now I feel even more lost than before. I cant seem to wrap my mind around suffering. I cant understand why we seem to be in this universe just to suffer and die. Maybe others find enjoyment in life, but I cant seem to get any. If were just supposed to toil and work to nourish ourselves only to continue to toil and work until we die, why delay our inevitable death? Why not just commit suicide?

    "Soon to be dad and I’m struggling to cope So Ive written posts about this before but heres the basics. My pregnant girlfriend split up with me. She said she dident love me anymore. I lost my temper and said some things I shouldnt have which I admit was my fault. We dident talk or have any contact for 6 weeks I drunk heavily during this time and my depression was unbearable. I eventually reached out and apologised and explained I wanted to be there for the baby. She agrees I meet her for the first time since we broke up and she makes it clear she never wants to get back together and just wants to be friends. So since then Ive cut right back on my drinking intact I dont drink anymore. As the son of a alcoholic looser father I dont want that for my child I want to be a good dad. Anyway every time I talk to her it feels like a kick in the teeth. So I actively avoid messaging her and only respond to her when she messages me cause of all the pain it brings up. The only thing keeping me going is the baby. But its been 10 weeks since we broke up and I still feel just as broken and miserable inside. I dont have any friends I sit on my PlayStation all day just trying to zone out and focus on something other than how miserable I am. I thought that when I stopped drinking I would feel better and to be honest I dont I still feel like shit. I have a therapist whos helpful and a support worker to help me not go back to drinking. But it doesnt help much and to be honest I just dont know what to do anymore.",
    "Does anyone else totally disassociate when they're drunk? Okay, so I know that alcohol is a depressant and that it usually doesnt mix well when youre already depressed, but I wouldnt think a response to it would ever be consistently this bad. Long story short, went out for a few drinks with some work friends to celebrate my last day and the new job that I got. It was fun, these are people I like, and things were starting to get a bit better for me. Took 173 applications but I finally got a salaried gig, finally established a group of friends for myself after moving to a new city in a pandemic, found an advisor for my masters thesis. But at a certain point, maybe one or two beers past where I should have stopped, I just wasnt there. I left, didnt say goodbye to anyone, attempted to bike home, and cried on the side of the road after falling off my bike. Im usually a little bit of an emotional drunk, but I mostly just get affectionate and want to make sure my friends know that I love them. Its never been this, Ive never felt this outside of my own experience. Thoughts?",
    "How can I (28f) help my Mum (56f) who is depressed and considering suicide. I also offered to attend with her if she would like she took this offer as an insult that she needed supervision. Offering to help her write a resume and cover letter for job applications. Last night she called me in such a state that I drive to her home in the middle of the night from 5 hours away because I was sure she was going to harm herself and the local police station was unmanned for the weekend and I was advised that meant they couldnt complete a welfare check until Monday morning. I am terrified that she is making an active plan to end her life and that if she attempts it she will probably succeed the local ambulance response time is a joke and the nearest hospital is over an hour away. I have successfully helped her move through depressive episodes multiple times before but this is different. Both my sister and I am at our wits end and have no idea what else we can be doing or where to turn to. What more can we be doing? TLDR My Mum is depressed and highly likely to be suicidal.

    "Severe seasonal affective disorder I 28M live in Canada and Ive had SAD since ive ever known. Was originally born in a very warm country and migrated here when I was 6. In the summers, I feel so fucking amazing. Any obstacle thrown at me I have no issue combating and honestly fear no issue. My eyes are lit up awake every waking hour, I sleep well and even if i get 5 hours of sleep. Its fine and I keep pushing forward. However in winter, its the exact opposite. I feel like crying when a small problem occurs at work, my brain feels frozen and i cant even concentrate on a show even if Ive slept a full 8 hours. Sometimes i feel like I cant breathe. I do take 2000 iu of vitamin D as recommended by my doc but doesnt seem to help. But, if there is a bright sunny day like today, I feel great again. Because of this, it feels like I continously move forward in summer and my relationships with people are great. However i take steps back every winter so my relationships and friendships always take a hit. Also because of this its hard for me to advance in my career as well as I have a hard time remembering anything or staying focused in the winter. My SAD gets so bad that thoughts of suicide enters my mind in the winter. How do I deal with this? Ive even tried microdosing shrooms for work but doesnt help. I need real help please, this endless circle makes me really upset. I want to continue advancing my life without constantly taking leaps backwards every winter.",
    "I am beyond Pissed of spiraling out of control and need someone to help sort me. I felt like maybe I was growing in the last 6 months. I made a group of friends I could talk to for the first time. A group that would hang out all the time have a great time and just do everything together. About 2 months in I opened up to one of them after having really bad day. They said I could always trust them and they wouldnt leave me. Here I am a few months later and they call saying that they cant come and talk to me ever when I need it. I told them I was overwhelming as a person because Im so depressed and negative and that they would want to be done and they would stop coming over when I needed help. I was told however dont worry I wont ever leave you alone but as I had expected I was right and now they are giving up. I am beyond angered and sad and frustrated that I put all of my trust 100 into this person who even has told me to open up to the rest of that group. But now the whole group has a slight fear of me because depression is scary even for people who arent actually depressed because they just dont know what to do sometimes. I am no longer treated the same by the rest of the group and the one I trusted with everything has left me in complete shambles and my mind is freaking out. I am not really sure how to deal with this stuff because I dont have much time to do things or the energy to do much for myself. Any suggestions on how to sort my head or at the very least I dont know just acknowledging that Im doomed as always would be great. Or just you know the whole yeah people suck nobody can be trusted everyone lies and nobody could ever handle the worthless person you are. Because thats what my head tells me right now.",
    "Is anyone in the same position as me? Hey this might be long but oh welll we all love a stranger that overshares and details their whole life out on the internet. Ok so I think Im depressed. Im lethargic, Im apathetic, Im never happy, but never sad either. I always feel like this crazy heavy weight on my chest like loneliness. I feel just so lonely in this world. And I have friends. I have very close friends and an ex girlfriend I get on very well with. But I just feel like Im everyones second choice. Im a really likeable guy. I havent found a single person who has any problem with me. Like everyone likes me. But I feel like no one truly loves me. My main thing is that I hate normalcy. I hate this feeling of okay. Yet thats what my whole life is right now. Im fairly good looking, Im not poor, Im not rich. Theres nothing special about my life. And thats what I hate. Im scared my future is me withering away into mediocrity. Id rather be sad than how I am now because at least thats something. I feel like Im depressed but at the same time I dont. I dont hate myself If anything Im narcissistic, I have a very high self esteem Depressed people usually hate themselves. I dont cut, I dont cry, I dont ever really have a mad breakdown. I always think about how Id kill myself but I know deep down Id never actually do it. Im none of that. But Im not happy either. Also, I lie a lot. I manipulate people close to me so I can get ahead. I always put myself first. Before anyone. Machiavellianism. Then again, I dont know if Im just exaggerating that to try seem edgy or different. Which I so crave to be. I dont know.

Everything good ive ever had in life including that job, and basically all other jobs ive had is pretty much because of my dad and my last name. All of my friends who started off with so much less and dealt with more pressing issues in life went on to do so much more. I feel pretty much hopeless in finding something that i really want to do or because im not like them. Im definitely not the smart one or the good looking one or the outgoingfunny one. Im the only one whose never really had a girlfriend. Im pretty much just the rich one who at the time was a pity friend of a few guys i knew my entire life and grew up with but a lot of the people I came across in both high school and college never really liked me, not because i was an ass im relatively quiet, but because i never fit into a lot of those circles because of this or that yet because my childhood friends were friends with those guys, i was kind of just a fringe guy to them and still am now that im home. Sometimes i think i put myself in the wrong groups of people in life because i didnt have the social skills to find my own. This whole idea of me not being good at anything worthwhile has really carried into my early adult life. Its to a point now where im afraid of failure more than anything. Im afraid of a lot. Ive been feeling depressed off and on since about July on this go around. I get discouraged probably way too easily. I also feel like a disappointment. Im afraid of telling people that im depressed or that i have struggled with depression in the past. It would disappoint my parents because theyve given me so much. It makes me feel pathetic that im depressed because of everything i was born into. Sometimes i would fight the notion that what i was feeling was actually depression given my situation, but that was always redirected to me just being soft or a pussy in my mind that made me feel even worse. Sympathy always makes me feel guilty, really no matter what its about.",

So long story short, my grandma is an alcoholic, shes depressed, and shes revealed to me today that she wishes she was dead all the time. Shes tried for a long time these help herself, to get out of her addiction to alcohol and cigarettes, but she really cant do it herself. She fell today and has multiple times before after drinking heavily, and it took a while to get her back up due to her obesity. This was when she told me she wishes she was dead.

I know that to have suicidal thoughts, you arent thinking clearly by definition. I didnt explain that to her though.

And since then i tried to be more active, got a bike thanks to a job with my aunt and started walking for playing pokemon go again etc. But whenever i stop those activities i feel very low and sad, even if i do it just because im busy, but i have to admit sometimes i feel very lazy and tired to do them.

Katie told me the other girl she was with said that is just disrespectful and out of line. and Amy said, Im glad I know how she really feels about me. Sorry for the long story but now, I just feel like nothing. I feel that I mess up every friendship. But at the same time, I am frustrated with the fact that if they do anything to hurt me, it means nothing, but if I do anything I am automatically this horrible human being. They act as if they have done nothing to me. I left my group message with all my friends, which was my main source of support and I stopped talking to the boy who finally told me he has lost all romantic feelings for me. He talked to me every day for about a month after he ended things and said he still had feelings for me for the longest time. I feel so alone and like I have hit rock bottom once again. I feel suicidal but I know myself enough to know I wont do anything. I dont want to die I want the pain and hurt to stop. I just wish people would care for me the amount I care for them. I wish people actually understand that they hurt me and, not to be selfcentered, but put themselves in my shoes for just a second.",
    "FIRE!!! I cant take anymore stress. Anymore loss. Ive had enough. Ive fallen so deep into a depression that Ive completely let myself go. And I mean completely. I barely have the energy or drive to crawl out of bed. There is no function in my life anymore, Im simply existing. I am pretty much alone now. Ive lost everything. I have had nonstop loss and stress since June of 2018 and its not letting up. Im at the point now to where if Im lucky enough to sleep, Ill wake, up wondering who in my life is going to die that day or what terrible thing is going to happen. ats what it feels like. Like Im outside of myself watching The last straw was the breakup of my 9 year live in relationship. He came home from work and dumped me out of the blue. He moved out 3 days later, leaving me with our large rental house, its utilities and other bills. We split everything and Ive had to take over his share. My elderly mom lives here with me and her income helps but she is ill and is now developing either Dementia or early Alzheimers. I loved my ex so much and his loss alone has nearly put me under. Its been 9 mos since he walked and I found out he had been cheating online. Well thats over and now he has a new girlfriend, my worst nightmare was the day I was going to have to see that. She has money and I really think thats the only reason why hes with her, which is sad. We have stayed in touch mostly by text and he sees our animals we owned together. Now that he has her he no longer wants to see all of our animals and doesnt want to talk to me. He told me it hurts him to talk to me. Yeah right!!! I may be severely depressed but Im not stupid. Add the Covid stress to everything Ive had to deal with and I feel like Im losing it. Ive never gone this long without a shower. Ive never gone days at a time without sleep. Sometimes Ill go 4 days without eating. God help me.",
    "How am I supposed to get help when no one will listen? Im in my late 20s and life has constantly taken a dump on me, I need to talk to a therapist, everything in life feels meaningless, nothing is fun anymore, and I cant take it. I came really close a few times in the spring to just ending it and realized I needed to get help. Talking with my friends didnt help, which is fair, theyre not professionals, but when I talked to my doctor he also kinda brushed off my concerns and gave me a referral to a therapist. I tried calling their offices multiple times but no one answered the phone or replied to the messages I left. Tried again with a different therapist but the same thing happened. I know my phone works and at this point I feel like the universe is just trying to tell me to kill myself, the only reason I havent is because I dont want to make my friends and family sad. What should I do here? I feel like trying again is just going to lead to failure and make feel worse, again. I wrote a few paragraphs about my situation but cut out all but the most relevant stuff, I can provide more info if needed, Im really just at a loss and dont know how much longer I can go on when everything seems to keep going wrong and I have so little to be proud of.",

    "I think I might have depression Hey guys, 13 m here. So Lately i have been feeling like the things I do for fun arent fun anymore. I am a casual gamer and have a lot of LEGO, but now, anytime I start playing a game or playing with my lego, I get bored fast, and not like oh Ill just find something else to do bored, its constant and I always feel tired. Even when I watch YouTube, the creators I watch get boring and it makes me feel like Im wasting time. I used to spend hours a day playing Minecraft, GoW, SpiderMan, or FortniteIm sorry, so this feels really weird and makes me sad. Sometimes I feel like crying, but nothing comes out and I just dont understand why. I was trying to find out why I feel this way and I looked on google and it said I might have depression. Do I?

    "It’s like I’m not allowed to feel this way Recently, my depression symptoms have been worse. My mom brought me to the doctor and because Im too afraid to open up, my trash doctor thinks Im faking so he told me to smile more and think positive.

My job closed back at the start of the pandemic. I was off work for almost a year and a half. Things were actually starting to look up the last few weeksmonths. I was slowly becoming productive again. Getting closer ot feeling normal. I was actually making progress on my portfolio and studying, to get a job that I dont hate. But my job opened up again last week. Its been 3 days. And already, it feels as though Ive spiralled all the way back down to exactly where I was before. It feels as though this horrible dark cloud is hanging over me again. I feel permantently exhausted. Too tired and on edge to get on with anything. Everything just feels like this big, anxious bad dream, slowly counting down to when Im next working. I just feel a constant dread, waiting for the next shift. I hate my job. I hate the people I work with. I hate my customers. I dont know how to stop feeling like this. But I need to if I ever want to get out of this job. I need to be focused. I need to be able to focus on getting this portfolio done. I need to focus on picking up these qualifications that I need. I need to be able to focus on studying.

    "I just need some advice about my new psychiatrist, I am shocked Ill try to be as brief as possible I was diagnosed with depression around five years ago, when I was only 17, after I tried to commit suicide. As a consequence, I started seeing a therapist while also taking medications. And I actually saw some improvements. However, Everything went downhill Two years ago, when my mother passed away. She was the person I loved the most in the world, and the only one who never made me feel guilty about my problems, so because I am dumb as fuck I just disappeared, never contacted my therapists again, stopped my medications, and moved to London while also taking drugs and leading a very wild life until I almost killed myself. I have now come home for nearly one year, and I made the hard decision of starting therapy again. Last week I went to see a psychiatrist that a friend of mine suggested me to see. After he asked me a few questions whose answers I am not sure he understood since he kept interrupting me, he told me, Listen to me, kid, you are not sick, or depressed, look at yourself, you are all pretty and dolled up, you are probably just sad because your mum died, you simply need to toughen up and get over it, and youll be fine I Was shocked. I left his office crying, and now I am totally at a loss. Should I give up on therapy? Should I see thiS guy again and give him a second chance? I dont know what to do.. maybe I am just destined to be miserable.",
    "What if my depression isn’t lying to me? They say depression lies. That Im not a terrible person or worthless or ugly or stupid. That the world is too screwed up to save. But what if depression is the only one telling the truth? I dont want it to be true. But Ive had so many disappointments, so many failures. And the world is so terrible. People are terrible and selfish. How do we know that depression ISNT lying, about me and the world? I feel so insignificant and meaningless and I dont really think anyone would really miss me. Im not going to hurt myself because I cant do that to my kids. But they deserve so much better than me.",
    "Just found out the girl I’ve speaking to the last 7 years is talking to someone else. Need some advice please. Hi, Throw away account just cause I dont feel real comfortable posting this on my main account. Also excuse the formatting If its not correct, and the length. Im a 26 year old male whos had a thing for their best friend I know right for the last 7 years known her for 14 years and I only just found out tonight that the reason shes been ignoring me for the last week is because shes speaking to another male. Shes known Ive had the feelings for her for the last 7 years and she always tells me she doesnt feel the same way. Weve had so many arguments over some real stupid shit like her blocking me on social media when she goes out so I dont see any photos of her with guys because she knows I get real upset about it. Every time we have the conversation of my feelings I always ask her to be honest with me and tell me if shes talking to someone, because itll hurt me less coming from her rather than me finding out the hard way, and she always tells me no. The last time we had this conversation was 2 weeks ago. Fast forward to tonight, I had a mutual friend come over who I havent seen in around 2 years who asked me if I still have feelings for her. Me not wanting to show my emotions said I dont, so she then followed by saying oh my god can you believe shes talking to name. I was like wtf are you talking about? She then began to tell me how she has been talking to our mutual friends friend for the last 23 months. She then began to show me all these photos and messages that the mutual has shown her, so I got to see everything with my own eyes. I always had a feeling she was hiding something from me but I always got the answer no from her so I always ignored. Shes my best friend, shes literally the reason Im still alive. Ive been through hell and back with her, and I value her friendship so much that I can get through all the suffering and pain I have when shes around just so I can spend some time with her, but all she does when she comes over is sit on her phone for hours and just smiles at it.",

    "How to tell my friends that I’ve been having suicidal thoughts? Trigger warning suicide 19F This has been one of the lowest points of my life. I wont go into details as to what is making me so depressed, but I realize that I really should talk about this with someone. For a while about a week, I was actually set on committing suicide. I started planning it out in my head, was even planning out letters to write to everyone, but a part of me knew that this was the wrong decision. Even now, Im about 5050 on it. At this current moment my mind is more clear, so I just know that I should really tell my friends and get help before it gets to a point where I actually go through on it and start overthinking it again. I have 4 very close friends. Weve been through a lot together and mental health is something we all take very seriously. While I am planning on seeing a counsellor, I just really need someone close to me to know what Ive been going through.

He doesnt want to go back to counseling even with a different counselor and we have talked to his Dr who wants him to try using some strategiescopinglife changes. He is kinda willing to go through a book with me and asks why he should go to a counselor because he can talk to me, doesnt know a counselor well enough to trust them, his past counselor didnt help, and in general dismisses all my answers that include they are professionals, counseling has helped me, counselors can be trusted, we can interview a couple different therapists, science backs counseling etc. Help me find a not cheesey workbook, toolkit book, etc for us to go through. Ideally one that would be good for a teen. Hes not super on board with improving sleep, etc so if a book gives good logic hed be more open to it than me or his Dr suggesting it.

I would like to balance out my poor eating habits since Im living off of the cheapest things i can afford ramen, chef boyardee, you get the picture with more physical fitness. I have a few medical problems that prevent me from being as active as Id like. A few years ago i had an accident and broke my spine so i have hardware implanted and a bum hip. Even taking a six hour shift at work leaves me all but unable to walk the next day. Ive started taking walks, and since i live in a rough part of an inner city its difficult to be by myself and not have someone harrass me or follow me. I cant afford a gym membership so i was wondering if anyone had tips or suggestions on how i can do more from my home. If it matters Id like to focus on my stomach and love handles, its just hard because of my back and hip problems to do a bunch of situps and pushups and leg lifts. Does anyone know how to do these to reduce my pain so i can keep going longer for better results? My body image issues are really starting to affect me, and they havent before...

    "How do I forgive myself? 7 years ago I met this amazing girl on Instagram when we were both 13. She lived in Ohio and I was from Massachusetts. We talked as friends and grew into a relationship.

So far I have only had good experiences with advices on reddit, so I decided to post my problem here. Everything written below should try to make my current situation a little more understandable and not to arouse pity or something like that. Thanks  ampx200B ampx200B Hi, Im almost 18 years old, and Im trying to briefly summarize my life as fast as possible. ampx200B Ive been bullied at school since I was around 9 years old fourth grade. It got a little less in eighth grade, but most of the people at school still left me out. had about 2 relatively good friends. At the same time about 1415 years old I started drinking. I came to school drunk about 23 times a week and drank now and then on weekends. Mostly I drank alone. I hated going to school because of the other students and tried to make my time there a little nicer. At the same time I got to know a very good friend to whom I could open up for the first time because she also had to struggle with bullying and depression. However, I fell deeply in love with her but never told her and always pretended I just wanted to be friends with her because she was my only good friend and I didnt want to lose her. I became emotionally dependent on her. After a little over 2 years she began to feel that I felt for her she had a boyfriend at the time. We fell out and she cut off contact with me. I was devastated for months, unable to concentrate on work and just plain desperate. It was two years ago and I still have to think about her quite a lot. ampx200B In the period between 14 years old eighth grade and now almost 18 a lot more things happened.",
    "I've been alone for so long I think I'm losing communication skills I felt like I resembled a corpse because of how dead inside I really started to become, and even became more and more obsessed with death and wanting to be dead. Now that Ive been shy and lonely for so long when I actually try to talk to people I have a hard time forming the appropriate sentence to match what the person had said to me. Or I might form the sentence awkwardly making my point much harder to come across to them. I feel like I have to stop and really put together a sentence in my head before I can say it or else itll just not make any sense when the person Im talking to finally hears my response. Or Ill hesitate while talking and then itll mess up the flow of what I was talking about and I cant piece back together the sentence I was trying to say. Ive slowly became more and more self aware at how many times Ive had to just completely scrape a sentence midway through because of this hesitation while trying to speak, people probably think Im crazy by now. I have nothing interesting to tell people either so when Im at work and the person whos talking to me shares a story about them that happened recently I feel like Im not given back to the conversation because I have no story at all other than depressing stories to share in the conversation, so 910 times Im simply forced to only comment about their story instead of sharing my own stories. Otherwise I dont talk at all, not unless someone else starts up a conversation with me. I kinda dont even like talking to people anymore because it just feels like its getting really difficult to make a conversion work when Im a part of it. Only being able to reply to their experiences instead of giving them insight on my own personal experiences. I also have a extremely difficult time looking people in their eyes for more than a second, maintaining eye contact just feels really uncomfortable. I feel so much pressure from other people too, like if I drop something I instantly feel like everyone is watching me as I pick it back up.

    "Can SSRIs worsen creativity/interest in arts/music? Hi, not sure where to post this. Ive been making music since I was 7, and I come from a traumatic background. In bad times, Ive often turned to music to help me deal with the negative feelings and it has been constructive most of the time. My mental health got worse through high school and college as a result of constantly repressing my trauma and trying to push through with sheer willpower and stubbornness. My life is a wreck as a result Ill spare the details, but I now have no college degree and havent held a reliable job in almost three years now. I kept up music through those hard times, and the last song I wrotereleased was in August of 2019. Around the same time, my psychiatrist diagnosed me with OCD and I switched from Prozac to Zoloft both SSRIs which Im currently on. The OCD has improved somewhat, but I cant bring myself to play my instruments since that month and I dont know why. Even when I listen to music on Spotify, which I used to do for hours per day by choiceenjoyment, it feels like I just hear noise now the patterns that I know I could recognize by ear before feel arbitrary and I lose interest before it can even form. Im doing introspection with my therapist and trying to get to the root of this problem, and Im sure there are environmental factorslife events that have contributed to this as well. Is this a common side effect for musiciansartists on antidepressants? Its hard to find anything written on the matter online.",

Im having a hard time describing this. Its like...total numbness except for the breakdowns sometimes, no will to do anything, even if I try to do something, my brain is having a hard time comprehending anything. I could and would rather sleep all day, every day. Its a bit unnerving, like Im not even alive anymore. So...if any of you were ever in this situation, what helped? Did you ever find a motivation? Or did you eventually just got yourself to therapy and went through the motions and it worked? Or...what the heck do I do?",
    "What do you do when everything makes you depressed? I literally cannot do anything anymore without becoming sad while doing it. I hate my job so that makes me depressed, I go to the gym everyday but I always end up hating myself by then end because everyone there is more attractive and fitter then me and ill always be ugly and fat and no one will love me, I go home to do homework and I end up depressed because I hate school, then I try to take my mind off things by playing a video game, watching a movie, or listening to music but even then I become depressed because I start to think about what a piece off garbage I am because I could never create anything like the things im enjoying. I cant hang out with my friends because eventually, they piss me off because while I love them to death, they can become very annoying and make me angry. I cant really meet new people because I am so afraid that people will not like me that I do not even try, which also screws up my dating life as well. But because of this isolation I put myself through, im very lonely. I used to hang out with a girl that did not make me sad but we are not on good terms anymore so I really have nothing to get me through the days anymore. The only thing keeping me from ending my life is that I do not want my death to be a burden on others, it feels selfish. I really do not know what to do anymore that can make me happy and it scares me so if anyone has any advice of any kind, I will take whatever you got.",
    "why do I feel a void, or a hole in my chest? Disclaimer I am sorry if this post doesnt fit, but Ive tried posting elsewhere and havent gotten help. I have not been diagnosed with depression nor have I felt as if I did before. To start, I watched this video on YouTube after scrolling through my recommendations for a bit. httpsyoutu.bemB_0FXiFHd0 To be honest, I thought it was pretty sad, and it spoke to me in a way Ive never felt. Afterwards, I began to feel an emotional hole in my chest, or, a void. Im not sure what feeling this video triggered, but its happened to me only a few times before, and its never been this bad. Going on 6 days now, whenever i think of the girl in the video, I think of the song and what she went through. I feel it. It doesnt matter where I am, what I am doing, or who Im with. Ive also began to feel less motivated to do things in my pastime. As a naive junior in hs, Im really not sure what to make of all this. Help would be much appreciated. TLDR why do things make me feel a void in my chest?",

    "At 43 (M), depression is new to me and I don't know how to handle it. But once my wife had something with friends that didnt involve me, I realized that I have nothing but her. I have no friends here, and havent seen my coworkers facetoface since early 2020. Ive met my wifes coworkers and have even been to a lunch with one or two of them and really enjoyed it. But for some reason, theyve lately wanted to do the girls dinner thing. My wife knows Im down a bit. She doesnt really know the extent. Im not suicidal, but I wouldnt mind not waking up one morning. I cant tell her that because a I dont want her to feel like its her fault and b shes very prone to depression herself, and the last thing I want is to spur her into a bout of it. Having said that, I keep playing one thing in my mind and Im worried its going to make me resentful If the roles were reversed... say in 2019 when she was really depressed about our new situation, and some coworkers wanted to meet up for dinner with me, I wouldnt even THINK about doing it without her. Hey honey! I know youre crying because you hate your job and are questioning life, but Im gonna go eat with the boys. Like... I cant even IMAGINE that thought process. Either way, Im constantly on the verge of either sleeping or crying and I tried reaching out to a therapist in my network that Ive spoken to before when this working from home stuff started bothering me and no one even has video appts. available until July. Then again, I dont even know that therapy works for me.",
    "Any other depressed mental health professionals out there? Im wondering if theres anyone here who can relate... I am on my doctoral internship which, is my last step towards getting my doctorate in clinical psychology. I had to move 1000 miles to start my internship which is obviously stressful because Im away from everything familiar and my support system. And its stressful because Im stepping into new role working 40 hours a week as a professional, rather than being a student and working part time. And my anxiety has affected my work. And the more my supervisors have provided what was intended to be constructive criticism the more I have felt like a worthless piece of s. And the more Ive messed up, the worse their criticism has gotten. And now my supervisors want to meet with me next week. Pretty sure Im going to be put into some kind of remediation. Or fired. And I feel like such a worthless failure I dont think I can make it through this year. And I cant help but think that my life is over, and I should just be done with this. My 8 years of education in psychology and hundreds of hours of therapy have not helped me get away from the feeling that I am worthless as a human being. I know where it comes from, but that doesnt solve things. I cant use cognitive restructuring to think myself out of how I am feeling. I have tried and Ive tried and I dont know if I can do it anymore. Sometimes I think Im going to be OK, I think I can pull myself out of this. But wondering if theres anyone out there who can also understand what its like to understand themselves on an intellectual level but still feel completely unable to fix their selfdestructive behavior? Any therapists who can pay attention to their patients needs and then be unable to meet their own, or who wonder how they can help clients when their clients are more healthy than they are?",
    "I'm at my end point. I feel so alone and like no one cares about me, I have no one to turn to for reassurance or comfort in these very difficult times. Other people have friends and family but I have no one. Suicide phone lines dont help me one bit and besides, Ive called too much at this point and I consider myself a nuisance to them. Ive attempted to make friends but I always ruin it or theyre not interested and ghost me, let me tell you, being thosed or ignored is one of the worst feelings when youre lonely and trying to reach out for that human connection. I dont know whats wrong with my generation or society as a whole, it seems empathy has gone out of fashion with my generation or it went extinct.",
    "Wanted to say goodbye I know, there are people who love me and need me. But itd be easier for them if they didnt, if i wasnt around. My father, im basically draining his bank account with all the help i need. My mother, our relationship does not exist. Birth parent didnt want me so i grew up in the orphanage. My friends have all moved on with their lives, we barely talk anymore. My girlfriend, all my needs and wants make her insecure.. she been my main reason for holding on. But now its not enough. I hate my body, and how hard it is to put on weight. I hate battling my demons. Im starting to hate God as well. Im a lost cause. I know it sounds stupid but i want to look good when i die. So im going to workout and become the most attractive and appealing version of myself, making amends with everyone ive hurt or disappointed, write my will, and then ill take one last stop to a church for the first time in 12 years, then im calling it quits. I love all of you, a lot of you kept me alive. Im sorry.",
    "How do others find energy to continue. I just feel so hopeless and numb been contemplating suicide more or less daily the last 5 years atleast. Pushing 30 hate my job, really hard finding a new one and once I do my employer sabotages my references and since there is an abundance of applicants like 200 for every job in my area they simply choose another one. Skilled craftsman in a field no longer required started my own company in highschool which went great for a few years until it didnt. Took my current shitty job to pay the bills, tried going back to college and working at the same time to avoid student loan but during my second year the depression really hit me and I dropped out and the last two years have been a constant struggle to come back mentally. I dont really enjoy anything anymore the only thing that keeps my mind occupied on more positive thoughts is spending a couple hours every day at the gym but even that is starting to diminish in effect. Pretty much isolated myself socially since I just feel worse trying to hang out with my friends. How do others find the energy to continue trying to improve their life with constant failure and rejections? I feel like Im stuck on the same page as if I were still 20.",
    "Why can't my friends and family see that I'm not fine? So this is hard for me, I really dont know where to start. Ive never felt fine, in my 31 years I cant remember actually feeling happy. Sure I smile and pretend Im ok to everyone I know. I get myself to work each day too, but only because its a routine. Pretty much twelve months ago something happened that triggered me to be bad enough that I couldnt sleep and I was having panic attacks about nothing. So I finally saw a doctor and she diagnosed me with anxiety, depression and stress... And referred me to see a psychologist but Ive had bad experiences with councilors when I was really bad at uni. So I got anxious about it and never went. I didnt want to be judged for what happened either. Ive tried to reach out to my partner, but she has anxiety too. If I lean on her too much she drops her bundle. She tells me shes happy and relentlessly reminds me that she wants to get married and have kids because were getting older. Ive told her that Im not having kids until I feel better, then I smile once and some how in her mind that makes me better. Otherwise we work really well together, except I never really feel like I feel in love with her. 7 years on Im still waiting for that spark. My family is fine, nothing bad ever really happened and we all talk, but it feels like they wouldnt notice if I wasnt around. They are so self obsessed, they call me to whine about the mundane things in there lives but never really ask how I am or if they do dont listen to what I have to say. I hate my job, sure most people do, but I find it so sole destroying. Feeling so shitty, I find it impossible to apply for others. I feel so trapped. I dont really have any friends I feel I can trust. At any rate I never let them see the depressed me, just my well practiced smiling facade. Ultimately I feel so incredibly lonely and isolated. Ive thought about leaving everything behind and taking a trip. Riding to Alaska and back again type thing.",
    "10 years and still in the same place I realized the other day that I had my first burn out at 22. Now I am 32 and going through another, plus a few in between. I got a call from work today and there was a complaint put against me because of my bad attitude at work. This is because I get anxious around people and I get aggressive as a defense mechanism. Its either that or I start crying. Well actually sometimes it is both. I feel like whatever I do, it is never good enough. I feel like I have fucked up my life so bad, who knows if I will be able to recuperate. I dont have friends, the only person I speak with is my mother, I live alone, work sucks, not implicated with anything because I cant keep a commitment. I just feel really lost. All I can think of is all the things I thought I would be by now. I figured that I would have some sort of career figured out, maybe own my place or have some saving, some friends or maybe a family. But I have none of that and with every passing day it feels like it is getting farther and farther away. I just feel like I cant get traction, I try different techniques but cant seem to put anything in place. ampx200B I honestly dont know what I am going to do. There is a good chance that I have come into contact with the virus and almost hope I die, then I wouldnt have to deal with this shit.

I think on some level I dont really understand people or how I should act around people.

Ive always been a little sad, i mean, nothing to worry, i think, because i felt happy sometimes and used to enjoy things. Ive always been too obsessed about the way i look, i think in a pathological level, avoided meetings because a felt ugly, dont eat or eating way too much, etc, so thats why i think this situation feels particularly hard. About a two months ago i thought i had a cavity in my tooth i dont know the word in english for caries. I stopped smoking. I went to the dentist, it wasnt that, she cleaned my teeth, but i was feeling like my four frontal teeth are moving, she said they dont move but i feel it. She said i have bruxism so maybe its that, but i literally cant eat because i feel that movement and it driving me nuts. I used to wear braces when i was a teenager, now days i need them again, and i cant look at the mirror. I want to go back in time. Im crying all day, i dont eat, i constantly think about killing myself because thats just my life, everything goes the worst way it can go since always. I dont have money to go to therapy, i tried to talk to people but they dont take me serious and say i should stop bother them. My boyfriend really tried to make me feel better but nothing worked and i knew he felt frustrated and i think angry because of the way i talk, so i started to act like everything is ok. Today my mom said i was skinny and i felt like crying because i know it is because i feel so terrible. I used to love my teeth, they were the only thing i liked about myself, i used to love smiling, now Im crying all day, feeling stressed, thinkin about killing myself. If Im alive today its just because I dont want to make my boyfriend sad and I dont want to leave my dog without me because he would miss me and nobody would take care of him or love him like i do.

    "Question about other conditions causing depression? Hello! Im new, so I hope this is ok to post. Ive been dealing with depression for many years, but feel like I only was able to put a name to and call it that for the past 5 years. I feel like my depression makes me struggle with motivation and avoidant about certain things I have to do for work. Recently though I have been struggling to determine if my inability to do focused work is due to my depression or if I have underlying attention issues. Does anyone have advice or experience with this? Cant having attention issues like ADHD make you frustrated and as a result depressed if untreated? How can you tell them apart? I have also have a similar question about undiagnosed autism and social isolation. How can you tell them apart? Thank you for any insights!",
    "advice on intrusive thoughts? So a couple of months ago, I did a thing where I memorized some phone number of a person that I dont get along with anymore. This has caused me to go on bouts of depression, lamenting about how my brain only memorizes information that is irrelevant, and how I wish I could forget everything. Long story short, it was a terrible friend breakup that developed into all kinds of mental illness, including OCD. I get the feeling sometimes that if I dont look to see what this person is doing, I feel like death. This is harmful for me, because I know that its a habit that Ive made and Ive now put a lot of weight in this. I told myself during corona that I want to start focusing on doing better and being better. All of this has weighed me down for 3 years now. How do you guys deal with intrusive thoughts? Is there a way to purposefully forget information? I feel like the amount of work Ive been putting in has been pretty good so far, but I can always be doing better. Theres no pathways for this shit. p.s. yes I am definitely in therapy!",
    "Help? Im not sure how to start or talk about this i hate asking for help or putting my problems on others but im realizing i probably need to talk to someone. Ig ill just say im not sure what to do with myself. Ive repressed emotions my whole life to the point that up until last weekend i dont think id cried since i was a kid even going through relationships and losing people emotionally or physically just nothing. My mom has mental issues she never told me about until just recently when i tried talking to her about whats been going on with me as shes an incredibly private person but i had my first anxiety attack this past weekend and cried more than i can remember ever crying. Ive lost interest inthe hobbies that made me who i am. Ive slowly lost all my friends after getting out of highschool 2 years ago and i used to have a big group. But i have no one to talk to or be able to open up to now that im trying to. Most of them i fell away from slowly or had a falling out with but my best friend since 3rd grade killed his sister after having a psychosis episode he was my go to always there for me and i grew up alongside his sister tho whole time. I work with his dad and do talk to him about this stuff but theres only so much i can talk about with him as he lost both his son and daughter in the same night and doesnt know how to handle things himself. The other person i was incredibly close with completed our trio died of an overdose a few hours after id left his house. Ive never had a girlfriend who i really opened up to or caught feelings for but now that i did i just fucked things up by overthinking things and id never quite cared for a girl like i do her. Im so lost. Thanks for reading you beautiful people",
    "Opening up Hiya! So Im a student at uni and I find it really hard to stay motivated to go to classdo anything most of the time. I hate that I feel that way, I was pretty depressed a few years back and now I feel like I might be relapsing in a way. The thing is though, my dads coming to see me in a few days, so hes going to be able to tell that I havent been that great. Usually when people come to visit me I try to hide all evidence of depression unwashed dishes, clothes everywhere, general messiness almost like an addict would hide their evidence. But now I dont even have the energy for that anymore. Im thinking of just admitting to my dad that Im not that well, but I know that would break both my parents heart. I just want them to be proud of me and I feel like right now Im not someone anyone could be proud of. I want to be able to function on my own and do great things but apparently Im not capable of that. Anyway my point is Should I be completely open with my parents about how Ive been feeling? Even though I know theyll be incredibly worried about me and maybe even disappointed? Should I start therapy again and never talk about depression with anyone else but a therapist? Because when I talk to friends or family about it I always feel like a burden and that Im hurting them. What do you guys think?",

    "Have recently started to come to terms with the fact that I'm a loser. While I am badly depressed, that is not the depression talking Other than the basement and the parents I meet the exact stereotypical requirements of a loser. While I have my reasons for the way I turned out I wont invoke them here so as to render them excuses. The fact is I have a personality like a moldy sponge covered in cooling diahria. Thats not all thats holding me back though aside from a badly wrenched spine and triple hernias two of which are inguinal, the third one in my navel has never been patched my asthma has somehow gotten so bad that they briefly identified it as COPD. I dont think Im quite staring down the barrel of that last depressive step yet but Im at the stage where I see things for what they are and I feel them closing in. I live off of supplemental income Im being thrown out of the room of the house Im renting tomorrow to if not the street, than a rundown motel for a few days then the street. I have applications through for apartments that I had to rely on a friend that I basically leech off of to make for me because I just cant mentally handle having to do stuff like that for myself. I dont drive. I have no actual family most who meet me hate me straight off and the rest always do eventually so maybe thats ironically for the best. Bottom line Im waking up to myself, and realizing that I just cant me anymore. Im not suicidal yet but I can hear it out there on the wind out there. Yet nor do I particularly care about self improvement. I just wanna be able to hack a passably comfortable life on my own merits with some real friends Im not bleeding of their energy and resources who can honestly say theyd come to my funeral and actually mourn.

I have no actual skills in much of anything, nor the basic knowledge of even how to obtain them while these things may not have been my fault to start with it seems the blame has in my thirties at least partially shifted to me.

    "Feeling at the end of the line As I mentioned I have anger issues and while I was working one day my boss called me to his office just to yell at me about a complain I presented to management about an issue with my laptop, I used to use my personal laptop to work in the office because they couldnt provide one for me and when it broke I asked them for a replacement, apparently this was out of line for them and he just begun insulting me with my colleagues hearing everything in the next room, I almost lost it but kept it together just enough to put myself face to face with him and asking him to repeat everything closing my fist ready to beat the shit out of him, he just stayed silent and I laughed at him and just turned away, a few weeks later I was fired if you think I should have reported him and the company I did but keep in mind this is Bolivia, there is no justice for anyone who doesnt have money so until today I havent been able to get another stable job and we basically just live with the food our families give us and small jobs I got and everything goes to pay the bills, on top of this, about a year and a half into our relationship when we moved in together and a month before getting fired we got a loan from the bank to began a business together and when she was set to go and make a deposit to buy our merchandise her uncle got notice of this and robbed her like a common thief yeah you read that right, so we went into debt with no job and no business, police and family where notified but the scumbag flew the country to Peru as far a we know. My wife knows about my rape and thanks to her I was able to talk to my sister about it too, needless to say I broke my sisters heart but also made us closer, she also was kind enough to pay for private professional help for me and her to deal with this, I also opened about this with an uncle my mothers brother who I thought was someone completely different to what he turned out to be, when I told him about the rape he broke hard and I took him to talk with the therapist I was seeing thanks to my sister, and what she told me before the therapist and told to him later changed everything, she said that I needed some sort of compensation for what had happened in order to move on, it wasnt possible to get legal justice due the time frame of the events and the lack of evidence beyond my word and she didnt suggest anything more beyond that we should try to figure it out, of course telling the whole family was my first thought and let the truth have its day, but my uncle mothers brother begged me not to tell anything because it would destroy the family, specially my mother who has a lot, and I mean a lot of love for the uncle who raped me, she my mother basically raised him the first 4 years of his life because his parents had a busy and privileged life and he the rapist is seen by the rest of the family as a great guy and an example, with this he mothers brother convinced me not to tell anything, I know I could have just said no and told everything to everyone but thinking what could I possibly put my mother through after seeing how his brother took the news made me feel trapped and basically Ive been living feeling like a prisoner and the responsible for my entire family being together or not.",
    "Can anyone give me a bit of hope please. I'm begging Feels like everyday my life gets a bit worse. Everyday I find a way to fk it up more somehow, I find a way to disappoint loved ones or just people in general. Today the day was livable so far, I was happy having my classes and I get the news that a friend I chat to daily has to stop chatting with me so often because his partner doesnt like the fact that we chat so often????? Like???? I cant believe this, we are friends, if anything Id say platonic friends, I dont know what to do, I just had my whole day and mental ruined by 5 voice messages and its just adding up to me wanting to end my fkn life even more. Some background, Im a very needy person Im the type of person to always reply instantly because Im always checking for friends messages because I feel without them Im unhappy, I love having someone giving me their attention all day, might sound toxic but so be it, Im nothing without friends either way. Well I dont know what else to say I cant think straight right now either Im so emotional I cant even reply back to my friends, Im lost",
    "I need help…. Im really struggling today. My normal coping techniques getting outside, watching a favorite show, etc arent working. Weekends are always tough for me. But its now October and my late Moms birthday is in two weeks. I was her caregiver. She wouldve been 65. Qualifying for Medicare and we couldve gotten so much more help for her paraplegia. And since she was a teacher i.e. state worker she didnt qualify for disability or other help. Thanks for nothing for her 25 years of service huh? Regardless, its bothering me more as this is the year her life wouldve gotten easier and mine and shes not here to enjoy that. I wouldve been helping her with her new paperwork, enjoying the research, etc. Add on to that, I took a new job in April, and while good, its a big change. I then lost my dog which was Moms as well in June so Im now alone. Im single as my caregiving responsibilities didnt give me a lot of dating time or opportunity. Nothing much excites me anymore. My music has fallen to the wayside. I cant enjoy playing a video game. And trying to lose weight for health during all this is just added stress. Ive never been a quitter, pretty ambitious guy. Not anymore. It took a year to get past my Moms death. But now losing our dog is like losing her all over again. Add in pandemic stress on that and there you have it. Ive had some really dark times here as of late. Just need to talk and some nonjudgmental help.",

I keep telling her that its her life and it shouldnt matter what they say but she totally convinced herself that she is good for nothing. She is always bullied by her parents like this.

    "Advice on how to deal/make progress The decision is made to up my sertraline dose to 150mg, although I note I am seeing a pattern of it stopping working every 3 years. They dont recommend therapy, as theyre not sure what to give me that I havent had already. The experiment with the 150mg doesnt go well, the sideeffects become really apparent and awful at this dose. We decide to discontinue and try something else. The psych recommends bupropion, but I have another idea in the mean time since Ive been reading the promising research on psilocybin which happens to be legal here. I try that once I am weaned off the sertraline and it works really well... for about 3 months. Then Im back to slipping into deep depression because its insufficient. I try the bupropion, but it doesnt agree with me. On day 4 I get a headache and malaise severe enough to knock me out completely for the day, and it feels like the skin on my head is on fire? That last one is extra worrying for me since I really dont want the alopecia that it can cause. I decide since its actually stopping me from doing social things I have left, I should discontinue. Thats where I am now. The situation is currently pretty bad, Im struggling to keep the suicidal ideation at bay. Im not actively under treatment of a psychiatrist at the moment, I would have to look for another referral. Obviously moving to a place where I actually have friends nearby would help, but even if I did find a house somehow, I am in no state to organise and execute a move. I honestly feel pretty bitter about society treats the less fortunate, Ive mostly just been left to deal with the consequences of austerity since the financial crash, the failing social housing policy, and the corona policies on top of that. Since Im not exactly clearheaded at the moment, Id like to know what youd do in my situation. I think I need another medication to try, or stick with bupropion for longer. But all of them are a mixed bag, with risks sexual dysfunction, or weight gain, or liver toxicity.",
    "My boyfriend is depressed, I want to help the right way Hi, so Im not sure if Im right here, but my boyfriend is having a severe depression since he is maybe 14. He is getting help since one year and takes serious dose of medication. Weve known each other since eight month. He is lovely, he is just the right guy for me and in my eyes he is perfect. He actually is always tired, in this state most of you probably know, but I think he is getting a little better. Only he has those phases where you just feel nothing and at the same time kind of despair and dont have any selfworth and I cant find the right words really. I hope you know what I mean. Well I dont know what to do. I always offer him to talk to me and say what he currently is feeling, only if he wants to of course, but he just says that since it is the same thing every time he just needs to get through it. I dont know if that is good for his mental state this believe, because I think he thinks he is troubling me by talking about this, but it is not. I have told him that I will listen even if it is the same thing every time and that he does NOT waste my time! Still I feel really helpless if he is in this state of mind and Im not even sure if I should say anything. And if you guys can tell me if there is anything you would like someone to say, do for you when you are in this state of mind, could you tell me? Maybe that will help me to say the right words, or show him my support the right way or that I should just leave him pass through it.. I of course realise that everyone in their depression is different and that there is not the right way, still maybe it helps.",
    "Girlfriend with depression pushes me away Hello, Me and my girlfriend have been dating for a few months now and everything was going good. I could see her love and smile and she was constantly there to either do something or help me. Now I know she had a history of selfharm and depression and Im not one to change her for what she feels, because I know thats almost impossible in the case of depression. Still I told her that Im there for here whenever shes in need. Yet ever since a week or two ago she started pushing me away and started to cut herself again. Before we started the relationship she told me she would probably push me away and said that she didnt mean for it to happen and was sorry if she would hurt me in any way. To be honest I didnt really think it would be this bad, but thats not the thing that hurts me the most. Personally, as a loved one, I think that seeing your loved one slowly fade away is the most painful part. It feels as if someone took over her body. I talked to her about it and I know she still cares about me, because she doesnt want me to feel bad. I told her that I would manage and that I would always be there for here and love her no matter what, but I dont know if I did the right thing or not and would like some advice in how to help her get through this phase. Lots of love and respect for all those who deal with this.",

These past few days have been really tough for me because my gf hides a lot of her feelings from me, and its getting worse. I tried to provide a safe environment to talk about them many times but after she does tell them, she feels a little happy, but the anxiety is a lot worse. This was caused because of her ex in the past, and weve been working together to help for over 6 months. Shes definitely been getting better, but I cant help with this because she just lies, and when I try to tell her, she shuts me down worrying it will hurt me. And I just dont know what to do. She refuses therapy because of past situations, and I dont know how to approach this. Any help and experiences are greatly appreciated.

    "I don't feel like a real person Ive been feeling better but I still feel like Im not a person and that I shouldnt expect the good things that happen to others to happen to me, because Im not one of them. I try and pretend really hard to be a real person but I know Im pretending. I dont get happy or excited, Im not motivated by passion or enjoyment. I dont have those feelings. Im looking to feel as distant from my hopelessness as I can, but that doesnt mean Im happy, just less hopeless. I feel like I should limit my impact on real people as much as I can, and not get in the way of them being happy. I feel like this world is created for real people and I just slipped through by accident, and as long as I dont get in the way they will tolerate me when Im with them. I feel like they can see me pretending, and they know Im not real, but they go along with it because of how pathetic I am, and they dont want to feel bad for showing me that Im not real. I know that this perspective is not reality, but thats how it feels. Ive never met another not real person, I feel very alone Im not in danger, I got past that a few months ago. I finally asked for help about 6 months ago after hiding it for 10 years. I dont really know how to talk about or think about the way I feel, and Im trying to figure that out. Im posting it hear because my next therapy session isnt for another 2 weeks and I dont really know what to do with this. I wanted to ask if anyone has felt this way and eventually not, because I dont know what its like not to feel like this. I cant imagine living like this and being happy.

    "Am I Disabled Enough? So it sounds like a joke but this is a true anxiety. My story without getting into it because its not the point just so you understand where Im from. Warning for all kinds of trauma. I live in Australia and I grew up in an abusive house. Mum would verbally attack my dad and the kids, hed get drunk and beat her in front of us and around and around we go. Mum finally left him for good when I was 8 because my eldest sister turned fourteen and declared she wasnt going back and would keep me and my other sister with her at the halfway house. So mum got a government funded house and took off in search of a good time and a new husband leaving my two older sisters to raise me. they were 14 and 12 to my 8 at the time. Left alone days at a time, my sisters pulled cash in hand work to feed us. My dad got visiting rights so when we went over there we were fed and clothed and he spoilt us rotten especially me but in unhealthy amounts. eventually my sisters stopped going but I loved it because there I could stay up as late as I want never bathe eat myself sick on junk and watch whatever adult tv I wanted. All I had to do was agree mum was a Btch and leave dad alone to do whatever he wanted. meanwhile at mums place she found a miner to latch too with three kids of his own. so now we were six kids between 143 being left alone days at a time and sharing one room. two years later my elder sisters ran away, my father cut contact as it was too much to deal with my mother trying to see me which i learnt to forgive him as an adult but as a kid it hurt and we were in a slightly bigger house. it was me and my step sister in one room, my two step brothers in another and my parents in the last. again, my mother was not present, either sleeping, or out socialising or gambling or in the shed smoking. my dad either worked or joined her. Now I was the caretaker. Needless to say various abuse emotional verbal occasionally physical and by my teens Im pretty messed up. I latch onto my own escape in the form of my high school boyfriend.",
    "Group video chat with friends makes me sad I had a group video chat with four friends on Zoom the other day I didnt enjoy it at all. There were two people in my group who were constantly talking about their own experience during quarantine, I tried to say my opinion and experience, but I felt my voice was submerged and unheard. They were saying in the group chat we should do another one soon I had to pretend to feel excited about it but in fact it made me more sad. What is wrong with me? A group of friends stress the hell out of me tbh.",
    "What happens when you get well? How often do you pop by the doc? Hi guys, I first went to a psychiatrist last summer. I had been selfmedicating something with tons of caffeine for years and wanted and needed to get to the bottom of why I needed large volumes of coffee in order to function the tipping point was having gallbladder surgery and caffeine being less of an option. Without it, there was an underlying tiredness and pessimism that wasnt shifting by itself, despite my best efforts at self care and healthy living. The past fourteen months has been the drug merrygoround Im guessing many here are familiar with. First tried every ADHD stimulant which all improved functionality like caffeine! but all literally every single one also made me more depressed. Then an SSRI which made me tired but more optimistic. Finally, weve moved onto Wellbutrin. Im wont to say wow, Im better! but I have a strong and positive feeling that this is going to be the chemical that shifts my dysthymia. Perhaps it will fizzle out. Perhaps Ill need something else. But .. after four weeks Im feeling optimistic and well in a way that I havent on anything Ive tried so far ie, Im more than just wired, Im confident and hopeful. My question now turns to okay, so whats next? Assuming that this is the drug for me, how often do you typically go to your prescriber just to make sure that things are working out okay? Is there such a thing as a yearly mental health checkup to verify that youre staying on course? Basically, once you finally manage to shift depression or at least get it to a manageable point ... what does the maintenance process look like?",

    "giving up Ive been depressed since 2013 and I feel like Im ungrateful because of it. I feel like Im hurting my mom. Im almost 20 and I lost all my youth on it. My dad left when I was 5 and I started to get really sad but depression just came out when I became a teenager. Im doing therapy and it makes me feel better sometimes, Im taking pills too, but I still hate myself, I hate everything I do, everything I am and it kills me to think Im hurting my mom and my grandmas. Every month my psychiatrist tells me Ill have to take more antidepressants because Im not getting better. A few weeks ago she told me I have a bordeline historic besides depression and anxiety, and I hate that my mom is paying for all my pills and my treatment while Im planning to kill myself. I know she wouldnt be happy if I was dead, but Im struggling, Im too tired now, after almost seven years. I tried to kill myself once last month with sleeping pills, but my family took me to emergency. I saw my mother crying and I couldnt do much more than hating myself violently. Im thinking a lot about trying again. I dont know what to do, I feel like my mind is trying to drag me to hell. Well, I dont have no one to talk about it anymore, so Im sorry for this sad shit.",
    "The best discord friends I’ve ever had suddenly cut ties with me back in October. I’m really hurt bad and I can’t move on. I had so many amazing memories with them. I remember excitedly hurrying home from work every day to chat and play games with them. We shared jokes and memes all the time. We disagreed and argued sometimes, but isnt that how all friendships go? In OctoberI think the eighth, I got a DM from one of them. They called me emotionally manipulative and declared the friendship to be over. In addition, they said I couldnt do anything to reconcile with them the decision was final. They kicked me out of every discord server they moderated and I assume blocked me on all social media. They never told me what Im specific I did wrong. They never told me beforehand that something was going on. Right up until that DM I thought things were ok between us. I just feel so evil and disgusting and not deserving of life.

My boyfriend immediately got a job and hes working long hours, meanwhile Im at home alone just waiting for him to come back. Ive had depression and anxiety for years and years, it was slowly getting better but I still had my rough days from time to time.

I have no desirable skills, I cant speak the language. Who in their right mind would employ me? I was honestly doing so well for the first month since I got here, loving the country and just feeling fresh and new. I posted on an expat subreddit for the country Ive moved to on a different account with a question I had, because I honestly had no idea where else to ask it. I tried so hard to phrase the question in the best, clearest, most polite way possible, because I was worried about being a burden. There were a few people who answered my question and were helpful but it got downvoted a lot, because someone reposted my post on a different subreddit made for making fun of people. And the repost got so many upvotes. It had people in the comments calling me retarded, and a fuckwit and stupid and just generally shitting on me. I wish I never posted anything, Im probably going to regret posting this as well. Im so completely crushed. Ive never been bullied this badly before. I dont trust anyone anymore.

    "I thought it would go away Ive been depressed since childhood. It was really rough growing up and I had a hard start. I pushed through so much and was finally able to get my degree and a great job. I make more money than I need, and I came from living in my car. I finally have all my ducks in a row and yet here is my depression. Almost three years ago I got put on 300mg Wellbutrin XL. For the first time in my life I felt what it was like to walk around without the lead weight in my chest. About eight months in, the meds stopped working and I had one of the worst depressive episodes of my life. They bumped me to 450mg which is the absolute max dose. Its been a couple years since then and Im worried the medication has once again stopped working. Im a 30 year old woman and Im feeling defeated by this thing. Is the rest of my life just me repeatedly defeating and beating down my depression? I think about having kids but I always think it would be so unfair for them to have me as a mother. What if I reach a point I cant take it anymore and I really do and up ending it. How could I leave children that way? I guess Im spiraling here.

She does not care a crap about my need for privacy, she peeks into my phone, my books, my laptop, and what not, every chance she gets. She constantly hurls curses at me even if something goes minutely wrong or her needs and wants arent satisfied the way she wanted them to be.

Apart from that, I receive other constant curses like, you wont live a good life at all, your life will be terrible, youll burn in hell, your future will be terrible, and your husband will be a bad man okay, first of all, Im TERRIFIED of relationships, marriage, or anything that has to do with the romantic paradigm. Ive even talked to her about this but she cant help but obsess over me getting married, instead of me having a stable career. Whats worse? She has no logical reasoning behind this obsession, and tries to sell me to the same institution marriage that ruined her and continues to ruin many others! She yells at me for trivial things, and absolutely despises it when I even look at a person from the opposite sex  heck, she doesnt want me to even talk to MY OWN FATHER! She constantly feels entitled to just barge into my room to deliver twohour lectures about how she knows whats best for me, and how I should become the ideal daughter that she pictures in her head  a socially awkward, terrible at communicating, familyoriented yes woman, without any inclination towards her career and even if so, abysmally little interest must be exhibited.",
    "Breaking up gave me depression.. and I want to speak my mind.. please be nice. I turned to religion for answers, I have been blessed to receive answers, I know 100 that this is all going to blow over, and the sun will shine on me once more. But sadly, it did not take the pain away. The pain is very real and I was trying to numb it with WHATEVER helps. I did not write this to blame my ex. I have read and searched for answers to know that, this isnt her fault. I shouldnt blame her for making a call that I couldnt make. I couldve walked away when the signs came out, but I didnt. Yes, she caused the initial heartbreak, but I am 100 responsible for the actions I have taken upon myself, and how I treat myself postbreakup. It took months for me to realize this, but it doesnt make things easier. I am still looking for ways to keep moving on with my life and try to be the best version of myself. I see clearly now because the clouds that have clouded my judgment had disappeared. Its somewhat amazing to see how far I have gone, yet scared of whats going to come. I have seen so many things from this depressing perspective, and I am not satisfied with the person I am. No one really knows what drove her away. Nonetheless, I aspire to be a better person in many ways. I aspire to be better in terms of mental health, relationship with God, and my character. This crazy experience in my life has taught me to appreciate loved ones, parents in particular. Only when God takes away someone that I care about, I realize how lucky I am to have loving parents and supportive highschool friends that have kept in touch with me through this tough time. Yes, they can help me, but they can only do so much. I dont revolve around their life because they have their responsibilities and commitments. However, at the end of the day, I know that I am responsible for my happiness and I have to drag myself to the place I want to be.",
    "When I'm depressed I have nothing to say. When Im not depressed it is easier to socialize, but when Im depressed I literally have nothing to say. It doesnt sound like much to someone who takes this skill for granted but when Im depressed its a killer. They say dont isolate when youre depressed but being around people makes me feel worse. I just cant get around this cause literally the need to socialize is pervasive. Is there any way around this?",
    "I’m afraid of starting antidepressants. My depression has gotten much worse in the past couple of months. Ive been seeing a therapist for a while now, but more recently I asked my psychiatrist starting an antidepressant. We both agreed it would give me the best chance of seeing any improvement that I have at this point. Heres the thing though, Im really nervous about taking them. Im worried Itll change me in some negative way, or significantly change my personality. So Id really like to hear from others about their experiences on medication, hopefully to get some reassurance and help me feel a bit more comfortable about starting something that could possibly help me a lot.",
    "I changed physically I 27f recently got a dramatic haircut and gained weight about 5kg and was too depressed to do anything about it. It lead to acne, hair all over my body and face Its getting worse with my need to be validated and I feel that the more needy I become the less people reassure me or want to interact with me. My social media likes have gone from 100 to 0 real fast and I have no self esteem any more. I wonder if I whined about my image too much and if my friends just hate me now or got sick of me. I am since trying to tackle the weight and interact positively on Facebook and Instagram but no one wants to know any more. Has depression and anxiety ruined my life? My image to myself and others? I feel all alone.",
    "I want to die there’s always blow after blow I can’t deal with them anymore This is too hard. I can come out of these deep depressive states but over the years the length of time Im out of them just continually get smaller and the length of time Im in them is longer and darker. This time I was out for 2 days. Ive just completely dived back in. I cant see any light when Im like this. I cant eat I cant sleep I cant get out of bed I only think about killing myself. I live alone and its very common for me to not reply to my friends and family, I dont think people would notice for days. I tried anti depressants for the first time, which was a big step for me. SSRI. I became more suicidal but they also knocked me out for about a week. I came off them and felt great for two days bc I had energy. Then felt the dark cloud coming back and tried to work with my psych to help myself not get drenched again, maybe just a light shower and get back up. But now Ive suffered a big emotional blow in one of my relationships  and Im just not equipped to handle such a thing right now. I can only talk to my psych and my friend about it. My friend hasnt responded and I havent got a psych appointment for 3 weeks. Usually knowing Ill see her weekly helps me get through the hard days",
    "My heart is broken! Hi everyone! I do this first time in my life, write a post about my problems. Yesterday, girl left me. Yes, girl, not girlfriend. We know each other a half of year and I love her, but she doesnt. Thats okay! The idea of stopping relationship is mine, because this is very difficult. She allowed me to get her hand, we walked holding hand. I thought relationships was developing, but no. I asked her what happened, and after long conversation we realized that she doesnt feel that feel I. Now I am thinking about her constantly. That was my third relationship and previous relationships were easier, I mean stopping. I am disappointed in the relationship and it seems that everything is lost for me.

    "Medication mood drops Hi, Ive been on two medications for a short time. Clomipramine for my depression and Methylphenidate commonly known as ritalin for ADHD. While I have noticed and upturn in my general mood, it seems to drop throughout the day at regular times. Before 10am, Im actually quite good and productive. By 11, I can feel a real drop in my mood. By 1pm Im completely gone and miserable for the rest of the day. Basically Im just wondering if others have experienced this kind of mood drop when put on meds. I feel it must be a positive in the sense that I have a decent mood in the morning but I hate how quick it drops off. Any tips? Ive told my doctor and Im not after real medical advice. Just asking if anyone else has experienced this and whether it got better.",

Ive started some new meds and have no idea if they will work but I dont remember what it was like to not be in dark place mentally. What if I dont know know who I am without depression? I havent had an extended period of a good spell for 15 years, this started when I was about 12 so I just dont know what things would be like if the meds did actually help. Is this a silly thing to be anxious over? Anyone have any advice or been through this too?",

    "Want go back to my life before all of this. Please help! How can I get over this obsessive fear of others opinions? It is ruining my life It is confusing, but I guess my fear isnt that I am a pedophile because Im not. I actually fear the possibility of me fearing that I am a pedophile... sorry if that makes no sense. I kind of deviated from the main point, but I think the root of all my fear, is from fear of judgment. I constantly worry like oh god, I had another groinal response. How will I ever explain this to my future partner? I even go as far as to play out scenarios in my head, where I try to detail my problems to people. I just find it hard to stop thinking about others opinions. I feel like if I were to describe my issues like I did above, so many people would think I am a horrible person. I dont want to be a bad person. But going through all this the intrusice thoughts, grounal response, etc. I feel like the scum of the earth. Like, even if it was due to anxiety and nothing more, who would ever get a feeling down there when ruminating about child sexual abuse?? I want to be done with this, and hopefully I will get better with the help of my new therapist. But this constant fear of what other people think is ruining me. I want to have lasting relationships, and feel like I deserve them. I want to find love, and have good friends. But I feel like I will never deserve it, even after I eventually get through this. If anyone has any advice or success in this department, please let me know. I know deep down that I am not technically a bad person, because bad people do bad things without worrying about being bad. But it is hard to accept that these intrusive thoughts paired with the groinal response does not make me a disgustingly vile person.

    "I ( 26 female ) have decided to take care of my severely depressed younger brother (20m ) by letting him move in with me last week and need some tips. Not exactly suicidal in that he does not intent to kill himself but he is fed up of living so could very well do something dangerous if this continues . I have been pestering my brother to move out of my parents for the longest time. He finally did last week and came to live with me. I congratulated him for taking the right steps. I told him he always has a place with me. And this is why I still took him in despite having reservations as I am not exactly where I want to be in my life financially either but I am doing better than him and better than before so I felt like its worth a shot  and still do  . He has never worked a single job because of his mental illness and because of my parents hostility. This past year I have focused a lot on healing from my own health issues had two surgeries and heart issues but I feel better than ever before and also getting over a breakup which is hard for someone like.me who tends to get reactive depression as a result of difficult life events . Im doing well at work, was recruited by my manager to follow into her foot septs and applied to a program at McGill university that my employer would pay for the purpose of developping my career at the hospital I work for. I work in admin and might work in management following this management succession program  if they accept me because even though I was recruited still waiting for acceptance letter . But it took me a long while to get to a place where I can be stable enough mentally to get back on track or at least try too. I have anxiety too  was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder  but I feel like its been under control the last few monrhs. Moreover , I have my own fears of failure as Ive had a difficult experience with school in the past even though I graduated highschool and college .. My brother is the sweetest person. He is 20, however never grew up or matured properly due to lack of socialization... Never experience love, only had friends before his teens and made virtual friends via his gaming on Xbox until this day...",

    "I can’t help myself, and there is nowhere to get help. Things keep getting worse. I am not suicidal, I have always contemplated suicide but I know that I wouldnt go through with it. Lately I noticed that I have been thinking about it more often though. I am saying this because I dont even know if things are actually getting worse. I cant even allow myself to feel bad because I dont really know if Im supposed to feel bad. Im trying to justify why I think that things are getting worse by saying that I think about suicide more often. I dont really know what Im feeling. Im feeling something but I dont know what it is or whether or not Im supposed to feel it. But I guess I can say that Im feeling pretty hopeless. I did Becks Depression Inventory and it seems like I have moderate depression. Which is not a new thing for me, Ive had depression for the last 67 years. Im 23 btw. I used a lot of medications, I also went to therapy for about 78 months. I cant go to therapy anymore because I dont have the money for it. I cant ask for money from my parents because they need to support my sister who is going to go to uni. There are no free therapists around either. I also dont know if I should go to therapy. Am I being selfish? Am I indulging in my thoughts and feelings too much? Other people have problems too, and I would be lying if I said that I have it worse than most people. I also failed at school. In 6 years I was only able to finish the first years classes. I am... lazy. Irresponsible. In the past and maybe even right now, I have acted without thinking about others. My parents worked hard to make sure I can get education. I am ashamed of myself for not doing what I needed to do. I am also ashamed of lying to them about my school. They still dont know that I failed. I dont know if I can say that I tried to fix whats wrong with me.",

But feeling better naturally comes with worrying about losing this goodness... a lot... I worry about losing her so much that its probably not having a very good impact on our relationship... Even though I feel better that doesnt mean Im totally fine. I still get these waves of insert any of my problems here. We very often argue when this happens. Im extremly worried that this will end up ruining my relationship with her. She will not like me anymore if I keep having these waves... Yesterday we were talking and she brought up how I have very low selfesteem. She wanted to help so she recommended something that has helped her with her selfesteem issues. Go to a mirror and say I love myself. I was almost unable to do this... I mean I said it but I didnt belive it and it made me feel way worse because I didnt think it was THIS BAD... Then I realized how much I dont like myself... Ive felt like shit because of that since yesterday. Its getting better today, thankfully.

    "Everything fell apart after a failed business and a failed psyche. Figuring out next steps. 26m I had pretty moderate social anxiety through high school and college ultimately fueling depression. Went to get treatment before senior year of college, threw me on Zoloft and Klonopin. Helped a bit and was doing okay, graduated with great grades despite issues, information systems and marketing undergrad. Had a pleathora of random skills across the board mostly in the real of webdev and design, used to be passionate about photography but all passions have fallen off lately. Started a freelance drone services business out of undergrad despite not understanding just how much student debt I was in....in my name 60,000, in my parents name another ungodly amount...further fueling depression. Still living with parents in hope of hitting it big with the business. Things started off slowly so I went into an MBA program on the weekends while working on the business during the week. Psychiatrist put me on adhd meds too which helped. Graduated 2017 from that, business wasnt making any profit still, mainly breaking even didnt start off with any real capital so I was bootstrapping. Was still doped up on meds so I was still hopeful and disregarded the fact I wasnt making any real money. 2018 really nasty suicidal depression starts kicking in along with cognitive side effects and deteriorating memory. Business still breaking even, though halfway through the year almost landed a huge deal that wouldve put me way in the green. Came soooo close but then everything fell apart. Psychiatrist leaves the state halfway through the year and have to find a new one. New one takes me off klonopin too fast and takes away my adhd med and Im left like a deer in headlights for 6 months in a state of psychotic withdrawal unable to answer texts, emails or phone calls...couldnt even leave the house. Psych didnt care and made me suffer through it. Business fizzled out, wasnt making any money, trying to recover at home. 6 months later things started getting a little better, started tapering my way off Zoloft slowly. Got back on adhd med in 2019, went and got a low paying but close IT job in September.",

    "there's no point in life if i can't sustain attention to enjoy it thought it was depression. idk, maybe it is. but if its adhd, then i dont want to live anymore. ive had enough of life. life has given me countless traumas from the day i was born. an abusive father who did things ranging from yelling at me for crying as a baby my earliest memory to almost terminating my life a few times to asking me for money after all that. im poor and had such an unfulfilled childhood bc it was wasted away in front of the tv bc my mom could not afford anything for me. high school was wasted away in front of textbooks. almost all of grade school was a dessert of social interaction almost nobody could be friends with me. but now, i might have a permanent condition that will never, ever go away? that will stick with me my entire life? this is kind of the last straw for me...? whats the point if i cant fix any of my own flaws? whats the point of life if i cant sustain the attention to enjoy anything? i wont be able to sustain any hobbies, pay attention through movies, keep any lasting friendships bc i cant understand social interaction, or show my family that i care about them bc ill always forget their birthdays. ill never succeed, ill never be good at life. ill always be bored. nothing will ever be enough for me. ill always be thought of as a weirdo, bc it turned out i was a weirdo the whole time. this was it. this is what turned others off from me the whole time. i thought it was the stuff like flinching from being hit. now this is just another added layer. ill never be able to keep up in conversations, to look like im paying attention, ill never know humor or jokes bc im too late to them. all the joys in life, everything that i thought was worth living to see in life, is now gone, because my brain is abnormal and incapable. i feel disgusting. i feel inadequate. i feel like a total idiot, not knowing i was really just born with a faulty brain the whole time.",
    "Wife wants space to fight depression Sorry if wrong thread but I feel like maybe people have more first hand experience with something like this. So a month ago, my wife moved out of our home after admitting that her depression has taken its toll on her and she gave me the old quote I love you, but Im not in love with you. We have been married just shy of a year but have been together for 6 years prior to that. She was distraught when she dropped that bombshell on me and I felt my whole world crumble. She is adamant that I havent done anything wrong and that Ive done nothing but care, respect and been loyal to her and she feels ashamed to feel like this, and she just needs to have time and space for her self to figure out herself and if she got into a relationship with me for the right reasons she was in 2 really toxic relationships previously and then started a relationship straight away with me, and she doesnt know if I was a crutch for her or if it was genuine. For a while she has been unhappy with her job, the house we live in and our financial situation finances are now pretty much resolved after making some sacrifices and also with lockdown she has essentially been a prisoner in her own home for 3 weeks. I have given her the perfect opportunity to tell me if she was having an affair. I told her that if she told me the honest truth, I will not react in anger or resentment, and I would just accept her decision and I would have to think things through for a while. She again has been adamant there is nobody else involved. She has booked her self in for councelling with her depression and I think that starts pretty soon. I feel in complete limbo land at the moment and I feel scared and alone and worried about what the future holds. I have made contingency plans if things go south. I speak to friends and family about this situation and the advice is poor at the best of times. People keep telling me that I should give her an ultimatum and pressure her into coming back, which I know is completely wrong and its something I should not do. I have made the conscious decision to fight with every strand of my being to save this marriage and I will not be the one that ends it.",

I am 2 types of medication that have side effects including depression,anxiety etc all the bad stuff. Ive never got this feeling before I went on them so I know its the meds.

I attempted suicide in April 2018 but, since then, Ive made a lot of progress and Im quite happy with myself. But loneliness is still a major trigger for my depression. Tomorrow Ill leave for another city because I have to participate in a public competition for a workplace Im in Italy so, in order to work for the Government, you have to participate to public selections. Problem I dont know anyone in this city so Ill be alone for seven days. Yes, Ill meet other people who apply for the same selection, but at the end of the day Ill return to my hotel room and Ill be alone. And Im very scared. This is my self care plan, that I organized with my therapist  focusing on the public selection  bringing my favourite books  Netflix for the nights  going to fine restaurants and enjoying good food  visiting the city in my spare time  calling my SO andor friends if I really feel overwhelmed Do you have any other advice? Im a bit anxious. Thank you!",

    "Feeling bad for doing better? Let me start with a little backstory. My mental health has been slowly deteriorating since October. It got to the point in JanuaryFebruary where I couldnt function normally, I wasnt going out, I couldnt eat, slept the days away and I even failed one of my classes because I couldnt focus on studing. At the end of February I went to my universitys psychologist and the lady suggested that I should go to the psychiatrist and go on antidepressants. I wasnt really surprised so Ive made the appointment and was really hopeful to get my life together. But then the coronavirus happend, my appointment got cancelled, uni went online and I had to go back home. I was terribly disappointed, to say the least. And because Im home and Im around people all the time I dont allow myself to be extremely depressed. I force myself to go out of bed, to eat, to somehow function because Im scared to show how Im trully feeling. Ive completely disconnected from my feelings to the point where I dont feel anything. And in the back of my head there is that voice, that is saying that Im faking being depressed, that if I wanted to I couldve been better at the begging of the year, that its all in my head and I had no reason to feel this way. So my question is how to understand that just because Im doing better at the moment Im not magically healthy? Because Im afraid that Ill convince myself that I dont need help and I wont ever go to psychiatrist.",

    "Friend committed suicide during quarantine and I feel myself backsliding I dont really have a whole lot to say. Ive struggled with depression most of my life. I was actually starting to really deal with a lot of my problems and was sort of discovering my will to live and fight for myself. I think its still there, but it feels like a plane whos propellers are more often off than on. In any case, a friend of mine who was living in my old room committed suicide and Ive been struggling ever since. I dont feel like I can reach out to my friends because I already exploded on one of them and I think they are wary of me. I can just tell theyre all walking on eggshells and I hate feeling this fragile and out of control. Ive isolated myself to keep it from happening again. The thing I didnt expect is how angry I am. I have been having like violent visions and thats not really something thats ever happened to me before. Thats the part that I dont feel like I can share with anyone. When I look at my anger from a more logical perspective, I know its not justified, and yet thats often not enough to make it go away. I feel like Im fighting for my life because of this. And to be honest one of the things that has kept me from doing anything is knowing how much Ive been traumatized by this and the fact that I really wouldnt wish this on anyone else. I dont know what Im looking for, but if there is someone out there whos dealt with this and can offer me some advice?",

    "I feel like killing myself would be the best option for most people in my life Dead end job, schooling that almost only stresses me out, relationships falling apart, and nearconstant suicidal thoughts have been making me feel like most people would be better off without me. All I am is a waste of space, time, resources, and thought and although things may be temporarily shitty for some people if I were to kill myself, I think itd be overall worth it and beneficial for others in the end. Every day feels boring, yet I constantly feel like I do it to myself. I lost enjoyment in most things months or years ago and am just exhausted of forcing myself to be positive to others and trying to not let my misery show. Right now, there are only three things are really keeping me from doing it I dont want others to feel like they could have done something which is an almost inevitable outcome, I dont want my younger siblings to not have an older brother to look up to, and I have an ever decreasing hope of things getting better. I guess I just dont see the point in keeping myself around, everyday is dreadful and more often than not, miserable. I dont have anything to look forward to, and the monotony and boringness of life is getting to me. I guess Im asking for some advice or help but I dont even know",
    "I'm getting angry at my depression. I want to break out of it and I can't seem to shake it. There are tons of various things that have contributed to my mental state at this age. Abusive parents with narcissistic personality disorder, running around with bad friends, I was molested sort of, and publicly, starting drugs in middle school and becoming addicted by highschool, heavy psychedelic use, and whatever quirky autistic spectrum disorder or attention disorder caused school to be so overwhelming for me growing up. I want to feel better, thats for sure. But I look at normal functioning and it doesnt match my ideal for what a human life should be. Ive looked down on normalcy for a long time because it leads to brainwashed nonindividuals, not questioning yourself, and honestly I think it limits our evolution. I dont like where the world is going and it alienates me in addition to my mental state. These past couple of months I have reverted to terrible behaviors and failed a lot. I failed one of my college courses I had a 3.7 gpa prior, Ive been blowing up at work and unable to get my work done properly, on my days off I either lay in bed all day or smoke a bunch of weed and drink and party with friends I cant have fun without substances and havent even since I quit hard drugs like opiates and benzos 4 years ago, I tell myself to get it together and I just dont have the willpower because Im not happy about my opportunities in life. Im going to school to become a teacher, before this I had a 2 year existential crisis where I didnt want to do ANYTHING and I would become psychotic and suicidal, I just hated everything in life and I felt like I had tasted multiple ways of living and none of them resonated with me. Now I feel like this again. My routine was interrupted by covid19 and even though I was still a mild nicotine addict and had a mental breakdown during every homework assignment, I would push myself. Now I feel like Ive backslid and Im right where I was 2 years ago. I wasnt able to complete homework because of mental fog and everytime I opened my online class dashboard I would break down and cry until I fell asleep.",

    "Advice to an 18 y/o depressed closeted bisexual dude who mostly has anti-lgbt religious family &amp; friends and is contemplating suicide? Theres this one friend, lets call him Matthew, who used to be my youth group leader and is also a fan of RuPauls Drag Race and Queer Eye. We both went to the same school same grade but different strands in Senior High. However, Im not so sure if hed react positively if I openly accept my bisexuality since the church he serves in has made antilgbt preachings. When we graduated Senior High School on April last month, I messaged him amp promised wed catch up with each other about life since we havent talkedseen each other at church for a long time, but we still havent done it and still havent talked to each other ever since. Maybe I might come out as bi to a few close friends soon, or maybe not. Ive noticed my teacher from 11th grade seems to be an ally and I even consider him a great close friend, so hes definitely one of the first people Ill come out to IF I decide to do it. I think to myself that some things are better left unsaid, but these unsaid words are killing me, and theyve been building up in my head for a long time. Its hard to be yourself when youre not what most people wantexpect you to be. Ive been thinking about leaving this Earth, maybe write individual notes to each of my friendsfamily before I go. The only reasons why I still havent pursued this is because I dont want to hurt my family amp friends, and Im afraid of dying without fulfillment for now, at least. And even if I come out to a few friends, what if the word comes out and it got spread to some people until it might reach my familyfriends and they avoid me? Its just hard to wrap my head around. Theres always those things amp thoughts bringing me down. I consider myself an agnostic now. I just want to be accepted but I fear the peoplefamilyfriends around me wont take it well.

    "To medicate or not.. About 2.5 years ago I was diagnosed with depression  anxiety no biggie. It runs in the family, its a biological depression as one side of the family doesnt produce enough serotonin, so nothing actually happened to me to set it off. But it affected a lot of things that I wanted control over, I wasnt living my best life. I went on medication Venlafaxineffexor, and it helped dramatically. Though I gained 15kgs in the 6 months. So I came off. Ive been good for 2 years, I got the weight back down, and Im hovering between average and athletic. But recent changes in my life have stirred the pot. Mirtazapine is a recommendation that should work differently and not cause the weight gain. I dont want to go on the meds again if Im going to gain that weight back so fast. I dont want to be on meds my whole life like my family members. But nor do I want to stay like I am currently. So how do I decide? Flip a coin? My psychologist and psychiatrist havent been able to help me make my mind up. Anybody been on mirtazapine? Does it cause weight gain and kill libido? Not that I have a libido at the moment anyway, thanks life",

    "Severe anxiety and depression Most of my life I have suffered with depression, anxiety, self deprecating thoughts and worse case scenario imagery in my head almost nonstop. Its like a movie that never stops playing. I currently take 120 mg daily of CBD spread throughout to help manage my symptoms. Is there any hope for me to be alright without taking so much medication. To put it in imagery, It really feels like its a python constantly wrapped around my neck and When I take medication, I feel it let go for a while but can also still feel it just sitting there in the corner waiting for it it wear off so it can pounce right back on and keep strangling me. I need a long term solution. it has gotten so bad that I cant stop taking the CBD for more than a day without experiencing severe mental distress. Sometimes I cannot even function without it. When I took CBD for the first time it was also the first time I had ever felt normal. I am grateful to have this medication but at the same time I do not want to have to depend on this for the rest of my life. I just want the normal brain chemistry that other people seem to take for granted. Having a normal day for me is so rare its like finding buried treasure for me. And then I want to stay normal so bad and hold on to that good feeling that ironically, I bring the anxiety back about trying to stay feeling normal. It almost feels hopeless. Is there any hope that I can ever have a normally functioning mind without taking large amounts of medication?

    "I could use some help figuring out if there‘s a possibility I‘m suffering from depression This could turn out to be kinda long so I apologise in advance if anyone wants to read this. Long story short Im not sure if Im actually depressed or just imagining things. So, this took quite a lot for me to post this and I will try my best to describe my situation. Some general information Im 15M and have like a lot of germans been at home for homeschooling for almost a year know except for a few months where we went to school in person. To be honest I dont really know when things started but I was talking to a friend of mine videochat about a month ago and after he asked I explained to him how I was feeling. When I was done he said something along the lines of Hmm that kind of sounds like some depression you got there. Now to what I told him I think I stopped expressing how I feel at any given time at least a year ago and since covid took hold things have only gotten worse. I cant remember the last time I cried tbh i felt like crying pretty often lately or truly told anyone I wasnt doing too well. I always pretend Im happy and everything is normal so neither my parents nor my friends start worrying about me. One thing that really bothers me is that every time my friends who I 200 trust ask how Im doing I tell them fine. The conversation with my friend was an exception i guess. I want to explain it to them SO bad but somehow I keep stopping myself. A minor thing that might be worth mentioning is that I unfortunately remember practically every single mistake in my only relationship I ever had with a great girl I am not really over yet, friendships and in general ALL THE TIME. I always have to distract myself with something because every time Im left alone with my thoughts I go down the good old Why did I do that? Why would anyone do that? Whats wrong with me? Does heshe still remember that? road. School is almost insufferable because it leaves me a lot of time to think to myself and unfortunately its rarely happy thoughts. The thing that makes all this so hard to decipher for me is that Im never certain how I feel.",
    "Life’s going downhill and everything that happens is mainly my fault My next issue is this incident that happened with my crush. Now Im assuming its normal to crush on people when youre 13, right? Well this one was my fault. I was texting my friend on discord, and we brought the topic up. We were just joking around, and then I said something, a little more... questionable. He laughed at it, and so did I, because say what you will about it, it was pretty funny. Were both in this discord server with a lot of people from our school in it, including my crush. However, one time when I was on the server, we were teasing each other. Normal, right? But then I got this dm saying shut up or Ill leak the photo or something around those lines. I was like um... okay because even though I knew what he did was technically black mail, I didnt want the photo to be leaked so I just shut up. This threat continued a couple more times until this happened. He didnt leak it to the chat, but he showed it to some of my friends. They were like bruh wtf and I explained the context of the image and how I didnt mean anything I actually said. But then he showed it to this one person, and it was this boy my crush is edating. I was on the server, when I got a dm from him saying Ill leak the photo to the server. When I pleaded him not to, he just said Yes and then sent the photo into the server, where everyone saw, including my crush his girlfriend. I was miserable. I left the server and went to bed, talking to myself about how I should just kill myself tonight well get to that soon and end it all. It was a while ago, and the drama seemed to die down, but I had to explain to my crush everything and she seemed to have forgiven me. However, people still bring it up and show the image, especially when my crush is still around. I beg to them not to as it obviously makes her uncomfortable but they wont stop, my sin wont leave me, no matter what I do.",

I thought it was just one post bashing PQ, but it seems that theres nearly nothing positive to say about it, other than the fact that it, relative to other similar programs, has a better quality of life and that seems like its not saying a lot at all. What do I do in terms of my parents, brother, and PQ? I really am terrified for my brothers well beingfrom reading, it seems that PQ is nothing but regressive for health. Should he stay? Come home asap? Is coming home soon feasible? More in general as well what can I do to help my brother out? Thank you.",
    "We were engaged. He left me for a 19 year old he has been talking to online for the past 3 months This will be quite a long story, and I also apologize in advance for any grammar mistakes, Im Brazilian and English is not my first language. In 2017 I was 18 I met an American through an app called Yellow it doesnt exist anymore. He was 20. We talked for over two years before we got to meet in person. Our love grew and even though we didnt consider ourselves a couple because it would be crazy to start a relationship with someone that lives almost 10 thousand kilometers from you that youve never even met in person, we didnt have anything with anyone else in the meantime. To be honest though, he wanted us to assume ourselves as a couple back then, but I refused. We were always messaging, video calling and sending each other cards for special dates, so we could have something palpable. In 2019 I got my very first job was an internship actually, I didnt make much, but I saved all the money to buy a plane ticket to go there and see him. Important to mention that his parents didnt trust me enough to let him come here first, because theres this stereotype of people from third world countries wanting to marry people from rich countries just to get citizenship, so in order to prove I wasnt that type of person I had to go there first. I spent a long time trying to convince my parents to do so and also raising money for the ticket. Our mothers actually started messaging each other throughout the process, and that helped build some trust. Finally the day came, I got enough money for the ticket and bought it. That was one of the happiest days of my life. That was June 2019. We met on January 2020. The rest of 2019 I was just dreaming about the special day and I was so motivated I got the best grades ever at university. My life was perfect, I had nothing to complain about. So the day came. After almost 24 hours of flying and airport layovers, I was there. It was a feeling Ill never forget a mix of the good type of anxiety and victory for finally being able to meet the guy I loved. I stayed there with him from January to March 2020.",
    "Depressed International Student; need help I start working on something and feel it is totally pointless. I start watching youtube or the office to feel a bit better and suddenly it is 6 pm. I think that its already evening, maybe I should go out, get some fresh air. I go out, pickup a friend and smoke a cigarette or two my friend doesnt smoke. While coming back, I feel the day is almost over and I am basically useless, nothing will change if I get high. I go and buy some marijuana edible legal, eat it and go back home. I act like I am working while staying high, so my parents wont know. Many times, I just lie that I have a meeting and shut off my door, lie down and masturbate like twice or thrice in a day. As I get high, I also overeat and buy a lot of junk food and chocolates. Then, I spent the rest of the night till 23 am doing all this and watching office or Youtube. I feel totally exhausted and go to sleep. Then, I wake up next day exhausted at 10 and the cycle goes on. I also feel pretty dumb as I have almost no progress on my thesis. My professor thinks that I am smart but I am not. I just slack and slack and come up with some excuse for not doing the work. I just make some dumb and vague presentations an hour before the meeting. From last two weeks, I havent even done that. I just make some excuse and try to portray myself as the victim. I have one more semester left for my thesis and I think I should just quit. But I cant because then how will I pay for my loan. I am also not getting any internships, how the fuck am I supposed to get a job. I thought maybe Ill start a PhD degree as I am not really getting anything else and Ill at least get some stipend regularly if I get the scholarship. My chances of getting the scholarship are highly dependent on my honours thesis and I seem to be doing a very bad job till now. I have to submit a draft of a literature review on Monday rn its Saturday night which will be of around 15 pages and I havent even started yet.",
    "Every night just before drifting off to sleep, I'm overwhelmed with feelings of self hate and guilt. It spikes in me just before drifting off to sleep, like I was watching my life in a movie but then I suddenly realize its real and I am overcome with fear, dread, embarrassment, and guilt, like Im driving a train off a bridge or something. Could it be a brain tumor pressing against some part that controls these negative flight reactions? Why am I feeling these things flood into my brain right before drifting to sleep?",
    "My (24) boyfriend (30) told me having a child is the only point of life and if he found out he was infertile, he would kill himself. Cross posted in rrelationshipadvice because theyre all telling me to break up with him and not offering advice for the helping him not want to kill himself part.... I dont know what to do. Ive been dating my boyfriend for just over a year we had been friends with benefits for 3 years before that, so weve known each other a LONG time and we discovered early on that he wanted children and I didnt. We decided to keep seeing each other but open the relationship since we knew it couldnt be long term and we both could look for other partners. He turned 30 this January and we broke up because he wanted to start looking for a partner to have children with but we got back together two weeks later because we honestly love each other a lot and love spending time with one another. Plus then quarantine happened, so I assumed we would be able to continue as is to keep having each other to comfort and love when its basically impossible to start dating new people... Recently when Im not spending the night with him at his place, hell get extremely drunk and sad and not tell me. He texted me this morning that he got drunk last night and called a girl he impregnated 4 years ago who then got an abortion. He said he had to come to terms with the fact that he couldve had a four year old child now. Today I called him and hes been drinking all morning as of noon and he was watching bojack horseman and crying. He says the only reason hes depressed is because he doesnt have a child and the only reason he drinks is because hes sad that he doesnt have a child. But he loves me and is sad because I have the ability to change my mind and decide to have a child but i wont. And so naturally i said, oh but you could decide to not have a child and be with me forever, why is the impetus only on me? Then he said having a child is the only reason to be alive. He wants to see me pregnant and watch our child go to school and comfort them if they got bullied etc.",
    "Therapy is too hard i don’t know what to try next because there is nothing out there that can help me. Its way too difficult. I cant do anything im supposed to be doing. I cant take deep breathes when im feeling anxious because it feels like im suffocating myself. I cant let something go because i dont understand what that means with thought because reoccurring thoughts are always present. I cant get past anything because my mind is too fucking powerful and only wants to feel terrible. Im useless, hopeless, amp this is all pointless. Im at rock bottom and theres nothing left to help me. I wish i could just give myself amnesia so i could start fresh, because i can never start fresh because of all ive experienced",
    "Losing all hope Ive always struggled with depression, anxiety, alcohol abuse, and body image issues. Ive not had an easy go but always tried hard to better myself and get well. I got sober 1.5 years ago, am in therapy, regularly practice yoga and meditation, take antidepressants, get plenty of sleep, eat well, the whole fucking thing. I have a wonderful supportive husband whom I love, and with whom I had looked forward to building a life and having a family. And yet my depression still remains. In the last year, I have studied philosophy and spirituality and religion and cosmology and neuroscience and evolution and the more I learn the more I am convinced there is no benevolent god, the universe is random and absurd, and life is essentially meaningless. There may have been a creator entity, but its far removed from humanity. I recently watched True Detective and the main character says, I think human consciousness is a tragic misstep in evolution. We became too selfaware. Nature created an aspect of nature separate from itself. We are creatures that should not exist by natural law. We are things that labor under the illusion of having a self, this accretion of sensory experience and feelings, programmed with total assurance that we are each somebody, when in fact everybodys nobody. I agree with this statement entirely and had never heard anyone say it so succinctly. I have felt an urge to try and find some meaning in the world and in my life, that maybe I could climb out of the hole of depression someday, in many ways because of my husband. Until now. My husband is leaving me. He just started his dream job a few months ago, and hes suddenly decided he wants that more than me. That he wants to throw his whole life into work, and doesnt want to be married, or have a family, anymore. Note He is not leaving because I am depressed  he is leaving because he doesnt think he can be a good husband for me while he does this job, and this job is more important to him than I am. This pain...its just not bearable. It cuts to the heart in a way that is not describable.",
    "My twin brother (turning 19 soon) is depressed and won't get help. What do I do? Title kind of spells it out but heres more details My brother was diagnosed with depression in junior year of high school. It seemrd like hed been suffering with it since middle school, though my family and him didnt recognize the signs then. Since then hes gotten better and it feels like I actually have a brother again, but its not easy. Lately he got his medication raised, but has been sleeping more, feeling no motivation, looking sad, having a hard time focusing. Im currently out of state for college we are freshmen and hes staying home with our parents. His GF contacted me recently and said shes worried that his depression is getting worse. He doesnt tend to talk to me about it so I believe her. Thing is he has access to a psychiatrist but he says they cant help because I dont tell them anything and doesnt really answer why he doesnt actually talk to them. We suspect he has anxiety too but that hadnt come to anything yet His school offers free therapy which Ive taken advantage of at my own school but he doesnt take it, nor thinks he needs it. Im extremely afraid im going to lose him and his gf and I dont know what to do. Weve talked about getting him committed but we arent sure how or if that would actually help since hes already isolated he hasnt made friend at his new school yet Does anyone have advice??? Please help, I dont know what to do.",
    "I need help, TW SuçI∂e I cant feel safe anywhere, and hearing and reading what people are saying about me, about my nudes, about my private conversations with people just makes me hate life even more. I feel so ashamed and embarrassed, not of my actions as much as the fact that the whole word had to find out about it. I know youre thinking, this kid is in school, still a teenager and probably just overthinking it, but I literally cant go to the city center without fearing for my own life. I live in one of the biggest cities in the world, Ive lived here since forever and I know how big it is. I didnt think it would get this far, but it has. There is not one person I know that doesnt know about this. I cant have any friends here because everyone judges me and no one can ever see me for who I am, they even found ways to get to my friends abroad. I have nowhere to go, and no method of escaping the thoughts I get. I get mad at the world and I want to take revenge for all the people that hurt me but then I realize I could never possibly do that so then I feel powerless, just like how I felt all those other times when IT happened to me. So then I get mad at myself, and I make myself believe it was all my fault, and this leads to a cycle of self harm which very quickly develops into a fine line between life and death. Thank You for reading. Any replies will be very much appreciated. best regards",
    "Time for meds? Hi. Question if anyone could help me. Im considering finding a dr and asking for this drug. BUT. I always thought that antidepressants or for people that were depressed for no real reason. It was simply a chemical in balance and no matter what was going on in their life good or bad they were depressed. Thats not me. But in the last 18 months, my mom has been diagnosed with dementia and majorly spiraled and theres a lot of insane sadness and anger and abuse that comes with that, my stepmom was diagnosed with colon cancer has had two major surgeries and is on her second round of chemo, my dad is of course a nervous wreck and hes already a hypochondriac overweight. The pandemic closed down my entire industry and career and I had to move cities back home to help my sick family so I have no friends here and no employment in the career that Ive been extremely successful in for the last 30 years. I finally found a boyfriend that I really loved and thought everything was going well, but we had two miscarriages and it went downhill really fast and we wound up breaking up a few days ago. My 16 year old furbaby is dying and the boyfriend took our dog. I also lost a couple of jobs that I really wanted and I really could go on and on about the nonstop bad things that of happened. I am able to get up in the morning and function and go to my few little jobs and hang out with my family and take care of them. But I am extraordinarily sad I cry multiple times a day. I had my 40th birthday this year and Im terrified Ill be alone and childless forever. I had a prescription for Valium and I have some left so I have been taking one of those in the morning and it may be helps a tiny bit. Anyway I guess Im wondering if I take an SSRI if it will make any difference if I dont really have a chemical in balance Im just currently having a really shitty life and none of those things are gonna change anytime soon. I did start talking to a therapist on an app but Im not sure I like it and may have to find one in person soon. Anyway. Should I take an SSRI?",

    "Just sadness Often times I just feel down and I have no clue why. Like I have friends and a supporting family but I barely talk to any of them when Im feeling down. Just an hour I talked to a friend i meet online and she told me to try new routines and try to change my mind set from everything right now is useless and nothing matters to something else she never told me. But the thing Is that I cant just change my mind set and that makes me even more sad because I tell myself I cant be better and almost everyone are better than me. But when I meet someone that isnt better than me I say bad things and push them away to make them feel worse. Also recently I find myself starring into nothing or a mirror and just thinking what would happen if I would die and who honestly would care. Also also when I think about this sort of stuff I dont cry or do anything physical like that I just get sad and keep thinking.",

    "Need Help / Afraid to get labeled The stigma with mental health is strong. I know I need help, I have overwhelming thoughts of suicide and dispair, have battled eating disorders for a decade, am in a toxic relationship, have social anxieties in crowds and am a survivor of sexual assault. The problem is... I dont want to get labeled by my insurance company with all of these for the rest of my life. I worry that once I seek treatment and am 100 honest the diagnoses list will be long. I am functioning  maintain a promising career, friendships for the most part when I doing go MIA, and am physically healthy. Id say 7580 of the time Im living a normal healthy life, but that other 2025 is dark and frankly scary.

    "Why can't i ask for help? Hi. Im a twenty year old man currently failing university. Well, Im pretty sure Im failing. Ive given late handins for a lot of my projects, not done other projects properly, and not handed in some other projects all together.

Hell, right now Im swinging back and forth between asking a bunch of internet strangers. But I feel like Im going crazy. Every time I make up my mind to go tell my mom or my sister or my brother about these things, I convince myself out of it. i tell myself that these problems arent that big of a deal, that Id only be disturbing them my sister recently had a baby, so shes spending a lot of her time taking care of him that these problems arent problems and that I just need to get off my stupid lazy ass and do my work.

    "SO says it's depression linked. How to stop being too much? Hello Lengthy post, so Im sorry in advance if I waste your time, I am diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, however I believe it doesnt affect my day to day life enough to claim anything because others have it worse and most likely would be a waste on me anyway. When Im a member of a team, I feel too insignificant in comparison to colleaguesteam mates to ever say or put in any input. I have explained to others that I see it as If I have to work really hard to keep the job, and they can chill  lounge around and still keep the job thats equal to mine, they must have more value than me, therefore I have to try harder and respect them as my superior. My managers and colleagues say Im too much and oldfriends have ended friendships due to me being too nice. At parties and gatherings, I decide to stay quiet because I believe Ill ruin the entire night and I find it easier to seek out those that arent enjoying themselves to then go over, give them a bit of social motivation, make myself a laughing stock for them to laugh with their new friends and allow them to enjoy the night from then on without me intefering and potentially making it worse. I have been told all my life I am too much, or just too something, but its more of an insult now, even if it is said with positive intention. I just want to be enough. Nothing more, nothing less. This has come around due to my mother saying I would have done so much better in my life if I didnt focus on helping others so much, but I didnt even realise I was focusing. She tells me Im too nice about once a month. After talking to my current SO, she says it is depression. Thank you for your time, and sorry for wasting time if you read this and dont know how to help, OQPATY",
    "I don't have anything, no future and just.. yeah. I dont know where to start so I guess I give my life story. My father left me as a baby, and my mother lost custody at some point. Therefore, my grandparents had gain custody of me. For the most part, my early childhood was normal until around a certain age I was molested by an older female family member that had also extended to one of my female neighbour doing the same thing. At the time, I did not understand this or knew anything, but they as did. This didnt impact me at first, I was too young to understand, but as I got older I was lashing out a lot more, mainly to the female gender. At first, I didnt realize this, and Ive never told anyone what happened either. I felt ashamed, scared I get in trouble and no one would believe me. ampx200B As years went on, I grew to be more of an oddball person, an outcast among my peers. I did not get along with the female gender, and I didnt care until I hit puberty. Around this time, Im still super awkward and bully by everyone. I didnt have many friends, maybe 23 and this stayed until high school. Up until this point, never had a girlfriend and didnt know how to approach any girl for it. My selfconfidence is long shot with abandonment issues. Most of my family thinks Im gay and Im still bullied. ampx200B Additionally, to all of this, I have developed depression. As a teenager, I look around and see people hooking up but not this guy. At home, I had several relatives just killing my confidence, saying I was gay saying I would never amount to anything and so on. I also have , and my family stopped getting medication for it. So now, even at school, Im struggling, staying in one spot in subjects Im not a huge fan? Yeah, it was not great, and I ended up skipping a lot. To this day, I cant ever get any medication for it either, but I save that little later.",
    "Nothing feels good 22M. Literally nothing feels good. I spend my day solving tediously difficult problems with little resources and poor instructions. Hours of frustration. Eating is just another chore that doesnt bring any joy, unless I eat bullshitjj foods in which case again it will make me feel even worse than the little pleasure it brought me. Masturbating is basically a desperation attempt for something to feel good but honestly its just lack luster, there is no real desire. And if I watch porn it will feel good, but I dont because porn will make me feel even worse after. There is no emotional support from anyone, no one cares about a young mans feelings. Finishing at the gym makes me feel a little good, but its fucking exhausting and the energy and effort I put into it feels as shitty if not more so than the little dopamine I get after. I think this is where my problems with women come in. I want them badly, because sex with women feels awesome. Having a woman around is validating and feels awesome. Cuddling feels awesome. It feels like a woman is the only thing that can bring good feeling into my life without having an immediate and often worse downside. And I know this is problematic thinking. Everything just feels shit. And everything that feels good will make you pay.",
    "“I Don’t Care What You Think… This Is Between Me And God Now.” I have always looked up to my older cousin, Jim. He was truly one of the three men I admire most credit Don McLeans American Pie. And then, as if my current struggles with depression havent been bad enough, this week he tore me apart over a situation that he was completely ignorant about. He took one persons totally distorted version of events a diplomatic way of saying that he believed someone elses delusional lies and wouldnt even consider my side of the story. I tried so hard to get him to understand what I was doing and why. But he just wouldnt listen and continued to so very unfairly condemn me. Jim hurt me so badly. And he broke my heart. I was at a loss for what to do next. Then I thought about what my Dad would say in a similar situation. He wasnt a very big man physically, but he was one tough little SOB. And though he passed three years ago, I still find comfort and inspiration from his words of wisdom. So I told Jim that Ive given this situation a great deal of thought and prayer. Im doing what I believe is right. And if he doesnt like it, with all due respect, I dont care. This is between me and God now. Jim had no answer. And his abusive attacks stopped. Thanks Dad.

    "Help with meals I have trouble eating. Hardly anything tastes decent enough to eat. Im a picky eater in general and when Im depressed I cant even make chocolate a favorite palettable. Often I starve just because food is so unappetizing. But I have to eat, especially at work because I become emotional and cry in front of clients. To complicate matters, I just dont have much energy to expend in making a complex meal or the know how to do it. Any recommendations for something I can take to eat at work? I have done sandwiches, ramen, and shakes, but the sandwiches get boring, ramen tastes bland, and the shakes arent filling enough if they taste decent at all.",

Maybe I can improve my life and be happy! And Ill go to the gym for one day, or run, or try to learn something new, but thats short lasted. The second I complete the task all I can think is. Whats the point? Im probably going to die anyway, so why spend time improving myself? I honestly have no will to even live life, all my energy is spent just existing by distracting myself and spending money on stupid shit just to forget about life. I feel stuck in purgatory.

But then the reality of having two kids and a fairly oblivious husband creeps back in. I tell him how Im feeling, but it always feels like he thinks Im just whining or feeling sorry for myself. He kind of helps with the kids,but usually I have to ask. I am getting to the point where I feel like if I have to ask for help with the same shit every day, it isnt even worth it to ask. Ive also explained that to him. Things get better for a few days, maybe a week, then we go back to me having to ask again. I love my husband and kids, but Im at a breaking point.

    "16 year old struggling with depression and drugs Hey guys, Im 16 years old and I have had alcohol a few times, and it used to be somewhat of a problem for me. When I was 15, I only had alcohol about once a month, but I always fantasized about it, and when I had it, I tried to have a lot. I was really really depressed back then, and I have tons of selfharm scars and a few suicide attempts. And now, Ive gotten extremely depressed again. My exbest friend really victimized herself and said terrible things to me, stuff like that our whole friendship was based on lies and that Ive hurt her in ways that she couldnt imagine. This is due to lies that her abusive boyfriend had been feeding her, and he is a really bad person and talks trash about her so much and spills her secrets and doesnt have morals. I snapped when she was saying some really hurtful stuff to me and I told her everything her boyfriend did, which I think led to her saying those even more mean things to me. She ended up basically blocking me on everything. I went to a party yesterday and she was there and I felt so disconnected and lonely, and I vaped for the first time in a while, and there was a box cutter and I went to the bathroom to cut myself and I just felt so much better. Ive also been fantasizing about alcohol so that I could stop feeling. i have tons of goals for college and life, and I dont want to sound stuck up but I have pretty good chances at a top 10 college if I keep what I have going. But this has really clouded me, that someone who knew so much about me just rejected me like that and treated me like that and I just want to stop feeling. Does anybody have any advice? P. S. I promise that I wont be pming anyone to stop me from harming myself or anything like that. I would really appreciate real, actionable steps that can help me just forget about this situation and go back to working hard. For example, Ive heard that meditation could be really beneficial, and has anyone here tried it?",
    "Breaking up gave me depression.. and I want to speak my mind.. please be nice. I did not think I would end up this way. Drowning in selfpity in my room creating a post on Reddit because I cant express how I feel to anyone. Im just hoping this venting post could make me feel slightly better. Im not looking for pity, I just needed to speak out my mind. It was a 4year relationship, I broke up December 2019, Its been months. Ive done all I can, move to a new country, try a new sport, meet new people, and many more. I cant say that things did not get better in time, because it did. Time heals all. It helped me move on and lose most of my feelings for her, but it left a pretty nasty scar on me. So if time heals, whats the problem?? I dont wanna be a whiny prick, because we all go through breakups, and my situation is certainly not harder than anyones situation in this world. I just need a place where I can speak out my mind and not be judged. I dated a girl that I idolized, I see her for the angel that shes not. I was blinded by my feelings, and I see that now. Dont get me wrong, she was wonderful, loving, caring, and it just didnt work out. Around August 2019, we moved from our hometown to different countries for University We started an LDR. After our 4th year of dating, she started changing. Id like to believe that it was the people that she surrounded herself within University because I have never seen her act this way. When November 2019 came, she started doing something that ruined me. She would go out drinking and kept it from me, she also started ghosting me for days. I was not used to being ghosted because, throughout our 4 years of dating, she has never done that. And really, being ghosted by her ruined me so much. I started getting panic attacks. Initially, It was once every two weeks, then it became once a week, then it became 23 times a week. Eventually, she broke it off in December 2019.",
    "I'm 25y/o female from India. My depression keeps coming back in waves that pushes me into a full blown breakdown every few months. I don't know what to do. How do I get better? I have struggled with depression for a few years now. I live in a conservative family and my childhood was toxic, abusive and lonely. Things keep coming back to me now as I grow older. But Ive learnt to use my coping mechanisms and get better every time I start to fall into the darkness. However, two months back I had to deal with an abusive episode at home and I have not been able to bounce back. Im jobless. Im preparing for a competitive exam that requires me to study for at least 10 hrs a day and clearing it will mean freedom for me. All other options I have dont lead to freedom for me. Ive invested the last two years of my life in this and now the exam is just five months away but I find myself unable to even get out of bed on most days. The best day Ive had in two months was when I somehow managed to meditate and study for 3 hrs. Im fed up struggling and Im losing hope. But I want to get better and I want to be able to function and meet the demands of my life right now. I dont have the money or family support to consult a professional for help and so Ive come here as a last resort hoping that someone will be able to show me a light. I want to get better so bad. I believe its possible for me to create the life I want. Im just unable to see a way out of this darkness. Please help. How do I get better? What do I do to be able to stop feeling so lost and study?

    "Almost 20 years of social anxiety, how do I go on? So Im trying to get over social anxiety for almost 20 years now, 18 of them spent running around from one therapist to another and nothing helped. Im going to another psychiatrist in a few days, and while I was the one to set the appointment I still feel theres no point. I tried CBT, pills, and was once arrested and voluntarily hospitalized for making a dangerous post. Is there anything specific I should say to the therapist? At this point they just send me to a different psychologist every time but I somehow manage to be too hard for them to get through to. I. E. one psychologist, every meeting, asked what are you thinking about as I was staring at the carpet waiting for them to speak, my answer was always simply nothing, as it really was nothing, I just shut off thought if theres no conversation, and it went like this until I got hospitalized where the psychologists in the hospital told me to stop making appointments with her. At any rate, 18 years of therapy, my social anxiety can probably be compared to selective mutism with how severe it is, what do I do? Overall, I quit my job with no desire to find a new one, lost interest in most of my hobbies, lost interest in improving myself because it didnt make me feel better at the end lost weight, listened to 40 books, tried out MMA, tried singing lessons, went to the gym, worked at a hotel to try and get my social anxiety solved, reconnected with old friends and then lost the connection with them after burning out. I know of 0 people that went to therapy and claimed it helped them. Every single one that I asked said its just a scam and at this point I can only agree, the success rate is just too low to justify wasting time on it, especially since I already wasted 18 years.",

Her mother genuinely blames her phone for her problems, even the aches.

Like any other 16 year old guy I want to have sex, but I dont want to just do a hook up or a one time thing with someone who doesnt mean anything to me. I really only want to have sex with someone Im really emotionally attached too, and I also want my first time to be with someone else who hasnt done it yet. I kinda just assumed that sex would come in its own time until I broke up with my girlfriend about a month ago, where now Im being told that I should avoid relationships for the sake of my mental health. She was also the one who demeaned me for not having had sex before and sorta the reason I need it to be someone elses first time too. She basically made fun of me for not having had sex before, and I never really cared about losing my vcard, but now Im thinking about how belittled I feel knowing that I havent had sex whereas many of my friends have and now I notice all of them sorta expect me to have it as well, and even though I want it to be special and real they still see me differently for not having had it some contextmy friends are also fucking nerds and it is beyond me how any of them have had sex yet.

    "\"Paying for happiness\" - anyone else? Some quick background I have struggled with anxiety and depression for much of my adult life I am 43. For many years it was lowlevel and manageable, with occasional flareups, but an extremely traumatic event three years ago triggered a period of major depression in my life that I am still dealing with. I am very highfunctioning  most of the people in my life probably wouldnt even know of my struggles if I wasnt very candid about them  but it can get really, really bad sometimes. I have gone to therapy for over 15 years now and for the past few years have regularly seen multiple therapists. I was on various SSRIsSNRIs over the years but they never did much of anything for me and I have been off all meds for about 14 months now. I did GeneSight pharmacogenomic testing recently and it turns out that I have significantly reduced folic acid conversion which is apparently a common characteristic of people with major depression and so I started taking folinic acid supplements a little over a month ago to try to help with this. No noticeable improvement yet. I have also been doing psychedelicassisted therapy for about a year now, which includes weekly talk therapy with a strong focus on processing childhood traumas, reintegration, IFS internal family structures therapy, and the like. As part of this therapy, I have done 5 journeys so far. This has been the therapeutic regimen that I have felt the most growth and progress from, but I am still plagued with lots of issues. I really feel like Im throwing everything but the kitchen sink at my depression plus stuff like meditation, exercise, sometimes yoga, etc. etc. but nothing every really takes. I have noticed a pattern recently where when I am able to experience true happiness which is fairly uncommon for me  not just feeling pretty okay but genuinely feeling joy, having actual fun, etc., I will inevitably experience a comedown within 13 days. And the better I feel, the harder the comedown is. It is like getting high on a euphoriaproducing drug and then having the inevitable crash. It is as if my body and mind HAVE to revert back to a depressive norm, like a rubber band snapping back the higher I stray from it, the more intense the snapback.",

The stress of everything changing hit me hard and I admit I stopped showing him any affection. I hate myself for it, we argued ALL the time.

    "What to do when you notice yourself slipping back into depression? Ive had depression from 20152017 but never went to therapy. It got better because of a good network of friends and living with someone who motivated and helped me get through it. Now I feel like Im slipping back into old habits. For context I had covid last Christmas. Since then I struggle with fatigue, tiredness, lung problems and my thyroid. I havent found a doctor that was able to help me yet. Everybody dismisses me because there is no cure for long covid symptoms. I got an asthma spray and thyroid medication but it doesnt help. It scares me so much. I tried to get back into fitness and train my lungs. Yesterday I couldnt even finish jogging for 1,5km. Im 24, F, normal weight. I feel like a failure. Because I cant even run for such a short distance. Also Ive been quarantining for the last two weeks and ate way too much. My medication also made me gain weight. I feel horrible in my body. And I feel weak because i cant fight it. My boyfriend always tells me Im strong because I gave it a try but I cant accept that Im chronically ill and suffer every day and there is nothing I can do about it. It got so bad during the quarantine that I couldnt let him kiss me because I didnt feel like I deserved him. At the same time I want to hide how I feel because Im scared he will get fed up if Im depressed all the time. Its like a self fulfilling prophecy.

    "I don't know what to do at this point other than end it. Nothing has helped so far. He then insisted that if I did that, he wouldnt love me anymore. I was terrified of being abandoned by the love of my life, and sex was the only form of intimacy I knew at this point, so I didnt want to lose the only things I cared about. I kept doing it for him. It would make me cry and have panic attacks and occasionally throw up, but he didnt stop. I kept telling him that it was okay because I didnt want him to leave me. I developed severe anorexia because of this. I havent told anyone about it because I dont want professionals to get rid of it. Its a comfort for me I need to be as skinny as possible. I cannot be fat or I will kill myself. I also dont have time to be hospitalized for something like this right now. I am in the midst of scholarship applications and making money for college. Now that I am skinny, I am severely paranoid that he loves me less and doesnt like the way that I look. He has admitted both of those things. When hes in a bad mood, hell insult me about how Im not sexually good enough for him anymore and that my body is ugly because Im so skinny. I dont feel good enough, because I clearly am not. He reassures me that he still loves me personality and my face but frankly thats really shitty, if you ask me. The fat fetish thing doesnt happen anymore, but Im not good enough for him now. Im too scared to leave though. He has been my best friend for like, a decade. I dont want to lose what weve had.

    "This is a cry for help... I spent the next 8 months completely depressed. I can describe my mood like instead of blood, some sort of black ink was being pumped into my vessels. I spent nights crying and punching the wall. I moved to another town for college. Dated 3 more girls but I couldnt love them and I still wanted that specific girl. I dropped out of college and moved back to my hometown to my family to start studying for the big test again and get accepted in a university. How did that happen? 8 months after my breakup, While I was spending my days and nights depressed as fuck, I saw something on Instagram. A girl from my hometown whom I had a crush on for a year followed me on Instagram. I saw her post and stories to know her better, and she was EXACTLY my type. Her taste in music, her beliefs atheist and her style and her face. She was kinda the one. As Persian names are not familiar to you, I refer to her as Jane. And, I refer to myself Jack. I started talking to her on Instagram, and we hit it off. I reached one of my girlfriends who knew her. And asked her if Jane is single. She said she got back together with one of her ex boyfriends, and that guy is a fucking douche. He had convinced Jane that their breakup was her fault and she needed to grew up. Jane is also 19, and the guy was 20. That guy was driving Jane crazy. He disrespected her in every possible way and didnt care. I saw that as a great opportunity that when they breakup again, I can date her and treat her the way she deserved to be treated. So I waited. But the next day, that friend told me that Jane asked her did Jack say anything about me to you? She said no, but told her that a long time ago she heard from one of her friends that Jack is into Jane. She told me that the moment she told that to Jane, Jane got very happy and excited, and told her that she has a crush on me too. I couldnt believe what I heard. I wanted her but she was into me too?",

This is the closest I can get to talk to someone as the real me. Please just dont ask me how are you? to then abandon me because it hurts so much I cant take it.",
    "Advice on being productive when you feel exhausted and done withe everything? I never want to get out of bed but I have to, Ive got my nephew to watch and also my uncle needs help with various things, and my mom as well, and I know Im expected to clean as well, and I have tons of errands that I have to run. But I dont want to do it at all. None of it. Im actually really tired. My doc has referred me to an infectious disease specialist and a rheumatologist but I just dont want to go. I have zero energy and it could very well just be depression. Ive been dealing with these thoughts and emotions for about ten years and have always been very high functioning to the point where if I talk about this to my family no one will believe me or will just say snap out of it. But Im literally so damn tired. No energy. Face on the ground, dont want to get up. I cant push myself anymore like I used to and Id like to dissipate into thin air at this point.",
    "I'm begging someone for support rn. Anyone I was wholeheartedly convinced she was the woman I was going to marry. Eventually, after I had gone to jail, she decided to leave me and fucked 3 of my best friends... at the same time. It was complete betrayal, and thats when I realized I was truly alone. No friends, no family, it really fucked me up. Thats when my anxiety started to peak. The last few years of high school, I was addicted to cough syrup and would go to school tripping every single day. It destroyed my social skills, and fucked up my mind permanently. Eventually, after turning 21, I turned to alcohol. For the last 4 years, Ive drank basically everyday. Im at the point where I just hole up in my room, drinking around 18  20 drinks continuously everyday. Nothing is more terrifying than alcohol withdrawal. Ive gone to the hospital on numerous occasions for it, and every morning and night Im absolutely convinced Ill die of a heart attack. My 2nd gf I met 4 years ago. Finally, shed had it with my addiction and irrational behavior, and she left me. The thought of her being with another man crushes me, and Im at my lowest point. I cant stop drinking, havent showered in weeks. I have alcohol withdrawals constantly, and I cant even rid myself of the pain because when I start to drink again, its constant vomiting. I have nobody, and she was the only one that I had. Id call her at the end of everyday, and atleast I had someone to back me up. Ik its so cliche, but really she was my only hope. Im just really at the end, and just need someone to tell me it gets better. My life has been aweful since birth, and I just cant find hope. If you took the time to read this, I really appreciate it. I hope someone talks to me",
    "Can depression make you feel like you lost feelings for your partner? I was dating my bf for 1.5 years and both of us were deeply and truly in love with each other. I could tell. He suddenly said he lost feelings because of his depression and he tried to get them back but it never felt the same as it did before. Is it his depression that is making him feel this way or is it reality? He said that he doesnt know how long it will take to fix himself and he doesnt want me to wait for him because it isnt fair for me. I love him and Im willing to wait because his parents are the reason for his depression. When he moves out he will def feel that baggage left from his mind. He even hates them and is upset that he has to stay with them the whole summer before college. He even got drunk with alcohol because of his depression. And he never did this before. Do you think he actually lost feelings or that his feelings are being concealed because of the severe depression? He said he did love me before and a part of him still loves me now. But then Im confused because he told me to move on because its not fair for me to wait. Like i really love him and thats why im willing to wait. And he even said he doesnt know about later when he moves out because he feels like he cannot be fixed at all. He said he is depressed to the point where nobody can fix him. He sounded extremely depressed which made me hurt because I wanted to see him happy.",
    "I took my best friend to Florida for a getaway in the hopes that it would help my depression. Worst. Mistake. Ever. Hi, first time posting here and Im kinda a wreck right now so sorry if the formatting is a bit off. So, Ive been struggling with very severe depression, and even suicidal thoughts. Ive been in touch with a mentor, and I suggested going to FL I live in Virginia, and I have family in Florida and she thought that would be a good idea, you know, get away from everything for a few days. So, I booked the trip and invited my best friend who will remain nameless to go with me. He quickly agreed especially since hes been on suicide watch for me for over 3 months and we got out tickets and all was dandy. Today, day 2 of said trip, Ive completely lost my friend to the Fortnite video game. Ive tried to do stuff with him, he politely declines. Ive tried to talk to him, but as soon as I get sick unfortunately, my main stress coping mechanism is vomiting, completely involuntary. I dont force it he goes ba k to the game and when I need him the most when Ive hit my lowest point moments ago he leaves. LEAVES!! Im at the end of my rope and I dont know what to do. I feel completely alone. Even my family all except my dad have used me out completely and taken to my friend instead. I dont know what to do, Ive never felt so alone while Im surrounded by 8 of my closest family members and my best friend. Please help me. I dont know how else to end this. Please help me.",
    "Letting my boyfriend commit suicide. Please help. When I think about him being dead I get so many instrusive thoughts about him not being okay if there is an afterlife  that hes lonely, scared, or in more pain that he was here. As illogical as it may be, I think about how he might be scared, experiencing regret, or in pain in his last moments  I think about how that will lie with him forever and hell never get to know that he is finally okay. I know it probably sounds extremely dumb. He says hes not scared of death, and that helps me slightly. Im in so much pain now, and Im scared of how much pain is to come. I think about the moment I find out that hes dead and how Ill just want to scream at the top of my lungs. Ive been suicidal myself for years now and I think this is what will push me over the edge. Im scared of that. I love him. Hes my best friend, and I wanted to spend my life with him. Hes lying in the other room right now, and I dont know how to manage when the day comes where I can no longer go and lie next to him and give him a cuddle. Im terrified if forgetting him. Im trying to make mental notes of his features, and smells, and little things he does. Unfortunately, derealization has made my memory very poor. Were long distance, and have had very little time together in person. Im from the US and hes from the UK. I dont think Ill be able to attend his funeral because I wont be able to afford to travel, and covid might not allow it anyway. Im not sure Ill ever be able to step foot in the UK again. About him Hes mid 30s. Hes been on disability his entire adult life. Being dependent on the government for money and housing is one reason he feels hopeless. He believes hes locked out of ever getting a decent job now and doesnt think hed be able to cope with one anyway. He doesnt like his living situation. Hes very pessimistic and misanthropic. He thinks he may be in the autism spectrum.",
    "I am getting paranoid I cant sleep no more since 2 days I have the feeling of being watched the whole time of something not human but humanlike. I am so tiered at this very moment. I flinch at every sound and getting kicked out of my sleep even its just the crackling of the wooden floor. I am afraid of opening doors because I am scared of opening doors, because I fear there is something in the room, waiting for me. It all started with one crappy horror movie which was not even scary. It was really bad with huge logical gaps. I even laughed at it in the first place. But now? It is like my brain was rewriting the story just to intimidate me. But every time I talk to a family member it is just like it never existed. But as soon I close the door it is starting all over again. Every time I think I can sleep now, I just get the feeling again if something is approching me and heading for my neck. Even right now Pls guys help me. I am so tiered. I cant think anymore.

    "Feeling at the end of the line I didnt confront the issue till I was 24 and a girlfriend that I used to talk to and sort of wanted something more were talking about our feelings and I just plained told her what had happened to me and she told me that something similar happened to her at a similar age, we cried and talked about it and other things, strangely even as we felt closer after this we went our separate ways being just good friends to this day she is married, lives in a different country and has a baby, after that I worked through my trauma alone with little success side note, there is a history of violent tendencies in the men of my family, both from my mothers and fathers side, and Im basically the mixed result. A couple years later I met my first long relationship girlfriend and as you can imagine I fell hard for her and spoiled her like crazy, she helped my reconnect with my father and I told her about my trauma and to my surprise she also was a victim, we both tried to get professional help within our means but only I got serious about it and kept going to my sessions, she said she was fine on her own and knowing how hard this was I let her take her own choice and just tried to be supportive when needed, needless to say it ended bad, near the end when we were about to move in together I tried to start a conversation about how we began getting together and how special she was to me, apparently I was the only one that felt that way because she told me that the only reason she kissed me and begun hanging out with me was because she felt pity for me, we had other issues like a poor sexual life and not enough time on her part for us, so after she told me about how we really had begun our relationship I felt numbed and after a few days in emotional hell I broke up with her, I listed all that was wrong with the relationship and told her that something that begins with pity cant have a future, I wasnt able to tell her that that was what hurt me the must, she never apologized and we went our separate ways, her family loved me and knew I was the good guy and I was the best for her and tried to help but never went passed of a small conversation with me, they were harder on her but in the end they are her family, I found out she also cheated later on and it was what killed the last pieces of love I had for her, I didnt confront her about it and we never spoke ever again, the pity confession destroyed my self confidence we were together for close to 4 years.",

She and I were both looking forward to this because she wouldve qualified for Medicare today. And we couldve finally gotten some help for some of her issues and some caregiving relief for me. Mom passed two years ago and Ive never been quite ok since. Its funny how stuff such as transferring her from her bed to her chair, bandaging wounds, and even cleaning up accidents is stuff youd end up missing after they are gone. Just to have them back. All this is added to Mom and Is dog, Harper, had to be put down in June for kidney failure. My last family. So, now its just me. The sole survivor of being a family caregiver for 13 years, to sift through memories upon memories by myself. And the weight of today is just a lot.

    "My girlfriend left me immediately after I began to talk about our relationship and what has been bothering me The past 5 months have been pretty damn great. I had an amazing girlfriend who was the first to actually seem to care about me. Little thoughtful actions here and there, it was so nice. But then i noticed a disconnect in her. It came out of the blue. Not wanting to be touched and becoming easily angered and frustrated with me. I brought up what i have been noticing and asked what she thought about it. And she replied something along the lines of im completely over this, bye. Just out of the blue... i cant comprehend what just happened. I dont know where this came from. I just think i wasnt enough for her, and she probably has better guys lined up waiting for her. Ive relapsed into my dark self. Shutting out everyone and not treatung myself well. I cant feel pain anymore and my mind is in a state of uphoria. Im at work now just staring into nowhere, no will to do my job or anything at all.

    "Downward spiral after being dumped by someone who was never even my bf Im 31 F and have never had a boyfriend. I feel defective. After about a dozen dates or so I get dumped or guys start treating me like shit. I just got dumped by a really great guy. He said he wasnt ready for a relationship. Yet he messaged me first online, we texted almost daily for over a month, and went on real dates. I feel like this was the nice way of saying he just isnt that into me. He even met some of my friends. He told me I was the sweetest girl he ever dated. Then why would he never want to see me again? I dont have much experience considering most people my age are at a minimum living with their partner if not married with kids. I cant figure out why Im so undesirable.

    "Depression after graduating university I graduated from university a few months ago and am in limbo back home with my parents. I am supposed to be applying for jobs but I feel completely paralysed with fear. I have always suffered from incredibly low selfesteem. My parents are really critical of me so I have started avoiding seeing them and just spending my time in my room alone. Friends are all busy with work and university. I feel incredibly low. I have not left the house in 11 days now and can barely muster up the energy to brush my teeth and shower each day. My days have no structure and I just eat junk food as I feel too lethargic to prepare proper meals for myself. Each day I wake up late 11amish and then count down the hours until 7pm when I can start getting ready for bed again. Getting into bed is perhaps the highlight of my day as it means another day of my life is over with. My mum just came in my room and told me I need to sort myself out. She finds it all pathetic and is angry at me. I get it. But that is not what I need. Can she not see that I am not well at the moment? I also have been suffering with anxiety. Everyday there is something new to worry about. Yesterday I thought I had breast cancer, a couple of weeks ago it was cervical cancer, etc. Even applying body lotion to my arms I am scared I am going to see a dodgy mole. I just feel so hopeless. But I get these brief moments of sadness when I think to what I was like this time last year. I was in university, surrounded by friends, top of my year, genuinely springing out of bed to go to university. I dont know how it went bad so quickly. I know I can turn it around. Sunday night I prepared a simple todo list to just look for jobs and identify three I wished to apply to. A simple task which breaks down the scary process of job hunting down to tiny steps but it is Wednesday and I still have not done that.",

    "I feel like no one understands me, and it makes me incredibly lonely When I was in school, I thought it would get better in my 20s. Im now approaching 30, but Im still not seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. I tried to understand others, to listen to their problems without judgement, and to give advice when asked. Ive been told that Im a good listener and a good friend. But when I need someone to talk to, no one seems to understand. Sometimes I am ignored, other times I am misinterpreted and even criticised. The more I try, the more I am misunderstood, and the more I feel frustrated. I tried to improve myself, to read books, to try to think more rationally, and to communicate more clearly, so that others can understand me better. But after years of trying, it still seems fruitless. I hate going out to parties, where everyone talks over each other, and no one listens. The more I socialise, the lonelier I feel. Its no ones fault, really. I have a sensitive temperament that makes me a bit out of sync, a little hard for others to understand, I know that. I cant change who I am, nor can I change other people. But this doesnt make the pain go away. I can feel myself changing over time, becoming more cynical, more critical, and less trustful. I know how counterproductive it is, but I dont know how else to cope. On some days I feel like wanting to end all of this somehow. I just came out of a bad depression, where I spent entire days in bed and even had suicidal thoughts Im feeling a little better now. Im thinking of going to therapy, but Im hesitant because of the virus going around. Im also thinking of moving to another city and start over after the virus ends of course, but Im not sure if this would help. Id hate to waste so much effort just to end up back at the same place.

    "Am I Disabled Enough? I latch onto my own escape in the form of my high school boyfriend. Im eighteen, 140 kilos and move out of the room I share with my sister into a unit with my boyfriend who, you probably guessed it, was abusive. over time he conditioned me to stay away from technology but the tv and Xbox, cut what few friends I had out, only family I could really see without some sort of manipulative guilt trip was my mother because shed drive me straight into his arms.

He had child exploitation on his Pc and planned to harm my daughter once she was born, sending photos and ultrasounds to prove intent. Oh but dont worry cause mummy was there to pick me up.

I go to therapy, I find a antidepressant that works, I clip out the bad and keep only those positive influences. I have Depression, anxiety and PTSD. I have a medical diagnosis of only the Depression so far but the others are being worked on in therapy. When my kid is five i start dating and just before shes six I meet a wonderful guy who really IS wonderful! I made my therapist check. He is very understanding of my trust issues and agreed to sit with me on sessions Now to the disabled part. currently, I am 30 with a seven year old girl and a eight month old girl. Im in a stable relationship with a solid partner. Due to Covid and rising Rents, we were forced to move in with his parents and His sister who live with his grandparents. So yeah four generations, nine people. one house.",
    "I dont love/like my mother and idk if the relationship is worth salvaging. Im 28m shes 49fTheres a lot of backstory here so ill try to sum up some main points for context. My mother has substance abuse issues all through my life. It caused me to live with my grandparents multiple timea in my life from 36 then again from 1116 til my grandmother died and i had nowhere else to go. I ended up living with her due to some medical issues for myself at the time i had to drop out of school.and get my GED and a job. She made me pay rent 250 a month full time 40 hours a week back then i was making roughly 280 dollars a week. Whatever pay rent no problem even though Id be more supportive of my kid going through a terrible time but whatever. I also had to pay for my own food and such. The problem was a lot. My room was storage for her and her boyfriend i literally had just a bed and the rest were boxes of junk the boyfriend who was a hoarder didnt want to throw out. On top of that he was a terrible person who would constantly bad mouth my mother, steal my weed and other things from my roomi actually caught him on camera and showed him and he still denied it to my face. One day he did it in front of me and i beat the shit outta him and i ended up leaving and sleeping on friends couches etc. Now at the time I wouldve fucking killed for my mother. So her picking him over me kinda broke my heart back then but it is what it is. Fast forward a couple years20 i ended up living back with her doing the same stuff but this time at least i had a room that didnt have junk in it. But the abusive boyfriend was still there and it was the same pay rent and. all of my food. She starts letting her friends from the methadone clinic she goes too stay in the house...for FREE. Another thing she been on methadone for like 13 years, thats not how methadone should work but fuck it im no doctor.",
    "I am close to snapping and destroying myself and everything around me I already cut myself today. I am trying to calm down the urge to just drag the blade across my throat.",
    "Depressed boyfriend left Last week my depressed boyfriend left me. Even at the end he was telling me how much he loved me. And he was anguished with how much he felt made me suffer and how he thought I would be better off with someone who could give to me . This is so hard for me to understand. I wouldve helped him in anyway possible and loved and supported him until the end of my days. Even if he couldnt give back to me. He said I made him feel safe and loved and happier than anyone else. How can I make sense of this? I ask that you help me understand the perspective of a depressed person on this. Its hard for me to understand why he would give up a source of comfort and love. I love him so much and hate to think of him alone and in misery. And then I start to hate myself because I wonder if I was a better girlfriend that I could have helped him and he would not leave me. The logical part of me says that I did everything I could but my heart doesnt feel that way. At the same time I loved him so much and he knew it. Any insight would be appreciated.",
    "What would be the best way to talk to my S.O. about getting help tomorrow when it's a really upsetting subject for her even though she needs it? Ok, so me and my S. O. are both 15, I am a male and she is a female if that helps at all. Recently, my S. O. has been getting worse and worse and blocking outgetting rid of anyone or anything that helps her or makes her happy and Im extremely worried about her. She took up cutting about 2 years prior, even back then I knew her and did all I could, but eventually it came down to me calling the authorities to save her when she threatened to kill herself one night and her parents sent her to a mental hospital for awhile, which yes, while it did make her stop when she got out for awhile the things she got away with and did in there are absolutely horrible and Im disgusted by the way mental hospitals go about helping their patients. So anyways, recently she picked it back up again, Id say about a month to a month and a half ago. Ive been doing everything in my power to help her stop and I got her to for like 1 maybe 2 weeks at most before an event occurred in which she got her phone taken away by her parents and started it up again because I couldnt be there for her. She also most likely has an eating disorder, I say this because one moment she is eatingsnacking just chillin, the next shes throwing it all up and going days on end without eating. Shes claimed it has nothing to do with being fat shes under 90 pounds but yet she still brings up eating like a pug or not wanting to get fat so I assume that may be her reasoning but it could be more. She tells her parents who are doing a very shit job at looking after their daughter btw that shes just not feeling well or she pretends to eat and gets away with it.",
    "I don’t know what to do and every day it just gets worse So Im a 17 year old guy and I was supposed to graduate high school this May but I decided to graduate early back in February because I had a really toxic high school experience I have a physical disability so people just harassed me or used me for personal gain by manipulating me. I live in this really small town where there is nothing to do unless you want to be stuck in life etc. anyways back to the point I got a job because I wanted to save money for college this fall and at this point this job is my distraction from my current state even though the job is boring I try to make the best of it my parents are selling our current house soon and are moving to the city and I just keep telling myself it will get better when we move but at this point I really dont know anymore Im stuck in a horrible town that theres nothing for me there I have no friends and Im stuck at a really boring job and I just dont know what to do with myself and I hate it I want Chan so bad this chapter of my life is over and Im ready to move on but Im currently stuck and its slowly just making me more and more depressed",
    "Am I the Only One? Hi, Im somewhat new to the Reddit community but feel somewhat comfortable discussing heavy topics. So, please please dont be mean. I have dealt with depression and anxiety for a long time now but just recently got diagnosed and have been getting help for it. To keep it short, when I keep heavy thoughts bottled up inside for too long I explode. For me, I started cutting a year ago but havent done it in a few months but prefer to hit my face. Ive done this for a while but not to the point of leaving a wound. However, recently Ive noticed that I leave noticeable bruises on my face. I cant control the rage and feel awful afterwards but then i want to do it again. When it gets to a certain point, Im suicidal and tend to somewhat blackout when I hit myself. I hate thinking about this but it happened recently and now I have a bruise under my eye. Im reaching out to see if anyone else does this. Every time I do this, I wear a lot of makeup or stay home because Im ashamed and embarrassed that I did this to myself. I havent told anyone besides my boyfriend, counselor, and doctor so I dont know what others think about this. Only a few people have noticed a bruise on one occasion when I was in the darkest time and automatically thought my boyfriend did something. I felt terrible and I wanted to punish myself more. My boyfriend is one of the few reasons why Im still here. Any opinions and thoughts would be nice. I just feel so lost and confused. Thank you.",
    "I ( 26 female ) have decided to take care of my severely depressed younger brother (20m ) by letting him move in with me last week and need some tips. He is 20, however never grew up or matured properly due to lack of socialization... Never experience love, only had friends before his teens and made virtual friends via his gaming on Xbox until this day... While my mom drank and my dad was aggressive all these years, my brother would go hide in his room gaming all night and sleping all day and hasnt left his room until child protective services took him out for 1.5 years. And they only did because I told them what was going on... Anyways. Fast forward and now he is finally with me. I want to be the best support but I havent stopped feeling anxiety since he moved in. Like I am not eating as well and I am worried this will make me feel isolated or ruin my other relationships  dont have many left haha but 23 but also worried for him too as he wont eat unless I tell him to, wont move his body unless I tell him to etc... Having him here reminds me of the misery of my parents and my childhood. Because he is unfortunately the result of a dysfunctional family. I dont want to turn into my mom where I cook and clean all the time  she is a functioning alcoholic but gets highly abusive when she drinks but still cooked and cleaned  even though I cooked for.myself growing up as Im vegan and she didnt want to cook vegan food for me when I turned 19. I want my brother to feel confident but he doesnt because he dropped out of highschool twice as a result of mental illness growing up. Before coming to stay with me he was starring to refuse food and had severe psychomotor retardation  cant get our of bed  and like I maybe mentioned before he has not gotten out of bed in a decade expect for when CPS got involved . I booked him an appointment with a family doctor on Friday  tomorrow  and I spoke to my own therapist who recommended me a program to recommend to the doctor for my brother.",

I have time off but no one wants to hang out or spend time with me. I just sit in my room lying and bad memories keep running on and on. I can hardly breathe many times. Just lay there paralyzed no idea whats happening in my head or surroundings. Many things working against me lately in life but theres no one to just help me with those. I dont know how or what to do. I just wanna die for once. I have seen so many rejections now need someone to accept coz its taking a toll on me. I cant sleep even tho I am so tired. The only thing that goes on in my mind mostly is how badly I wanna die. Just everything I thought about how Id like my life to be has completely fallen apart and there is no hope to fix anything.

I dont have anyone. My own family, the people I live with, have no idea who I am, and I dont want them to know, because I would be disowned if they did, so I isolate myself in my room all day. Its like everything is against me. I come home and do literally nothing for hours. I just have these terrible thoughts and I dont know what to do with them. I self harmed for a while, but my best friend talked me out of it. Its been hard to live like this. Having nothing, going nowhere, no idea what I want. And to make it all even worse, I just found out Im gay, so I have to figure out how to hide it from people who I dont want knowing, how to come out, and when. I just want someone to talk to.

    "Lonley and my own fault So I recently been in a very bad time noticing that my friends actually are very toxic when we have a fight they tend to hurt me on purpose with things I told them. or well forget to invite me to stuff etc. so I cutted some of them off and trying to reconnect to people that showed interest in me. But I pushed them away because i habe major trust issues because if my past. But they dont seem to be that interested which I can understand but it still hurt. And I do found a nice group of two peps to chill but of course they arent always available and even if Im hanging out with them I tend to feel lonley thinking about my past and stuff, not always tho it mostly happens when I see other friend hanging around questioning why they didnt invite me. Or why other friends dont look out for me. I know everyone has a life and is busy but why cant I be a part of it. I mostly think its my fault but I dont think always like that.

    "Brushing teeth before bed Im not looking for judgement, I know people should brush their teeth twice a day, its just something I struggle with. In the past Ive fell into pretty bad bouts of depression and in the process for some time I couldnt even bring myself to brush my teeth or shower. That was a while ago, not recently. Since then Ive been much healthier and Ive built a solid morning routine where as soon as I get up I shower and brush my teeth. But I keep struggling to build a bedtime routine as normally I just go straight to bed and crash out, sometimes even in my clothes, without brushing my teeth. Any advice?",

I feel like this post is such a cry for help just screaming someone teach me how to be a functioning human lol but like. I just feel like because Im depressed I take so long getting ready in the mornings, I move so slow and have so many things to do. So sometimes I just avoid getting ready and its honestly gross. but ok do you guys workout and then get ready for the day? Or do you get fully ready and then be productive and then just wipe off makeup and go workout then go the rest of the night without makeup? Do you brush your teeth before or after coffee? Is wet hair more acceptable than greasy hair? I want to start wearing minimal make up because when I do take the full two hours to get ready and make breakfast I feel so beautiful.

    "All I want - is my death I need to write my dissertation, and I cannot concentrate, because my thoughts are not at all about studying. Over the past six months, I started having mental problems, and I cannot find the strength in myself even to go to a psychiatrist. And on the one hand, I would very much like to forget her, because I know that we will never even communicate with her now. On the other hand, I am so afraid to forget her, because for me she was the center of my universe. Hell, really, if I really had the opportunity to kill myself, if I had a bad relationship with my family, if I didnt know that my family would not survive this, I would go and kill myself at that very moment, when she said she didnt want to talk to me anymore. What I really would like right now is some inoperable cancer just to slowly fall into the grave. Im 26, and I have never been fully reciprocated by one girl. I visited 8 friend zones. But the most offensive is this one, the last one. Because Im an idiot. I know that she could be mine if I was more persistent. Now, I look at myself 5 years ago and want to shout to myself Idiot! You ruin everything! Take a step!, But I cant, because Im not a magician. I dont think so, but I know that I will never be happy in my life. That I would work a job that I would hate until my parents were gone. And right after that, Ill just kill myself, because it wont make sense for me to stay alive anymore. My sisters by this time will already be married, and will be able to live without me. Over the past six months, my life has sunk to such a bottom, into such an abyss, where it has never been before. And in the last month my life has ended. Only existence remains. The man who hoped for the future, who had dreams and hopes, is dead. And I, an empty shell filled with regrets, pain and depression  for some reason still alive. All I want is to die. And I can never want anything else again.",

This is clearly not true. My parents being divorced already makes me depressed enough, then you add this, and tons of anxiety, you dont get a good result. In fact, you get the opposite, you get me.

    "Family crises Im 31. 9 years ago I met my wife in my small hometown in East Tennessee. I fell in love with her, but she was from Midwest Florida, and had a 3 year old son already. Soon after we met she got pregnant with my son. Growing up with a father that lived in Illinois, I knew immediately that I would do anything to be there for my unborn child. So, we decided to move to her home town in Florida where all of her family is, get married and start raising her first born and our new baby. Ive always had depression to some degree. Weve had a rough marriage almost from the start. So, weve slowly been drifting apart this whole time. On March 28th we started the day off with sex. I felt like a million bucks. As the day went on she said she was tired of being couped up in the house all week because of the Corona virus. She wanted to go to a hotel to get away I supported her decision to take some time for her self and told her she should go. Eventually she decided to not go to the hotel and instead go out with one of her girlfriends and her sister. I once again supported her decision. She left at 2pm. As I was at home with our boys playing in the pool making burgers for them and having fun I realized shed been gone for almost 6 hours. I started calling her and she wouldnt pick up, so I Facebook messaged her friend she said she was with, and asked her to have her give me a call. Her friend was surprised to say the least that I was contacting her, mainly because she wasnt with her. She finally called me around 830 after her friend contacted her to see what was going on. Caught in her lie, she immediately confessed that she had driven an hour and a half to go out on a 37 year old rich guys boat for a while. After their boat ride, they went to go get Publix subs in his 2020 Corvette. My wife works at a successful car lot, and this was one of her customers. she actually sold him the boat and the Corvette. He knows that shes married with kids. She swears they didnt do anything sexual.",

Ive never even looked at this sub, I just needed to find something because I have nobody to talk to so I used the search bar. Ive never admitted any of this out loud. Ive never typed them to anybody either, just in the memo section on my phone, where I keep a diary in case I end up killing myself. Im not technically suicidal, Im not trying to find ways to kill myself. I just want something to happen to me so I can just die. Im currently on a road trip with my kids two sons, ages 3 and 1 and my parents. Were on our way back to our home state, my husband is there. I want to get out of the car to pee or something at a rest stop and get hit and die on impact, I dont want anything to happen to my parents or my kids. Ive been having thoughts like this for a long, long time while walking or driving alone. I never have them when Im with other people. I have been diagnosed with severe depression, generalized anxiety, and PTSD from childhood trauma, and have gone to a therapist and a psychiatrist. I was on an antidepressant Zoloft but had to stop as it was causing me to have stroke symptoms. I feel like none of my friends give a shit. Im aware this could be my mental illness telling me this, but I cant help it. Nobody ever asks me how Im doing, and I ask them every day. I message or call them immediately after they post a concerning status on Facebook, check on them on anniversaries of loved ones deaths, etc. Nobody asks how Im doing unless I stop replying to them for over a week which I have done twice over the last year by muting all notifications from messaging apps when Im particularly depressed and cant handle anything else. When I post in group chats about something Im done or my sons have done, I feel like somebody always has something happen right then and whatever Ive shared gets ignored. Ive stopped telling people about my life and venting, and nobody has asked. Things have been stressful at home.",

    "Learning I have Alexithymia really fucked me up. Ive always accepted the fact that one day I will kill myself. I joke and say Im going to kill myself every once in awhile. Ive always felt empty and just figured that it was Depression and suicidal thoughts. I promised myself when I was little I would kill myself at 21, Im 23 now, Im on meds for depression and I go to a psychiatrist, I have a long term girlfriend who I can see a future with. However, that doesnt stop the fact that one day I will kill myself. I told my girlfriend I never want children or marriage because when I do kill myself itd be easier on everyone. I am getting a vasectomy soon so I dont have any dependents, Ive pushed people away, no, I forget other people exist because thats how much no one matters to me. A few days ago I learned that I have Alexithymia, which means I dont feel emotions. I never had a way of explaining how I feel until I found out what Alexithymia was. I have no feelings. I can not experience what I assume is one of the best things about being a human. I have no imagination, no creativity. I simply exist and thats it. Imagine playing a game thats in the first person. Thats my life, I just see stuff, I dont feel anything. Not to be cliché but I am nothing but a shell of a man. This really fucked me up, enough where I stare off, Im not very talkative and I get lost in my head that life truly is pointless. My girlfriend notices and shes kind of worried, she asked if I would be okay by myself before she left for work. I feel like this solidified that life is ultimately pointless, especially for me.

    "judging depression last night I seen this video of a girl saying the girl whos crying in the bathroom could also be the girl who hasnt changed her underwear in 4 days, all depression doesnt look the same. I quickly scrunched my nose and thought how how gross and didnt think about it again until later last night. I walked to the bathroom passed the mirror and realized I have been wearing the same t shirt and shorts for the last 6 days. I hate myself for being depressed and not being able to get of this. I hate myself because I cant even see the same person that I judged is me just judging myself.",
    "depressed piece of shit I am a young adult who lives in New York I grew up with fully supporting parents and friends, but that means nothing when your mental health is not stable. The last year of my life I have been battling with severe depression and anxiety, and was just recently hospitalized for a week in a psychiatric ward. At this point, I feel so incurable nothing has helped. I have seen my therapist for a year, seemed professional medical help, took the numerous amount of pills and have not felt the slightest bit better. Things have gotten worse than before. I have laundry piling up in the corner of my room and at this point I just pull out any clean clothes I can find in my dresser. Showers? HA even a short 5 minute shower seems to take too much energy at this point. AND I AM SO SICK AND TIRED OF HEARING THE SAME BULLSHIT LINES OF It will get better, and You have nothing to be depressed about, or Everything will be fine because it always works out. To be honest, my depression has just spiraled out of control at this point. I cant look at myself in the mirror and hate everything about myself internally, externally and mentally. I hate myself and the people I am hurting. I could have a good day, but at the end of the day my suicidal thoughts still sit in the back of my head. Sometimes I sit and regret not just doing it blade to my wrist and a family member walks in. I had the blade in my right hand, resting on my left forearm and I regret not ending my life there when I had the motherfucken chance.",

    "I just want to stop existing Im terrified of death and not knowing what comes after it, but I dont see life as something precious or valuable. All I see is suffering and endless hopelessness. I am losing interest in everything and I can feel myself slipping away. Its been like this for so long I dont know what happiness feels like and I spend my days drifting in a mixture of self loathing and numbness. Im so tired and find sleep to be my only escape. School on top of my struggling really exhausts me mentally and physically. Im scared to die, but falling asleep for a really long time just sounds so nice. Even then though, Id have to wake up and face the cruel reality that there really isnt anything to be happy about. And it hurts because I cant escape it. No matter how many nights I spend trying to cry the pain away its still there. I have no motivation to really change my life either though, I physically cant force myself no matter how much I want to, to do anything productive. I dont know how much longer I can do this, does anybody know what to do? Im overflowed with these feelings and I cant help but feel the only way to get some release besides sleep is to harm myself, even if I know its not going to help in the end. Im just done and I cant keep up with school or my relationships anymore. I need some advice on what to do",
    "My mom puts her boyfriend ahead of me and I’m losing my mind So no one in my nuclear family really cares for me. If anything they all have been my abusers at some point and just seem to take turns. My mom right now seems to be the main one. She has her boyfriend over who is a POS in my eyes thinks its ok to say the nword, asked if my best friend whos Muslim was going to blow up the gas station and I tell her that I dont like him and I dont think hes a good person. She gets all mad and says that I dont know him and I should respect him because she loves him and its been such a longtime since someone loved her like that. I feel like shes so fucking stupid and if I say her down to talk to her she would get all defensive and kick me out again. She always seems to place him before me which genuinely hurts and she seems to have no concern for me. She has this thing that she thinks is really funny where its her just yelling at me and tell me I didnt do something right, and I see everyone else look down. Our relationship is seriously strained and their relationship had issues around the same time. She ran to him crying on the daily, even driving past where he lives. I had to reach out to her. She yells at me all the time because hell talk to her and say that he doesnt feel like hes part of the family there is no family. Im always pushing for a healthier relationship with my mom and she puts him in front of me no questions asked. I already want to fucking kill myself, and I battle thoughts about my worth all the time but it doesnt help with my mom yelling at me for being disrespectful to him when I say something shes just not used to hearing. Im so angry at her and Im angry at myself because I keep letting her hurt me. This whole situation fucks with my self worth. I just cant seem to get to a point in my life where I am able to completely cut my parents off. Please help.",
    "Specific activities to ease loneliness and depression while living alone in the time of COVID? I 23F have been living alone since ending a 4year emotionally abusive relationship in October 2019. I loved my new independence, then quarantine hit. I went through another horrific breakup in March  he broke up with me in a truly cruel way the day before the shelterinplace order hit. My best friends have all moved 100s of miles away to be with their parents during quarantine. After 82 days of basically solitary confinement, I started hanging out safely with acquaintances in June and I visit my parents almost every weekend. Im trying dating apps, but the constant ghosting, mixed signals, and not getting matches is really bringing me down. I have had depression, anxiety, and OCD for 10 years but in quarantine its the worst Ive ever felt. I am an attractive woman, but no one wants to date me and everyone Ive ever dated has either been emotionally abusive or lied to me to get to my body. When I do meet someone who expresses interest, they inevitably ghost me. I just got a prescription for Zoloft because my Citalopram is clearly not working anymore. I am hoping to feel better on Zoloft, but I dont have much hope. A medication will not give me friends, or make men interested in me, or open up all my favorite places that have closed due to the pandemic. Because my depression stems from my unfortunate life circumstances, I am seeking advice on specific things I can do to pass the time and take my mind off of how sht my life is right now. Especially how I can meet other people and hopefully make friends. When everything that I love to do is closed, what can I do to make myself feel happy? BTW, I cannot watch television or movies besides documentaries because it is too painful to see happy people, even if they are fictional.",
    "Not sure if this is relevant but... here goes nothing I have a problem with asking for help. Especially from teachers and other important adults. I am a highschool student I am taking concurrent classes at our local college and the teacher, an adjunct professor, is very rough on highschoolers and she expects a lot from them. This is fine but were fast approaching the end of the year and my grades are slipping due to some stress and dysfunction in my family and friendships that I am struggling to deal with. I also have to miss a lot of class for highschool events and such. There is a possibility I will not graduate and that I will lose my scholarships for college. I need to get away from my family and make my own life in this world and I feel like Im at the finish line but this obstacle is in my way. I dont know how to approach this teacher. While she is a nice woman, I dont think I could handle it if she told me there was nothing I could do. I feel like a whiny child and could really use some advice. Thank you.",

    "Could anyone here help me with writing an email? I have been putting off my thesis for months after I told my promotor I have depression in March. I promised her to get back at it in September but I couldnt bring myself to work on it until today. I shouldve sent her emails explaining my situation but I keep delaying because everything related to my thesis triggers anxiety and turmoil inside me. Yesterday my promotor sent me an email which I dread to open. It took me a mountainous amount of energy, some tears, and screams to open it, and I found out that she was asking how I am doing and reminded me that my thesis is a part of a bigger project and that basically, I need to start working on it and update her. I feel guilty to the bones now. I know, this probably sounds very childish and desperate but could anyone here help me draft my email? I have the draft already but I dont know if the content is appropriate enough. My mind is so stupid right now that I dont know how to write professionally and how much I should share. If I can, I just wanna let her know that Im so anxious about working on this thesis.",

I was talking to a mutual friend of ours and I asked how she was doing without thinking. The news hit me like a truck, it felt like all the work I put in to slowly stitch my heart back together was for nothing. A week ago I was going about my life, happier than I had been in a long time. Now I cant even concentrate without thinking about her, about what her life has become without me. I know I should keep moving on, she didnt even have the decency to breakup with me in person after 4 years together, but it feels impossible with all the feelings that have come back.

    "My mother and I had an unsettling conversation in the midst of my depression, and I don't know how to feel... Okay, so I am teen 14M who is dealing with a lot of struggles. I have had depression for months, and I dont know what to do. I live in a smal part of a big town, which means I dont see many friends often, and Im the only one my age in that part of town. Thats bad from a start, but thats not whats triggering me... I had been dealing with my dumbass psycho ex, not able to see my gf, being bullied and cyberbullied. I have beaten myself until I bled, every day in the past 2 weeks, and I always wonder if life is worth living, and yet I still try to piece things together again. Yesterday, I had figured out that my past was a lot worse than I had originally thought, with reoccurring memories of childhood trauma. We were having a normal conversation about how I was doing at school as usual, but it took a turn quickly back to the worst childhood memories I had, which all I had forgotten until then. I had thought it was always peaceful back then since almost every childhood memory I had before then was happy. I even bring up these positive memories whenever Im down. And these memories came back. Heres what they were one by one in the order they happened The first memory, the only one I couldnt regain my perception on was one from when I was in preschool obviously. The last day I went to preschool, my mother was watching in the preschool because she noticed things werent perfectly fine there. Before it was over, a little girl who was 3 years of age, opened one of the metal doors and accidentally slammed her fingers in the doors. The tips of 3 of that girls fingers were cut off from that door and was bleeding everywhere. The staff was panicking, but they werent doing anything. They didnt call for help. They just stood and watched. The staff, also, were both 17 yearolds watching over 32 preschool kids which was illegal. My mother quickly took me out of that daycare and felt so bad for leaving me there.",

But that was fine, I had enough savings to get me through a month or two, I could find a new job. That was, I dont even know, three months ago? I havent even applied. I just...cant find the energy. I know I need help, I know Im really sick, but I just...cant move. Ive had the website for a local therapist open in my tabs the whole time one that I can email, because holy hell phonecalls are an anxiety nightmare even when Im feeling sane but everytime I go to reach out I just get paralyzed by anxiety and uncertainty, and I just cant find the will to muster through it. I havent gone back to selfharming but Im so afraid of ending up back in that place again, its been a struggle. I just dont know what else to do. I just dont know what I CAN do?!

    "Could you read me? I consent to him so anal sex with me. When the violence was over and started the sex it was awful. It was the most unsatisfying experience Ive ever had. I couldnt believed what I just did. I just ruined the only healthy male relationship that I had for a disgusting experience. I still didnt remembered what happened with my brother, but I tried to repress this memory as well. I wasnt successful. ampx200B Me, at 16, didnt saw any good thing in life anymore, and the memory of the sex that I had with my cousin was still in my mind. In therapy, I accepted that experience but it just seemed that something was wrong. Of course, it was around my whole life so it was very obvious Im gay. Right, Im gay. Mom Im gay. Dad, Im gay. World, IM GAY. Now Im gonna be happy. Except that I wasnt. So I decided Im just gonna be happy when I kiss a man. I kissed. Three. And I hated. Once I kissed a girl, but she humiliated me in front of the whole class and said that was the worse kiss ever. The other girl I was interested rejected me totally. So I just said you what, Im gay. I dont fucking care. I surrounded myself with gay people, feeling that I would feel part of something for the first time. I didnt. I wasnt interested in any man, except the ones that treated me badly and bullied me. Those one were straight. ampx200B I lived for two years as a gay man, that has never felt so unhappy in my life. Empty. The memory of what happened to me and my brother started to rise inside my head. But neglected it and just said its normal, boys do that. It was until the last year. when I was making coffee. I accidentally let it fall in my brothers body and, of course, he started screaming with me. At that moment, I just cried like never before. Since I was 10 I didnt cried.",

    "Student Burnout and Losing Myself on Antidepressants. Hey, junior in high school here. The final stretch of this semester in an allgirls private school has been pretty exhausting, especially with the high standards they expect there. Im currently and have been remotely learning for about a year in the pandemic and went on medication. Right now I just dropped down to 75 mg of Effexor due to feeling dead and totally unmotivated. My body feels like lead, my eyelids droop, and I just stare into outer space during my classes. I found myself struggling to pick up a pencil last week. I cant even look at my overdue assignments without feeling like I want to crawl back under my warm blankets and fall into a sweet, deep sleep. I declutter my space, eat, hydrate, and let a little sun in, but Im still very fatigued and out of inspiration. Months ago I could barely take care of myself like that, so am I just impatient? Should I just ride it out and try my best with school? Seems like my only option right now. I want to feel like myself and WANT to get my passion back for my hobbies. All I do is school and after that is just endless consumption of media scrolling on tiktok and instagram for hours. Im tired of feeling empty. I dont want to go off of my meds since I want to subdue any overwhelming anxiety while learning how to drive and getting my first job this summer vaccinated and taking precautions, of course. Any tips or advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading."
