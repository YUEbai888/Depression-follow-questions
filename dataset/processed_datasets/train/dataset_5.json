    "Am I dumb ? Hi there. It feels weird to talk about it. Its not very original but I hate myself. Not like a teenager phase anymore because Im already 25 and I feel like Ive never accomplished anything. Im not very pretty and Im kinda fat not like those pretty girls who are fishing for compliments, I truly am fat. Everybody tells me to move my butt, eat less, take care of myself but all I want to do is sleep, or die. I feel like I have nothing for myself. All my friends are drifting away from me because of their couple life and I still dont know if Ill ever meet someone Im important for. I live with my mom and my sister. My mom is sick and my sister is a manipulative piece of crap who gets what the fuck she wants and I cant help but feel jealous because I never get what I want and no one notices me. Guess its a vicious circle because it makes me more bitter everyday and more hating towards people in general because I fear their judgment or being seen as dumb AND unattractive. I feel so empty and aloneand then guilty for beating myself for this while people are truly suffering. Wtf is wrong with me ? Never been diagnosed depressive so sorry if Im not and you feel like Im making depression look unimportant or some stuff. Damn maybe I just needed to let it all out somewhere? Thanks for the time.",
    "Im 21 yrs old, have never kissed a girl, the loneliness is killing me Sorry for the rant So yea, it kinda sucks  I was never the popular kid in school really and honestly didnt have many friends back in highschool, and have only had 1 actual girlfriend I had 2 others during junior high but...you know...those dont count as it was junior high and they only lasted like 1 week each lol who had what ill call bad character traits for someone you want to have as your girlfriend. Ive come to terms with it and am fine with it since im in the adult world now and have more to focus on, however I cant help feel depressed as im going to be finished college within a year, going to be buying a 2 part house with my parents eventually and actually start my career and adult life but I cant ever seem to get girls to even look at me and its honestly depressing. Ontop of that even if girls were interested in me I wouldnt know how to read any signs or know a good way to ask them out  the closest I came was last year with a girl in one of my classes but I heard her talk about her boyfriend and that kinda put a stop to any thoughts about dating her around then. Adding to this im always feeling lonely most of the time, as pretty much all my friends in college have girlfriends or have atleast have had a better and more eventful relationship then me. Its getting to the point where im thinking to myself im just not one of those people persons because i generally work better by myself, and will end up growing old and alone except being that kind of person terrifies me because thats now how I want to live my life. Anyway I guess thats my first rant on here, I would appreciate any advice someone can give me to help stop the loneliness or be more of a people person, going to post this in the other sub and see if I can get any help there.",
    "medical mystery causing me depression usually antipsychoticswith SSRI help me a lot but its just been fucked lately, ive had one of my worst relapses ever for the past 11 days I just feel like im stuck in some alternate world of dissociation, i usually get a warning before this happens  an intrusive sensation comes on, and i focus on the feeling and suck it in, i than immediately surrender to this feeling and say yup Its happening again or if i try to fight away the sinking feeling, it gets deeper the discomfort and the dissociation goes into my head, than i get a weird feeling in my body, i dont know if it is in my arms or my neck muscles, but it sucks. Its highly distressing. I have diagnosed OCD. Am i going crazy? part of me just wants to take the recommended dosage for schizophrenia to make sure i am not actually schizophrenic. For 2 years my life was perfect, now its in crisis again, My damn GP said it will take too long to see a psychiatrist or get to see one, and he wants me to wait to see if the extremely small upping of my antipsychotic dose will help, which clearly it has not, it has been 9 days and i have still had an episode every freaking night, it all dates back to that one traumatic event i had in 2016, i wish that night never happened and i would forever be a normal happy person, instead i am now a fucked up crazy person. Apart of me wishes i had a bullet to just take the pain away of this sensation, it feels like i am talking to a bunch of ghosts on reddit when i ask this, people dont get this feeling follows me around, it is a part of me, a part of my brain that is actively seeking to hurt me and only the meds can block it",
    "Just feel nothing, despite a loving family and a girlfriend who wants a future with me Posting on a throwaway for a lot of reasons. Im numb to the pain, I wake up late because Im basically a bum who doesnt work and goes to online school. I bought a gym membership but get super unmotivated to go. It all started last year when I got laid off from my job at Disney due to covid, and the transition to online school. Ever since March of last year Ive been in my room all alone, my family worries and its so rare I leave my room sometimes they think I went out to eat. The only friends I got are my girlfriend and a friend from high school who I keep tabs with, hes the last person I wanna talk to about this shit. My parents dont exactly hate me, my dad is always supportive of me but sometimes my mom sees me as this bum whos just in his room all day, but deep down Im itching to just go out and be a productive member to Society again, Im just waiting for the day Im able to get back to normal. It just sucks being in my room all the time.",
    "My friend is suffering from severe depression and I want to help her but I'm not sure how I 17m moved to Houston from Toronto last January and I have kept in contact with one of my friends in Toronto 17f who is clearly struggling with her mental health. We stay in contact over snapchat and shes opened up to me a few times and Ive tried to be as supportive as possible. The last snap I got from her she said something about how shes not sure she can make it through the next couple weeks. Ive never experienced any mental health struggles as severe as what she is going through so I dont think Im in a great place to give advice. Ive tried to just listen to her and be supportive so far but it doesnt seem to be helping her much. The physical distance between us makes it even harder for me to see how shes doing as I dont get to see her at school on an everyday basis like I used to. What I can I do to best help her without being pushy? And are there any resources that I couldshould reccomend to her? Any and all help is greatly appreciated.",
    "Time for a second attempt Back in 2014 I tried to kill myself by overdosing on sleeping medication, but my mother was able to get me to the hospital and the doctors were able to save me. After my first year of college Ive decided I have no chance of getting anywhere in life and the person who I love will never love me back. Does anyone have any genuine advice for how to go about this? Im thinking about trying to overdose again since it seems the easiest. I dont want to permanently scar anyone on campus by jumping off a roof or hanging myself.",
    "Are anti-depressants worth taking? I 25m have been unemployed since finishing my MA for over a year now. Are antidepressants worth taking? My doctor offered them and I think Im going to look into a new therapist. I think I might have some sort of ADHD or anxiety instead but Im not too sure. I live in Canada so its going to be a few not that before I can see a psychiatrist. Im really struggling to apply for jobs rn. This is sort of killing me. Are antidepressants worth taking in your experience? Ive heard some bad things about them and Im worried.",

Yeah lately for the pass couple months Im just done with life just want to end it but its weird theres no emotions behind.

    "Loneliness is exhausting Hello everyone. Ive been dealing with depression for years now. My whole life Ive had a goofy personality, I feel as though it gravitated people towards me, but all for the wrong reasons. When life got real I felt like no one took me seriously. Ive been carrying trauma my whole life and its been affecting me. Im at a point in my life now where my friends barely even talk to me anymore. I have to basically pull teeth just to get them to hang outI hate to be negative but I really feel like life sucks rn. I just want friends and family that support me and check up on me. I can deal with everything else on my own with my therapist. But no one seems to talk to me about anything unless Im doing something wrong. Everyone knows what Ive been going through, even the attempt I had before. But it just seems like life goes on, I feel invisible. Like I said I really just want friends thatll get me out the house to go fishing or go on a hike and make me feel like I actually mean something to someoneI dont know what to do anymore.",
    "My girlfriend has depression So my girlfriend of 2 years has told me shes been struggling with depression. She has times where she wants nothing to do with me and she wont do hardly anything to take care of her self. I havent ever had this struggle so I dont know how it feels and cant really relate but I want to help her. She wont go to a doctor for it and Im trying everything to help her. She loves getting letters so I have written her one that helped but I dont know where to go from here. Im 23M shes 22F Im sorry if this goes against the rules I read them and didnt see anything about it",
    "My adult daughter makes me depressed We brought our adult 19yr old daughter up in a loving good home gave her everything. Since been a teenager all her morals have changed she swears is disrespectful tells her friends lies that we are awful parents she scams family and friends for money so she doesnt have to get a job. She rarely calls only if she wants something. She never even contacts he brother or sister. She is addicted to her phone. When she lived at home if we took it off her at night she would be violent attack at us. She quit uni. She hangs out with negative people. She always plays the victim mentality. She recently told me her friend is a prostitute but swear mum im not..i dont believe her she lies now. I feel so sad. I never thought she would grow to be this personality. She was a beautiful child.

    "I don’t know what I feel anymore I have been depressed since I was 16 years old I am 19 now last year was very hard for me, I had a suicide attempt, which caused me to have depersonalization. my depersonalization lasted a few months and all year I suffer from depression. I adopted a kitten and my depression disappeared a little, every night I cried myself to sleep but with her I sleep better at night. A new years purpose was to be more sociable, make new friends, go out and do everything I didnt do because of my constant depression. everything was going well, I even met and I had a date with a guy who made me feel things I hadnt felt in a long time. but now none of my friends talk to me, not even the guy who used to talk to me every day until midnight. they even lied to me to exclude me from plans. I try to talk to them but they ignore me. Tbh I felt sad about it, but now I dont even know what to feel, I dont feel anything, Im not happy, Im not sad, Im not angry, I feel disappointed and I dont want to go back to my depression lifestyle.",
    "I genuinely wanna be happy. Tips? So I have severe anxiety and depression. Nothing traumatic happened to me, a lot of my family has this. I take medicine however, I dont want to rely on this all the time. Lately I have been struggling a lot with overthinking. On my relationship especially but, mostly in general. I wake up filled with anxiety and my heart racing, and its gotten to a point I feel physically sick. Ive tried yoga, working out, etc but it doesnt help for long. Does anyone have tips? Genuinely good ones that work? Thank you.",
    "Fantasy brings me much more pleasure than reality, so how can I enjoy life again? Ive been struggling with depression for 10 years, and Im at a point where Im ready to just throw my hands up, and give up trying to find joy in the real world anymore. Ive always turned to some form of escapism as a coping strategy, whether its gaming, cartoons, or even just watching random YT videos. Now, I feel like I would just be happier if I could live in that escapism all the time. If there was a way I could just spend my life sleeping and dreaming all the time, I would. Even my therapist has acknowledged that life wont be as much fun as living in a gaming world or watching cartoons, so whats the point? So far, the main answer seems to be you just have to do it. I dont wanna die, but I dont wanna live either. Im convinced nothing would make me happier than if I were to live in my own head.",
    "Brushing your teeth when really depressed? I had a bit of a dental scare recently and was able to end up brushing and flossing twice a day for a month until I was able to get to the dentist I think this brushing was caused almost entirely by anxiety. I went to the dentist, and they said no cavities, but when they did gum measurements there were some pockets of 4 and some bleeding, which we dont like to see. They didnt exactly clarify what this meant, so I was like ah ok im fine and went back to my normal routine of basically never brushing my teeth because I can barely even get out of bed to pee. I ended up looking up what the pocket of 4 with bleeding meant a week later and it said gum disease and bone loss, so obviously now Im spiraling about all of my teeth falling out and having to get either numerous implants or dentures in my 20s... The point is, I do need to not only maintain my oral hygeine, but at the moment I need to actively improve it before I get too far. Anxiety will push me along for now, but I know that soon I will start to feel like my gums have recovered enough even if they havent, or just forget why Im anxious, and Ill stop brushing. Do you have recommendations for how to actually get myself into a habit to brush and floss my teeth not just chew some xylitol gum or keep mouthwash by your bed and spit it into a water bottle? Thanks",
    "How do I forgive myself? I find a girl who abused me but I took it because I felt thats what I deserved.. she cheated on me and left me, I was having a breakdown and the girl from Ohio would occasionally check on me. She saw that we broke up and she messaged me. Her relationship with her last boyfriend wasnt really working out and they broke up so we decided to talk again as friends and help each other out.. she eventually went to a mental hospital because she wanted to kill herself but I called her everyday she was there.. we had amazing conversations and I could tell she was starting to feel okay now that she was taking medication and getting some therapy.. when she got out I bought her a plane ticket and she came to see me, spent a month here and everything was going amazing and we started dating again.. when she went home I really missed her, wed talk on the phone and text and stuff but I really missed her. I was supposed to fly out in November so I can be there for her birthday but I begged shed come back in October cause I missed her so much, because of that she missed her appointments and couldnt get her medication and stuff and shes been here for a bit now. But she doesnt want to be with me.. the month before everything seemed okay. It was like we were in love again and she said that she thought she was but now that shes off her medication shes falling back into her old toxic behaviors she started developing after the things I did to her.. we argued a lot the first week she was here and I wish I wouldve just kept my mouth shut and I wish that I wouldve just went in November because wed probably still be together right now.. she leaves October 24th and it kills me seeing her here knowing that I had her again.. knowing I was a lot better.. but she doesnt want me anymore.. she says she doesnt want anyone for awhile until she can love herself.. and theres basically no chance Ill have her back.. how do I forgive myself? How do I stop hating myself? How do I love myself? How do I let her go? How do I stop these suicidal thoughts? Id really appreciate some advice.. I know I dont deserve sympathy.. thats not what I want..",

    "I ( 26 female ) have decided to take care of my severely depressed younger brother (20m ) by letting him move in with me last week and need some tips. Hey all ! I am new to the group and a Canadian I would like some advice. This is a VERY long post so bare with me. I took on basically taking care of my severely depressed younger brother. I am 26 and my brother is 20. I have been moved out for 4 years, my brother has been under child protective services from the overly toxic environment at home. For some background mom is an addict  alcoholic  and dad definitely has mental illness and severe emotional disregulation and is severely controlling and overall unhealthy and manipulative  violent outbursts , tantrums, controlling .they are both functional for the most part but very terrible to be around and our entire family became severely dysfunctional as a result and has suffered a lot. In the past I have had reactive depression but am better now here is what I experienced  Basically I can get depressed when sad events happen like breakup death or I would experience severe anxiety when I lived with my parents  to say the least  . I got depressed and severely melancholic  experience debiliating guilt ans selfhatred  and could not function well for months years after certain events happened so I relate to my brother and understand him very well. However, the difference between my brother and I is that I sought help and still speak to someone every 2 weeks.. My brother was always forced into help by CPS for example. He also is a highschool dropout 2x because of the home environment and I know that the social stigma that comes with this has really weighed down on his selfesteem. He is very smart  beat a Canadian chess champion at chess  but he never takes compliments and feels like his depression has altered his ability to retain information  poor memory, brain fog  . He is VERY hard on himself and I almost feel like he would rather stay depressed as a way to selfpunish himself for dropping out of highschool  he even told me he feels like he does not deserve anything good because he is in his own words a  loser .. and feels like he is tired of being alive. Not exactly suicidal in that he does not intent to kill himself but he is fed up of living so could very well do something dangerous if this continues .",

What do I do is there some way I can get out of this hell?",
    "Need advice o how to help my SO who is suffering with depression. Sorry if it's not the right place to put this. My SO is suffering with depression and anxiety and is refusing to get help. Its almost like he just doesnt want to. In fact he has said on multiple occasions that he doesnt want to get better. It all started when we had a termination for many different health reasons on my part. That was a good 6 months ago now. I went straight back to work afterward and he just didnt. All he is doing is burying his head in video games, he doesnt leave the house, doesnt help around the house or anything. We have been trying to get him to see someone and he just flat out refuses. He self medicates as well and I dont think that is helping at all, in fact I think it maybe contributing to the problem. But anytime anyone brings it up he just says that it isnt a problem. He did start to take some antidepressants but has decided that he isnt going to take them anymore. I know we cant force him to get help but he needs to do something. I have been trying to support him by giving him space and letting him do his own thing, but that just doesnt seem to be working. I just dont know what to do anymore. I am scared to bring any of this up to him as he just gets very defensive and nasty towards me just to clarify its not physical its just hurtful. Need some advice on what I can do to help.",
    "What would you do in my position? Im a pretty young boy still trying to develop my character. Im in high school. I like to think Im more mature than other people my age. Before I go into why Im so unsure about something, Im just going to give you some background story if you care to read it. Background In elementary school I was verbally abused by racism and many other factors. I was always picked on for some unknown reason. I like to think I was a very optimistic kid. However, those years was a turning point into how I ended up. I took this bullying pretty hard. I lived in fear the following year. I didnt tell anyone about how I felt. I remember crying almost daily. 2 years after the bullying crisis I started to feel like I healed. I thought I made true friends that year which end up being really bad. I was ignored by that person for who knows what. I started to hang out with girls more as friends. I felt they were more understanding. I think it affected how I act because I remember changing my personality 3 times. People started to tell me that I act like a girl. Even my own parents. So I changed myself again. I became more and more less optimistic. I became more dry and alone. That following year, those friends I made who were the girls was a mess. I was a mess. I was so much in pain I did so many stupid things. I dont even want to talk about those moments. I felt targeted by that friend and victimized. I was in fear that year too. At that moment I accepted that it was better for me to not have friends or anyone to care for me. I made this conclusion because my parents werent all that understanding either. I tried telling them how I feel multiple times, but they give me the answer that hurts even more. There are people having it worse than you which I agree. But I dont think thats the main issue. I think the part they should see is how their issue effects that person. Youre crying over a girlIm relating to that one year I was victimized.",
    "Please help Hi sorry this might be kind of confusing as I honestly just had a panic attack but Im staying with a best friend at her lake house and Ive been feeling really bad since shes been pretty much ignoring me. Even if she doesnt realize it. Shes also been openly Fighting With her step dad whose with us and its making me feel really sad and super uncomfortable. Its not like I can just leave and if I could I would. Ive also tried telling her how Im feeling through text but it didnt really work out and she thought we were over if after an hour but its more than what she thinks and its super hard for me to say anything since my anxiety is so bad at the moment. Ive cried 3 times today and just feel like complete shit. And I feel like I dont exist and at this point I really dont want to. I get that she has issues to deal with but I am her guest and idk I didnt think Id have to worry about this. Shes also been texting ppl and usually I dont mind but It started to make me uncomfortable yesterday when she would start sexting with random guys who she knew shes just block later. Like I really dont wanna hear about that I wanna have fun. Also once she found out I was upset like 10 mins ago she didnt even wanna help she just got mad when I couldnt say anything and stared having a panic attack. Then she stormed off saying she was gonna kill herself which really triggered me. Sorry I am on mobile if this comes out bad",
    "If antidepressants work, how does that change the way i support my partner? This girl im seeing is super sweet and i like her so much, but im still getting to know her. She recently told me that shes diagnosed with depression and does take prescribed doses of abt 30mg of anitdepressants. i have never really dealt with depression or people with depression in my life but i really want to support her however long it takes. however, she said that antidepressants DO work for her and makes her happier and all that stuff. so i was wondering, if it does work, is it better if i stay out of it? or are there still ways i can support her? besides the basics like patience and listening. thank you! !",

    "\"I'M WORSE THAN AN AUTOMATED BOT\" My online friend severely suicidal, and Im completely useless to help her. My attempt to use advice from the depressionsuicide talking tips sounds like a hotline script. Any advice is insulting, I know finding a hobby is not going to make her magically want to live. Telling her that I will miss her is just a selfish guilt trip. I find that just listening and asking basic questions doesnt help because I know a depressing response will follow, and it comes off as colduncaring. I have trouble countering the negative thoughts as she will often say, nobody cares about me and thats hard to hear as I care about her, but I do not want to invalidate her thoughts. I once told her that I thought she was amazing, and she just responded that she knows herself better than I do and that she will never feel that way. ___________ What do you want to hear from a friend? I am in an endless loop of telling her that I am here, and that I care.",
    "I need help Im going to open up and be honest just because Im at a breaking point. This is a breakup story that has been like non before. I M27 was dating a beautiful girl F24 on and off for three years. We met in college where we dated for a year before we separated the first time. In that first year she had to have surgery to remove a bone spur on her foot and put on some weight. Personally that doesnt bother me. Ive never cared for my ladies weight, Im more into the personality, but it mattered to her as I saw her put herself in a bout of depression, harsh judgements to herself, and ultimately was just very unhappy all the time. I did all I could, telling her not to worry about it, cooking healthier meals, telling her shes just not as active. And eventually after 6 months of recovery we started to go back to the gym but she was never the same so. And after having to remind her everyday, every conversation that everything would be ok to no aval, I broke up with her. I regret this decision. I made this decision because I too, to some degree am self conscious and at the time I took it as a response to me. I thought she was unhappy with me. We ended up trying again a short 4 months later but it too was short lived. Same result, every conversation wed have, shed talk about her weight, and I could see in her face how unhappy she was. This was also a bad time in her family as her mother just got breast cancer. So she went back home. On the way home AL gt KY her car broke down and without hesitation I drove the 4 hours to meet up with her to fix her car and drove back because I still loved her. During this time covid began and any shot of seeing her was gone. I just started a 6 month coding boot camp where my days were pretty much planned from 8am8pm Monday  Saturday. We had talked about how I could be a developer, working from anywhere and I could be with her and she was a marine biologist, so her work was dependant on location so I was okay with going wherever she needed to be. While in the bootcamp, we rarely talked, living our separate lives.",
    "r/Suicidewatch didn't really give me what I needed, so I'm sharing my feelings on this subreddit My depression has gotten so worse, and I just want to end it all. I cant imagine a future for myself anymore. I had everything going for me before I had depression, but now, I have nothing. I have no friends, and even when I did have friends, all of my conversations were one sided with all of them, and I felt so alone when I was friends with them. My dad is my only parent. My dad isnt there for me when Im at my worst, and hes only there for me when I have a high GPA or get all As. I had to convince him for three years that I had an issue when I had a possible anxiety disorder. Recently, I havent had the best grades due to my worsening depression, and when my dad confronted me about it, I told him that I didnt have the energy to do the work, because I may have depression, and he took my phone away because I didnt tell him the whole story essentially invalidating my feelings. Ive told him two months ago that I thought about suicide, and he ignored me. On my birthday, I attempted suicide, but stopped at the third pill, and tried to tell my dad, and he said Im doing this all because he took my phone away along with other stuff and yelled at me, essentially he implied that I was doing it for attention. He doesnt care about me when Im at my worst. My dad always says, Youve changed since middle school, and in middle school you werent like this whenever I tell him. Nobody really cares about you until youre gone. Hell never understand. Even the fucking school staff has made my life worse by scolding me for my F in the class in front of all the students, and everyone nearby which was a lot of people heard since most of them glanced at me. Even a month later, a girl who was really far away from where me and the counselor were heard and asked about it, and whether I was staying in that class. My English teacher had noticed that Im no longer turning in assignments and scolded me in front of the class by saying, Whats wrong with you?!",
    "I have absolutely no motivation and no will to live..... Im 20, recently Ive noticed that I want to do nothing, except, maybe, die... the thing is, I have also dermatillomatia since I was 14, I tried taking some antidepressants, which my psychiatrist has prescribed me, but, unfortunately, they didnt suit me. So, my life is getting more shitty each day. Yesterday I turned 20. I was with my parents, because I have only one friend, who is my roommate and now I have no will to expand the circle of friends... I was crying all the time and my parents were crying too...such a horrible birthday... I didnt mean to hurt my parents. So, now my mom is planing to be by my side Ive moved to another city, which is 1500km away from my hometown, to start university till I pass my exams, and then Ill be examined to find out which pills for sure will help me. But, still, I need any tips from you guys which maybe would help me to survive this months......",
    "35M in dire need of support/advice Hi everyone. It is my last resort posting on here but I just dont know what else to do? Ive been struggling to keep things together the last few days. Today I just broke down as I couldnt keep things together no more. First of all Im a mature normal person other then my mental health problems. I am on meds and see my doctor regularly. Just today I had a breakdown. Id rather not contact emergency or go to the hospital as Ive been there before an they hold me from going outside. I have payments to make and cannot afford to be held in hospital as this will screw things up even more. I live in a small town out in the country. Tonight I decided to go out for a walk, I end up in the ditch just watching the stars is where I am now. I am feeling empty, I cant help it but fall into tears, I just dont know what to do. Im also feeling alittls suicidal but not the biggest risk just yet. Just looking for advice or someone I could chat with? Feel free to pm me. Thanks.",
    "It's okay for me to be depressed, right? Here is why. I am really depressed. But its okay, right? Its probably healthy that I am very depressed, because if I wasnt I would be in real bad shape, right? 1. My wife doesnt respect me. 2. My kid doesnt respect me. 3. My wife was having an emotional affair with her boss and kept on lying to me about it and still works there. Nothing seems to be going on now, but who knows. The episodes were years ago, but when I look at everything together I jus think wow... 4. I have been in basically a sexless marriage for 19 years. 5. I have cheated by getting happy endings and watching porn. I feel horrible about this. 6. I am unemployed. I cant keep a job. No one will hire me. I am an older worker and dont know what to do. 7. I want to get out of the marriage but dont know how. I cant support myself. ITS OKAY TO BE DEPRESSED RIGHT? I CANT THINK STRAIGHT..... I LITERALLY cant think straight. I cant focus on getting things done.",
    "It’s painful to keep going Its been awhile since I confessed to my parents about my emotions and problems. Ever since then, theyve been easier on me and did their best to make me happy. But its only gotten worse, I feel guilty that I added stress on my parents when they already had enough to deal when raising me. I got better at first but it keeps going downhill, Im not improving at all. My dreams and motivation to live is slowly fading away, but I dont want to hurt anyone anymore. I dont want to sit through this, I want it to end so badly. Ive met a therapist and it didnt help much. Im not entirely sure if medication even helped me. My friends are here for me but I hate to bother them so much, I feel guilty for taking up their time. I want to end it here, it feels like its never gonna improve.",
    "feeling kind of depressed (cycle) for a while 18 year old here. One day I kind of realized there was an ugly aspect of my face deep set eyes with some hyperpigmentation. I learnt thats a thing seen mostly in people of color amp has to do with facial structure or something like that. I think I had a panic attack because I was crying about it for a while and then became normal again. But the next day around the same time the same thing happened..then I was happy again Im of course one of many people who dont really call themselves pretty and never really considered it. But right now Im thinking maybe if I get therapy and stay there for as long as possible, Ill feel somewhat better or calm. I wont fall back into the cycle of feeling depressed about it, it was kind of traumatic. Dont really think its Body dysmorphia, or could it be? I dont really care about looks too much. But I hate seeing my face most of the time. Ive even been listening tousing affirmations amp frequencies on YouTube recently to change that ugly aspect so I can just look pretty ok. In other words it just sucks. I guess for some people many people obviously genes didnt work out so well. Wish I looked better. Then I would be carefree and not worry about this. Dont even know what I really am actually. Should people like me just give up..maybe not because I do have other interests which at least are entertaining. I like drawing, making edits amp watching videos, etc. I think Im falling into that depressive cycle again and I just want it to end. But I dont know how. Is there anyone else with a similar situation? Or just someone here with a solution or anything at all. Or just talk about life",
    "Cheated on my girlfriend by dating a girl I met online playing games This all happened while I was still dating my girlfriend while she was away for an internship. So I met a nice girl online playing a game almost like 2 months ago and the vibes between us are good. I confessed to her and wr started dating online. The only problem is that she seems to suffer from depression and im trying to help her, sometimes staying really late or not sleeping just to keep her company, playing games with her, shes really beautiful. Shes from another country not far from here, and I want to meet her. My girlfriend came back recently and found out about that I was texting and dating another girl. I dumped my girlfriend inmediately after this. I feel really sorry for her. From time to time I still miss her, last week I had been trying to contact her to make it up but she ghosted me. I miss the intimacy with her. I tried with another number but shes not picking up my calls nor answering. What should I do?, any kind of advice would be appreciated.",
    "My friend is cutting herself My friend has been battling with depression ever since quarantine took place and had cut her leg twice now. Im not sure what to do and I feel lost on how to help her. Ive told her parents, friends, Ive even sent a wanting one Safe UT to our school. It seems no one except me is doing anything. Ive never dealt with anyone except myself with these things and dealt with them internally and by myself for years, which is why I am helping her outwardly because it sucked. Id love any advice from you guys. Thank you.",
    "Anything. I just need something to get me to the end of this 10+ hour shift. All week I have been depressed at some point. For a while I was able to take this meaningless life of never ending work, but after 2 months of my boss working as many 12 hour days as he could to pay for his weeding, I cant keep my depression aways anymore.

    "What are some things I can do to better understand and how to help the person I’m seeing with their depression/ptsd Ive been seeing this person for awhile now and I know they have depression and ptsd, and I understand it to a degree dealing with depression and anxiety myself but I want to understand more so when we talk about it I can say more than you had it rough or itll get better and things along those lines.

    "Just need to rant a little bit Ive always been someone who bottles up my thoughts, problems and feelings. I know that its a shitty way of dealing with things but oh well... Its come back to bite me in the arse now. Im a senior so uni is coming up later this year. Im having so much trouble planning my future, choosing what to study etc. I was thinking of having a gap year, but my country is changing some stuff which will make it much harder for me to get in 2020, so I should apply this year instead. My finals are coming up really soon and Im so terrified of not doing well. And I dont know if Im just imagining things but it feels like things are falling apart with my best friends too. It feels like theyre ganging up together against me, to pick on me and freeze me out. Everytime I hang out with them I feel extra depressed, but at the same time I feel guilty for being a downer. No ones asked me how Im doing, but I also dont want to dump my problems onto anyone. It feels like my friends wouldnt care anyway. So much has changed, theyve changed so much since the first year. I feel like I cant trust them anymore. My boyfriend cheated on me a few months ago so our relationship ended, and I feel really lonely. I just want to cry and isolate myself from the world. I hate myself for being like this. God, I feel so helpless and lonely.",
    "God I can't help it Ive tried getting help. Ive tried, I really have. Ive just been so empty, literally and figuratively. Since about 2015 I started getting hate for being ugly and fat and whatnot. Im currently starving myself to the point I start eating my skin. Then I eat like theres no tomorrow. I keep getting hate, and limited myself to being out in public. Im slowly dieing and I dont know what to do. Doctors dont really help, they just recommend a diet and give me prescription anti depressants. Ive stared an addiction to Heroine. It lets me be free and all my emptiness goes away. I cry myself to sleep with the thought that no one cares about me anymore and my only friend is Herione. Im just asking reddit what to do before I end it. Im slowly eating at my sanity to keep my ever powerful lust to just be like others. People of reddit, what should I do?",
    "I want to go home I F, 19 am a sophomore in college. I have a wonderful family my three siblings and I are extremely close, and our parents love us and each other. I know Im very lucky for that. I grew up on a small farm in the desert, and we were dirt poor. Our house was a hundred years old and was built from adobe and railroad ties. The plywood floors had holes in them that snakes and mice would come through, and my sister and I shared a bed until I was twelve. I remember times when all we had to eat was what we had left over from the previous harvest and the animals we had raised. My summers were spent working our land and taking trips with my friends from church and school to the muddy river that only flowed with the snowmelt in the spring and the torrential monsoons in the summer. We always had dogs and barn cats and chickens. It was so simple and easy, and I loved that farm and my life with my whole heart. When I was 15, we moved to a city a few hours away and kept the farm. Wed go up on weekends to take care of little projects, and I would get to see the friends Id grown up with. I never felt like I had really moved away. Ive since started college in a town much closer to my farm, and I go to visit often. My dad stayed up there for work and stays in a trailer we brought up. He takes care of our chickens and farms in the warmer months. Our work weekends are more scattered now that all the kids are grown and moved away. Our house is uninhabitable now and the land is going wild again. Coming home just isnt the same anymore. Lately, all I want, and all I can think about, is to go home. Not just making the drive and seeing my dad and the farm. I fantasize about waking up in the morning in my bed, 10 again, snuggled with my sister against the cold and the wind howling outside. I want to be with my family the way we were when we all lived under the same roof and to work in the garden and take walks through the desert with my brother, looking for elk and coyote tracks in the river basin.",
    "I want to learn to appreciate the positive gay inclusion and acceptance, and stop letting homophobia and gay exclusion and alienation burden me I am a feminine gay guy. So, not only am I guy, but I like being feminine too in my appearance and behavior. And especially online, I keep on and on and on coming across SO many people against homosexuality, andor people against men being allowed to be feminine. ampx200B And what I have been using since I was a kid to try to help make me feel better is feelgood escapism in the forms of movies and shows. But as an adult, I cant even use that, since the type of movies and shows Im interested in keeps excluding homosexuals and feminine guys. And even when they dont, the representation is poorly handled. ampx200B I love fantasy, I love science fiction, I love superhero stuff, I love animated stuff. Literally only example of a feminine male character Ive seen depicted in a good proper way is in the Youtubeexclusive animated show Hazbin Hotel. And, when it comes to a homosexual male romance where you get to see the two males fall in love, share their first kiss, become a couple, and stay a couple without either one of them dying at any point? To my knowledge, it doesnt exist within these genres. ampx200B But I try very hard to stay positive, and appreciate what I DO have as opposed to what I dont. I got that Hazbin Hotel character Angel Dust. And I got an openly gay male character in the ParaNorman movie, and in Avengers Endgame. So, good step in the right direction I suppose. ampx200B And furthermore, people ARE getting more gaysupportive, and more people are encouraging gay inclusion. So rationally, I should know better. But I keep feeling so sad and depressed and tired of life, feeling like there is no escapism properly working for me whenever I feel down. And I just dont know how to deal with it.",
    "Feeling Super Stuck - Would Love Some Advice Hey guys. Im posting this in the depression forum because Im hoping for some advice from people who know what its like to live with depression. Im stuck in a bad situation with no good options, and I think it would be difficult for anyone without including severe depression and anxiety, but Ive got that too. Also, I just think I need some compassion and understanding right now, and so this feels like the right place to post this. TLDR Im a Canadian living in Houston. My wife is finishing up her surgical fellowship, and because of Covid, getting my US work authorization is taking forever. The combination of unemployment and being in a toxic relationship has left me miserable and fighting with depression and anxiety. If we didnt have a two and half year old daughter I would have split with my wife a while ago. Without employment I cant afford to get my own place here, and staying in this relationship is killing my soul. Im feeling insanely stuck  any advice? Long version Im living in Houston with my wife and two and half yearold daughter. My wife is a surgical fellow, and is currently deciding on which of the three job offers she has to become a full staff doctor in one of three US cities. I sold my business back in Canada earlier this year, and because of Covid and probably the existing general slowness of the US government, getting my US work authorization is taking forever. Im likely going to have to wait another three or four months until Im able to work, and at that point Ill still have to find a job. Unfortunately, as soon as my wifes current job is over in June, Ill have to stop working immediately, and will have to reapply for US work authorization again when she gets her new visa issued. So optimistically Ill be able to work for four out of the next 12 months and while Im a highly qualified person, I may not be able to find a wellpaying job right away. Working remotely for a Canadian company is possible, but those jobs pay poorly and theyre surprisingly hard to come by. I grew up in an abusive home, and was abused basically daily from about the age of four until I left at 16.",
    "How do I get to the point of WANTING to get better? TLDR  Depressed for probably 10 years. Heavy sucidal thoughts for about 5. Is there any chance of getting better if I dont even want to, or seeing the point of it? Alright, gonna keep this as short as possible, since Im tired of giving my life story and also I hate myself for whining about this and not pulling myself up. On the surface and in reality, my life is great. I got a job, I got a girl, I got an apartment. I got a dog. Im healthy. I believe Im quite intelligent although it feels like depression has made me very much more stupider and I forget things all the time. I got it all. I can act all extroverted and social if the situation demands it. I come from a broken home with divorces, drugalcoholverbal and physical abuse. But I still consider my childhood to have been good. I had friends, I had fun. I just dont want to live. I see no point in me continuing doing so other than to not mess up the lives of my friends and family or mostly my gf and my grandma, dont care too much about the others. I have a very detailed and thought out plan of how I would end my life, with small chances of failure. I know its not the right thing to do, but it would just feel sooo good not to feel like a useless piece of shit who cares about no one. Who sees no future or no reason in moving on. Who gets hung up on all his failures and shortcomings. Tried several different antidepressants in increasing doses over the course of 3 years. Only gave me side effects o I quit out of spite. Seen numerous doctors, psychiatrists and therapists. Only felt mocked and not taken seriously so I quit out of spite. Been admitted to the psychiatric ward sry, google translate, a good place to get depressed by the way, but I talked my way out of there after a week. Ive tried quitting my job. Quitting my band. Quitting my girlfriend. Exercising. Eating heathier.",
    "Staying POSITIVE is ALREADY hard and now I am the caregiver to a SUICIDAL FRIEND I was pretty much unsure what to do so I wrote a letter to the family secretly I know where she stays and i made sure to text her mum that I had put a letter outside their house gate. They eventually texted back to express their gratitude but I did not hear from them afterwards... So again, she had her bouts of episode and meltdowns and I had to calm her down every single time. it gets exhausting for me as well. And I always feel that I am trying to fight against absorbing and feeling down from all of these. Recently, she went for a staycay and her mum called me. She was begging me to ask my friend to cancel it to which i have no influence on at all since my friend was really optimistic about this she initially had plans to kill herself during this trip but after meeting another psychologist, she kind of is delayin it. When her mum called me a second time, i was with my friend and my friend was really on the edge. She tried taking my phone away from me to talk to her mother but I stopped her. Her mum SAID thru the phone since i didnt know she is with you and you are still going to allow her to go for the staycay, ALL is on you. YOU SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY IF SMTG HAPPENS TO HER. I DONT CARE but you make sure she is safe. I was quite upset by this but politely ended the call as my friend tried grabbing the phone away from me. Ended up, she called her mum back only to shout and scream at her mum  berating the mum for calling me. Her mum was upset. The mum texted me and blamed me for my friends action. I replied to her saying I was sorry that that happened and that I tried calming my friend but she went hysteria instead. The mum later replied telling me that since my friend does not listen to her as a mother, i should be the one doing the advice and guiding my friend to the so called right path. She said that she leave me to take care of my friend for her. Im speechless guys.. I am so exhausted already but yet this happened??",

My husband has put me through hell with leaving constantly, infidelity, and being emotionally unavailable. The more he pulls away the more I throw myself into a deeper feeling of helplessness and cry out for help. I have always been quick to move on or to cope but Im starting to lose all motivation and hope.

    "I dont love/like my mother and idk if the relationship is worth salvaging. Im 28m shes 49fTheres a lot of backstory here so ill try to sum up some main points for context. My mother has substance abuse issues all through my life. It caused me to live with my grandparents multiple timea in my life from 36 then again from 1116 til my grandmother died and i had nowhere else to go. I ended up living with her due to some medical issues for myself at the time i had to drop out of school.and get my GED and a job. She made me pay rent 250 a month full time 40 hours a week back then i was making roughly 280 dollars a week. Whatever pay rent no problem even though Id be more supportive of my kid going through a terrible time but whatever. I also had to pay for my own food and such. The problem was a lot. My room was storage for her and her boyfriend i literally had just a bed and the rest were boxes of junk the boyfriend who was a hoarder didnt want to throw out. On top of that he was a terrible person who would constantly bad mouth my mother, steal my weed and other things from my roomi actually caught him on camera and showed him and he still denied it to my face. One day he did it in front of me and i beat the shit outta him and i ended up leaving and sleeping on friends couches etc. Now at the time I wouldve fucking killed for my mother. So her picking him over me kinda broke my heart back then but it is what it is. Fast forward a couple years20 i ended up living back with her doing the same stuff but this time at least i had a room that didnt have junk in it. But the abusive boyfriend was still there and it was the same pay rent and. all of my food. She starts letting her friends from the methadone clinic she goes too stay in the house...for FREE. Another thing she been on methadone for like 13 years, thats not how methadone should work but fuck it im no doctor.",
    "r/Suicidewatch didn't really give me what I needed, so I'm sharing my feelings on this subreddit My English teacher had noticed that Im no longer turning in assignments and scolded me in front of the class by saying, Whats wrong with you?! Youve changed Ive lost all hope in life. Ive dropped my AP classes for Honors ones, even though I had mainly As in them. I havent even studied for the one AP class I do have, and I only have it since Im in an academic program that I cant get out of. The friends that I do have barely talk or text me, and I have to text them if I want to talk to them. My friends give dead replies like yeah or are just shy or something, but I can never have a convo with them. The friends that I used to have made me feel so alone. My dad invalidated my feelings. Ive been drowning and screaming for help, yet no one has helped. I caught on to my depression so early that it actually had a chance of being cured if I had gotten immediate help. I did not, and now I feel like dying will make the world a better place for everyone around me. Ill no longer have to make eye contact with old friends, or be a burden to my dad. Ill no longer have to worry about feeling lonely or having one sided conversations anymore. Ill be happier. I dont want to live for anyone, since that is selfish to the person who asks me to live for them, their happiness. I cant picture a future life for me anymore. I tried telling my old friend about my depression, and she said stuff along the lines of I can relate though I dont have depression. Im aware that shes trying to connect with me since she doesnt know what to say, but it makes me feel invalidated, like my feelings are just your normal sadness. Ive called the suicide hotline four times, but all they do is repeat what I say and add makes you feel upset, doesnt it?

    "Years of worsening chronic fatigue/fog continue to cripple my life Hey everybody, My life itself has always been pretty good, but my quality of life has been awful for the last 8ish years. I am currently 23, and this is a quick timeline of whats been going on  Age 1314, started experiencing general anxiety for no apparent reason. Also, felt stressed a lot for no real reason either. Doctor thought it might be anxietydepression so suggested I see a therapist and try some antidepressants. I tried a couple antidepressants and saw a therapist with no success. Antidepressants did absolutely nothing, and therapist was at a loss as to how to help. This generalized anxietyworrystress feeling continued. Age 16, while still dealing with the above, I woke up one day after a good nights sleep and felt a little tired. I attributed it to anxiety or stress from school, but it NEVER went away. But it was very mild, so I just let it go and tried making lifestyle changes with no success. Over the months and years, it has very gradually worsened to the point where Im at now where I can hardly function due to the overwhelming fatiguebrain fog. It is 247. Not even a second of feeling better. Age 17present Have had nearly every sort of medical testing one can have done, many of them multiple times. Food allergy, vitaminmineral deficiencies, thyroid, cortisol, testosterone, heavy metals, MRI, EEG, EKG, Lyme disease, Epstein Barr, h pylori, sleep apnea, dietary changes, sleep schedule changes, increase exercise, etc. Have tried a total of 7 different antidepressantsanxieties from different drug classes to see if maybe depression was the culprit. All either did nothing or made me more tiredfoggy. Ive tried Vyvanse, Adderall, Ritalin, kratom, CBD, kava, and countless other supplements. The stimulants all either helped very slightly, but felt very artificial and made my body more anxious but didnt help my mind, or didnt do anything. Caffeine in any form doesnt help either.",
    "Sometimes the worst part isn't what happened to us but being alone with the pain from what happened to us I spent some money on something helpful for my mom that she very much uses and loves because Im grateful for her help which was what she was talking about and after getting angry at her but expressing it in an unhealthy way I feel like shit. It doesnt feel the same trying to vent online, because I want my female friends that I know and care about and feel a genuine connection with to make me feel heard and listened to, and always starting from zero talking to strangers and trying to provide context about who I am and the dexterity of my mental illness is exhausting. Im a very supportive and helpful person to my said friends when it comes to mental health problems, and having to be on the receiving end and in need of help at inconvenient times just sucks. In the past Ive posted to reddit and people will look at my post history saying you are a very mentally ill person and should get help. And I wish I could just say that most of us mentally ill people dont have to luxury to afford anything that actually can help. And well have to take what little opportunities we can get even if its not ideal or in the least helpful. Lonely people dont have the luxury to choose who can comfort them. I still feel the lump in my throat and ache in my chest from a crisis and breakdown but at least Ive expressed myself",
    "I'm so tired This years been shit, I just cant deal with it anymore. Ive tried so hard to be strong and do everything i could to feel better but its just gotten too much. Last year during summer I felt awful, no other way to describe it. Originally I thought it was from the quarantining, not seeing my friends, having to see the really state of the world that time was a very cold realization to a lot of problems in my country that just left me confused, sad and annoyed, but the more I looked for answers the more confusing it got. I just wouldnt feel better, Id sleep all day, not have the motivation to do anything I used to like, it was awful. Seeing friends and being around them apparently covered up a lot of what Ive been feeling. I spoke to a therapist towards the end of summer and it was pretty obvious I had an actual form of depression. In retrospect its probably been there for a while. A few years ago I remember random bouts of feeling miserable despite everything in my life seemingly going well, along with it hitting like a truck when things went poorly. Last year I remember not really doing anything I enjoyed, even basic things like turning on a game felt monumental, let along sitting down and drawing something, so for months on end I just didnt. Talking to a friend also made me realize just how far back it went, I dont really remember it at all but he told me about a time in seventh grade where I told him I was depressed. So here I am almost a year after its been diagnosed, a complete mess. Back to the end of summer, throughout the entire thing i fought with my family a lot, they didnt exactly care for the whole deadly virus thing and kept taking us out to see people. It was really confusing for me, it seemed so simple just wear a mask and stay home for a while to keep other people safe, but here I was arguing with my parents about how we shouldnt be going out. Thats when the topic of school opening came up, there was a virtual and hybrid option, I wanted to stay home and they were dead set on getting me back in.",
    "Is my \"popular\" intensive trauma program abusive/unfit/re-traumatizing for me? I feel like my intensive trauma program is deeply harming me. I wanna talk about it with people outside my treatment team. So, Ive outlined my history and concerns as concisely and as comprehensively I could.. any input is appreciated lt3 You can skip sections if you like. ampx200B Background  Im a young adult female. Ive struggled with CPTSD for many years now as a result of childhood trauma and adult experiences of abuseviolence. I slipped into a severe depressive episode this year after a sexual assault. I have a caring primary care doctor and a psychiatrist  they want to help me manage the intense levels of panic and depression Ive recently experienced while using minimal medication. Ive been on mirtazipine an antidepressant for 4 weeks and Im able to function more reduced depression but ongoing anxiety. I am also trying to eat more and gain weight as I am underweight. Issues Nightmares resulting insomnia, panic attacks that last 26 hours, flashbacks, hyper vigilance, dissociation, physical pain, anxiety, depression. I also experience a lot of self doubt and self blame. No history of hallucinations, drug misuse, or violence towards others. All of the above have improved significantly while being on mirtazipine. I am now able to sleep regularly and eat well when before I was neither able to sleep nor eat due to the level of panic symptoms I was experiencing. Mere improvements in sleep have allowed me to better manage anxiety and panic when they do happen. My goals  I want help with regulating sleep, food, and mood so I am more equipped to manage triggers and painful memories, while also creating a future worth moving towards. My bodys responses are natural responses to an unnatural situation of abuse. I want to be able to listen to my body and give myself what I need, which is tenderness, kindness, and respect. I expect respect and gentleness from people I interact with as well  it is essential for my healing.

Ive given late handins for a lot of my projects, not done other projects properly, and not handed in some other projects all together. Whenever I get stressed I dont do anything and I still havent made any friends at uni. To be fair, I do have high school friends, but none of them are interested in the field I want to go into. I feel so alone a lot of the times, I feel useless and I feel dumb. I did go for therapy in the past, it was just for a couple of months after I told my mom I was cutting myself. That ended when my therapist said I didnt need any help. Im sorry, Im babbling. The point of why Im writing this is because I cant seem to ask the people in my life for help. Hell, right now Im swinging back and forth between asking a bunch of internet strangers. But I feel like Im going crazy. Every time I make up my mind to go tell my mom or my sister or my brother about these things, I convince myself out of it. i tell myself that these problems arent that big of a deal, that Id only be disturbing them my sister recently had a baby, so shes spending a lot of her time taking care of him that these problems arent problems and that I just need to get off my stupid lazy ass and do my work. And then i dont ask for help. And now Im starting to think that this post is a dumb idea. This wont actually achieve anything. Im complaining to strangers about problems that arent problems. Im just being stupid. Im sorry.",

    "I feel like garbage, and I don't know what to do. This probably isnt that big of a problem, sorry for wasting your time if you read this. Hi, Im Viktor. Im 17, I live in the US, and I just feel kinda lost. I have a best friend thats my age. She lives overseas though. So our only method of communication is online messaging or calls. Recently, Ive been feeling really just kinda empty and bad. Ive been on break and its almost over and through it all, Ive struggled to feel happy. I have to fake all my smiles so that my family dont start worrying about me. Due to this feeling of emptiness, I would talk with my friend a lot about it. But I thought that I was being annoying, so I told her I wouldnt talk with her again until I feel better. Its been about 3 days. Which is a bit because we just about talk every day. Today Ive just been crying and havent been able to stop until a little over 30 minutes ago. It sucks, and it hurts, and I dont know what Im doing. I missed the deadline to apply to the college I wanted the final deadline, and I dont think theyll take my application late. I feel so tiny and helpless and awful, and I just needed to tell someone. Anyone. Sometimes I think people would just be better off without me around.",
    "I got cheated on by my now ex-boyfriend of six years and I feel worthless We ended up getting to the venue early enough where the line was already forming. We decided to stay and just wait it out. During this time I noticed he was texting someone a lot. I read the name and realized it wasnt someone I was familiar with. I clicked on me what might be happening, with being on the verge of a panic attack I asked him if he was talking to someone else and he could just as nswr honestly. He told me no, that it was just a girl that was a friend. I wasnt buying it. We went through the concert. Went to the local bars had two drinks and headed back to the Airbnb. I didnt want to be the fool so I did what needed to be done where I could get answers. I looked through his phone. Sure enough, he was talking to someone else. I didnt know how to handle the situation but I knew I needed to make aware the other party of my presence. I told them who I was, how long Ive known him, and the status we were in. I then added them on Snapchat and sent them pictures of us through the years to proof that I wasnt lying and that I wasnt just anyone. As soon as he woke up he saw his phone and knee something was up because she sent him a message. That if he had a girlfriend that he should have told her that way she would have kept it more friendly. I ended up messaging her for quite a while and basically becoming more aware of the situation as he had lied to her as well that he hadnt been dating me since August. He wouldnt speak to me and he wouldnt care to admit that he was a liar and cheater. He decided he would be taking an Uber to the bus station because he couldnt stand being with me. It didnt work out as plan and he ended up leaving back home with me. Once we got closer I confronted him. I couldnt keep in what I was thinking and wanted to let him know what I felt. It sucked. He said he hadnt loved me for a while.",
    "Can someone please help me to understand what’s going on with me? Please I’m getting desperate. Its been about a week in half now and Ive been experiencing either a neutral mood or a sad mood. Today is a sad mood unfortunately but yesterday was a happy mood for once. On the sad mood days I feel sluggish, unmotivated, hopeless, suicidal thoughts here and there. This sucks. I honestly dont know what to do. Are my antidepressants malfunctioning me? Ive been on them for only 3 months. I dont wanna see how long these neutral to sad episodes last because my birthday is coming up in about 3 weeks...and Im not trying to be sad. I keep saying to myself itll go away when Im feeling better but then I just go back to being sad the next day or 2. Ive been told that this could be BPD. But I dont think so because I dont experience mania, just depression and then my neutral mood or sometimes happiness. Someone please Im desperate, literally have been asking for some help to just understand this. I think Im broken",
    "I am so confused Ill be straight forward, Im not diagnosed yet. I havent really been checked so I may still very well suffer from the condition, but I apologize if I dont qualify to post here. So my problem begins maybe three years back. Out of nowhere Im randomly sad about myself for no reason in particular. I brushed it off as regular old sadness and have no other thought. Then a couple months later I notice its happening more and more frequently. I thought it could genuinely have been depression, but I was convinced into brushing it off as teen angst. Over the next year it stayed the same, random bouts of sadness and lack of motivation for a day or two at the time. Fast forward to now and Ive started being sad nearly daily. I can sometimes go a week and rarely close to a month without experiencing severely as I have, but like I said thats it sometimes. I have suicidal thoughts so often theyve stopped bothering me. I quite often cry at night and have recently started drinking when this happens. I sometimes think I want to die but I know there are people who care. I have a loving family and great friends. I just cant get what I want out of life and I dont want to live a long unfulfilled life. Dont get me wrong, Id much rather be happy and live for as long as possible, but part of me wants to give up. Im not asking for professional diagnosis, but would you say this is regular sadness or am I verging on depression? Thanks, anon",
    "Help finding therapist Hi everyone. First time posting here and looking to see if anyone has any advice. This is not a throw away because I dont care what people think about me. I suffer from highly functional depression. I have been seeing a psychiatrist and am currently on medication, which helps, but still have bad days. I have seen a psychologist in the past, middle aged male, that I couldnt open up to. After seeing him for 2 years I stopped going because of work change. My spouse, primary care, and psychiatrist all urge me to find someone to talk to. I thought long and hard and realized the personality of someone that I could open up to. With all this being said, is there a good way to search for local therapists online in your area? I tried a few months back and could only find older individuals. I need someone closer to my age 36 as I feel it would allow me to open up more. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.",
    "i don’t think i even get as unmotivated as i do being just tired i work for like less than an hour and im going back to bed and laying there for so long. i cant focus because im so tired. i try and eat high protein, whole grains, i hydrate, i take short walks, i let sunlight in, i sleep 810 hours. but i get so tired. i just plain dont want to do anything. what do i do? i hate sitting all day at my computer working because i spread out my work so far. its so bad and im gaining a pound every week despite eating below or at maintenance most days. i feel my muscles getting weaker and weaker and getting fatter and fatter but i cant sit up and focus long enough simply because working exhausts me so much. i cant make time for exercise because an hour task for me is three hours. and i could focus if i werent just plain exhausted all the time. nothing helps not even making a schedule. how do i get my energy back?",
    "I don’t know why I’m seeking help here but please just read as much as you can... Theres heaps more I can talk about like my addiction to games even when Im not enjoying them and the recent passing of artist xxxtentacion I know hes a very controversial person but I really enjoyed his music and just seeing his face and hearing his messages to his fans. Im failing at school since year 8 and Im always feeling worried about how I went in a test or having 1000 bricks on my chest scared what my mum will say when she sees how I went. I spent the entire 2nd half improving and trying my best especially in English where my teacher would repeatedly remind me Im an intelligent kid but Im just lazy, and when I thought I had improved I went from the first semester being all Cs and turned it into Cs and one D. I cant focus on anything important in class, I cant remember stuff and it feels like everything Ive explained in this post is coming together and ruining my life, making me feel hopeless and giving me a feeling of life being pointless. My ideal life right now would be one where I can stay home all day without worrying about any responsibilities or having to deal with my peers or school. Being around people seems to make me feel more lonely. Being around family im almost always happy. Avoiding all of these things feels like it would make me feel great again even though me in my right mind wouldve hated the idea of being alone at home all day with my boring parents. I dont know what to do. I want to see a doctor deep down but i also dont want to know if theres something wrong, I dont want to do the whole medication and therapy thing. I just want to be a normal kid who can be happy and out there like I used to be. Im sorry for talking so much but I just wanted to let it all out and ask if people think these are signs that I should seek help. Maybe if theres anybody going through something similar to me who has been diagnosed. Any sign to help me know whats wrong with me because I want to seek help but I dont want to tell my parents about it and have them tell me Im just going through the teenage stage of life, and then have a doctor tell me the same and make me look and feel even worse.",
    "Essential worker, trying to fix my depression nest. My husband and I are essential workers, weve been working through the entire pandemic. Opposite shifts, gruelingly long hours and weeks, and extreme pandemic depression. I have been a neat freak since I got out on my own, and he was always a little messy, but could clean up after himself. I was to the point where I was considering ending my life. We hate our jobs, but we cant do anything that pays better right now, we make okay money. We both work 12 hours a day. Our house is in disarray. I lived with a hoarder for years, and it didnt ever feel this bad. Dirty dishes, halffull pizza boxes, trash, our bedroom floor is basically just water bottles at this point. We are both trying to turn it around. Its so overwhelming. If we could get it clean, we could keep up with it. Its just the two of us, and were half dead from work every single day. We get to see each other one day a week. I wish I could just hire someone to help us, but its too messy. I couldnt imagine hiring someone and letting them see how bad our home is. I feel like I cant rest or breathe in this. Where do I even start? What can we do?",

I do them and I dont feel anything  no surprise, no fascination, no hatred. My friends talk around me about their passions, their dreams and I feel I have no direction and also I feel everything is pointless. Even the field I study in College is not so fascinating or surprising, its just decent and I can learn that quantify of information.

    "I'm tired of my lack of motivation Hi, first post here, so Idk if the flair is right and if I will be able to put in words my feelings. Anyways, Ill give it a try, so sorry for the long post. Since the beggining of the quarantine I came to live with my boyfriend bc I know if I didnt see him often I would lose my mind and terrible things might happen. My college is trying to transform our courses in online courses, and is mainly succeeding. In the beggining I sort out everything I should do, to not leave everything to the last minute, so in the first weeks I worked like crazy and managed to anticipate the majority of my tasks. This leads me to last week. Last week I confirmed through my professors and schedules that I was ahead of almost everything. I read most of the texts, wrote most essays, made almost everything that I could do. I had almost no day to just relax or do only minor chores. So when I took my bullet journal to schedule last week and this current one, I saw that if I did one task per day I would be free to read my book and be concerned with other things, since college stuff would be done. So I distributed one task for each day untill the end of this week. But I CANT DO THEM! It is driving me crazy because it is only one simple task I must do that day, but I cant find ANY motivation to do them and now theyre accumulating! Im getting mad at myself because its just one stupid task! And I cant do it! And this lack of motivation is affecting other things. I cant wake up early to do my exercises anymore, I cant be happy doing lunch I loved to cook, but now its just an obligation, even my games and my books dont make me happy anymore! Im in a constant state of apathy and I hate this! And now Im concerned that because of this my boyfriend will think that Im just not happy around him bc of him, and thats not the problem at all. Sorry for the long post and thank you in advance for hearing me. I would really appreciate some support words.",

    "Low functioning depression Hi reddit. The title of this post is quite ironical as Ive spent the last 10 minutes making a new account just so I could post this anonymously, have had to get out of bed for it and have finally dedicated myself to doing at least something today. Nonetheless, I see this situation as a minor bright spot in my current life and desperately need advice regardless. I am a senior highschooler from a lowincome family in Europe. Ever since I was 13 or 14 years old Ive been struggling with some kind of selfdiagnosed I never went to therapy for many reasons depression andor anxiety. The causes of such problems have changed throughout the years, but they were mostly linked with social anxiety, unhealthy amount of selfimposed academic stress and god knows what else. My first two years of high school were marked by drenching amounts of anxiety regarding new acquaintances, extremely low self esteem, low functioning due to stress and frequent suicidal thoughts and wishes. Over time, my social anxiety went away, with it most of my problems, and for the last year I havent felt as close as bad as I did before. I thought my depression finally disappeared, and that Ive changed as a person. Now, I know I was wrong. At the moment I am experiencing a great deal of stress caused by university planning. Like previously mentioned, I live in a lowdeveloped European country in a lowmiddle class family. My biggest chance to do something with my life is to go to university abroad, as universities in my country are pretty much shit. Ive dedicated all of my elementary and high school education to university planning, constantly striving for good grades, many extracurriculars and additional tests. And now, when the time has finally come to apply for universities and write my damn personal essays and send them, I blocked. I cannot make myself to sit and write the essays, as I am a huge perfectionist and am probably scared to start writing as I fear they wont end up good. The more time passes, the more stressed I am, the harder it is to focus, and it all ends up being a great, vicious circle.",
    "Please Help: Spontaneous Suicide Attempts - 25 y/o Female I asked her if she was fully honest with her psychiatrist about her suicide attempts and her ideation, and she admitted that she has downplayed it. I told her that my dream is simply to grow old together, and that I would fight for her life with everything I have. I suggested that she schedule an emergency appointment with her psychiatrist to discuss her recent attempt, to be transparent about her actual ideation, and to push for more serious treatment, as her and my life truly depend on this. I also asked to join the meeting to provide my observations and ensure that the seriousness is truly conveyed she can be so friendly that she downplays negative things. She was totally open to this, and agreed that she needs to push for more serious treatment, since it is truly life or death. I am usually the one who steps in when some tough pushingadvocacy needs to be done, and I am now here to step up. This has become the most important thing in my life, and I am on a search for a solution. I just want her to survive, to live a peaceful, happy life, and I want to be there with her, until we get old. I know that the psychiatrist may have the answers, but this is too serious to put our lives in a single persons hands. Im begging you to please consider this, and to please make some suggestions about treatments we should raise with the doctor, or if there are certain doctors you think we should seek out. Is electroshock therapy something we should bring up, for example? Im fighting for her life, and will do anything to save her. She wants to be better, and is open to whatever is needed.

    "Some guys on reddit may have location info for \"nudes\" I posted and I am so close to ending it Long story short, I had anorexia and needed some body positivity. So, I uploaded images to flickr, turned off share exif data feature, and posted a before and after pic of my body, which ended up being a lot of chubby pics of me completely clothed but bikini. I was horrified to find out some scary captions were appearing and I could see it was being fetishized, which was not my intent really, I just wanted to feel better about myself because Ive felt like shit lately. 240 people viewed it and it was reposted to a sub for fat girls by another account, which was my mistake for putting the link on reddit where it could be crossposted in the first place. My exif data contained my location and phone, but Im not sure what else... Im terrified that they have my location data or serial number not sure if possible. I contacted Flickr and they CONFIRMED there was a glitch that showed my exif data. However, even so, seeing as I live in a college dorm, is there really any cause for worry if they have my phone model and location, if this is 5K miles from my real house, and the photo was not entirely sexual? Im deeply horrified and have had a panic attack all day. There were maybe 20 photos of me. You couldnt see my face or head or anything other than bust. How much should I be worrying about this? Photos were deleted and I am still in contact with flickr... but if a goddamn photo with my body and location is captioned i wanna X sexual thing im freaking tf out. is it even a nude if its just my bikinigt",
    "Husband triggered depression by sitting on bed with daughter So my father and I have had some innapropriate interactions over the years. Based on this and working in a field that is very aware of the high frequency of sexual abuse, I have tried really hard to raise my daughter with some modesty boundries to help protect her from grooming by predators. She is 14. At this age I have discussed this many times with my husband away from our daughter. He often gets what I would describe as vey chummy with her. Sitting very close, to do things, resting his arm on her leg and his voice changes pitch like he is playfully flirting and will even bat his eyes at her. I have repeatedly told him how uncomfortable it makes me and how the same behavior from my dad has really bothered me all these years and how horable it is to put a kid in a position to have to tell her father to give her space. Also it really triggers my depression. But, I would say the behavior has not stopped in any frequency. I am in a very bad bout of depression now. I started crying and tried to go to bed. But, they were on the bed looking at old photos. I walked out and walked back in to non verbaly hint that something was wrong. My husband acknowledged the look, but went back to what he was doing. I said I had to go to bed, it was very late. My hasband took our daughter and left, but I was so upset, I asked our daughter to please go to bed, it was getting pretty late. I did this because I wanted to talk privately with my husband about the issue. He exploded and says I am just poisoning my daughter against him. No concern about my depression or grooming concerns, just pure anger. He said he talked to his friends and everyone thinks I am trying to turn our daughter against him, based on this event.",

    "My (24) boyfriend (30) told me having a child is the only point of life and if he found out he was infertile, he would kill himself. He wants to see me pregnant and watch our child go to school and comfort them if they got bullied etc. He wants someone to take care of him when he gets old. Biologically, having a child is the only point of living and so having a child would cure his depression. I asked him what he would do if it turned out he was infertile and he point blank, no hesitation said he would kill himself. So that was extremely scary. I dont know what to do anymore. Ive tried to get him to go to therapy, but he sees absolutely nothing wrong with his worldview and i dont know how to convince him otherwise. Obviously, it is okay if we have to break up because our life paths are different, but honestly, hes done a lot of drugs weightliftingbodybuilding related and there is a very real possibility that hes infertile. I love him to pieces and will be crushed ifwhen we break up, but I dont know what i would do if he killed himself. Does anyone have any ideas for how to show him that the point of life is not only having a child? And yes, i did mention adoption which would provide the same tribe and care for him when hes old that hes so fixated on but he said he didnt want to adopt. Im just really worried and scared right now. Thank you all in advance. TLDR  my boyfriend thinks having a child is the only point to being alive and if he cant have a child he would just kill himself. I dont want a child but i also dont want him to kill himself. Help!",

All I want to do is go on facebook and tell everyone how sorry I am for being so embarrassing. Or go sit at my desk and work more so I have more to report on in the standup. Or go lay with my 4 year old son and tell him how proud of him I am and how great his Lego creation tonight was. Or clean and organize the whole house so my wife wakes up and feels good about being married to me. I get this frantic feeling like it all needs to happen, but its too late, the day is over, and I messed up again. I did not feel this way an hour ago when I laid down in my bed.

Im not motivated to do much or if I do have the motivation Im unsure of what to do. So the motivation lingers until its finally gone from my thoughts. Im not sure what Ill do with my life, Im barely living it. Im not a person that I would like to be and Im not focused on life. Ive been trying to make sense of how I feel. My friends dont speak to me, they straight out dont call or text and havent for months. Theyve never really called or texted much, so I question myself and our friendship. I have bad self esteem which makes things wonky. My life has been moderately fine, the colors are just drained. Im also failing and got no motivation for school as well! I know what I should be doing but I dont seem to care cause Im depressed. Yeah, so I got no idea what to do with life. Any advice thatd help me out?",
    "I need help.. So ive been down a lot lately, i usually buy oxy for the happy feeling. I could not get any so i bought Lenoltec 15MG caffeine, 300MG acetaminophen, 8mg Codeine. This is not the first time i resorted to this.. in 3 days ive taken 90 tablets. so that is about 30,000mg of acetaminophen. In Oct i did the same thing and ended up in hospital getting detoxed, that didnt stop me from doing it again nov and dec but over a longer period of time. but this time 90 tablets in 3 days, I am suicidal so i really dont care what happens to me.",
    "Depressed International Student; need help Hi, Ill try to explain my situation as best as I can and I will highly appreciate if you can read it completely. In any case, Ill try to summarize everything in a TLDR at the bottom. Thanks for your time. ampx200B I am an international student who is stuck overseas in my home country India due to COVID from the last one and half year. I am studying in a good university on a student loan which is huge. I come from a lowermiddle class family and my parents cant even speak English. My parents have very conservative Indian mentality and it is impossible for them to understand my situation. Just after my high school, I was selected into very prestigious engineering colleges in India called IIT. I studied there for an year and got super depressed as I came to understand how the real life is. I decided to take a transfer to a very good university in Australia. I thought it would make me feel better but it did come with a hefty student loan. I was a kid I guess, I dont think there is anything that can make me feel better. I am currently in my last year and working towards writing my honours thesis. I have been pretty stressed about general life and how exactly I will repay my loan and live a normal life. I have tried applying to a lot of internships but I got more than 50 rejections already and I have no more motivation to apply anywhere now. I dont feel anything at all. The only reason why I study or do any work is to get high marks. Thats it. Very recently last month or two, I have been even slacking off in the study part. I have also started smoking cigarettes and doing marijuana edibles every other day. Every day, I wake up at 10 already tired and swearing about everything in my mind, I live at my parents home rn. I attend a few zoom group project meetings, staying silent mostly and trying to look like I did the minimal amount of work to not get thrown out of the group. Then I try to feel better, make a huge list of assignments coming up and write down how much is each of them worth. I start working on something and feel it is totally pointless.",
    "How to help boyfriend with depression who won’t open up to me My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 2 years. We both have had our struggles with depression. Recently I see he has been feeling down once again. He doesnt want to go to a therapist because  he knows whats wrong, he just doesnt have the motivation to do anything about it. in his exact words I dont want to go to therapy because I see therapy as guidance method for improvement. I dont feel like I need guidance, my problem is one of will and circumstance, I dont doubt that I could benefit from it, but right now I see it as going out of my way to do something I dont prioritize Even though weve been together a while, he still does not feel comfortable opening up to me about how he is feeling. Ive asked him ways that I can help him feel better, or support him and he says that talking about it wont make him feel better. Is there anything I can do to help him? I hate seeing him be down like this and be unable to help him. Ive also tried giving him space and left him alone for a bit. Am I being selfish for trying to help him? Are there other things I should try to help him feel better? Any words of wisdom or advice would be greatly appreciated",
    "Advice? Im young and just dont feel like doing anything. I dont want to go out, eat, and it seems like no one is interested into talking to me. I listen to music all day and lay in bed. I dont feel like going to school any more and ask my parents if I can stay home and do it online. I recently moved schools and left all my old friends and now I literally have no one to talk to. I tried talking to my dad today but he was just shaking his head and agreeing with me no matter what I said. My step mom is acting like Im not even alive. My bio mom wont let me see my siblings, I try to and she says maybe next weekend she has said this since the beginning of this summer I Honestly dont know what to do at this point.",

My moms told me that I have a obnoxious personality, she doesnt know how she raised me to come out the way I did and that theres no wonder all my friends left me, and that when I go back to school Im not ever going to have any friends. So the basic question Im wondering is just... whats wrong with me? I can never stay happy for more then a few days before I fall into this loop of selfpity remembering all of the memories that we had. I just want to know what to do. I mean obviously I cant get attached to people the way I have been until they prove themselves by actions, but in order to get people to stay, they have to want to stay. So how do I become better?

    "Just so tired of being depressed Not really sure where to even start with this one... I just find that the only reason Im alive is simply because of my biological programming. I havent found any purpose to want to live, but the fundamental instinct to live is whats keeping me going. I have isolated myself from pretty much everyone and I have no meaningful emotional connections with people. I have never been emotionally or physically intimate with anyone and at this point I feel as though this is just the cards Ive been dealt, that the idea of having a meaningful connection with another person is almost too unrealistic to expect. I feel as though Ive wasted my time on this planet spending it alone, but then I find myself equally unhappy when I am around people. It seems like Im incapable of enjoying my own company or the company of others. I want to change this but whenever I open myself up to other people, it comes with emotional stress that I just dont know how to internalize. I know that if I continue down this road I am almost certainly committing myself to a life of isolating misery or suicide. I just dont know how to live any differently. And because this has been a theme for me so long, its become a part of my identity in a way to be depressed like this. It feels as though any attempt to change this underlying cause would be a betrayal to my true self or something. I want to change things, I dont want to commit myself to a life of isolation and apathy. I would like to have genuine and meaningful connections with people and feel like I have some sort of meaning in being alive.. But I just find that nothing makes me want to wake up the next morning. There is no underlying passion for life, just the motions. I have been to more therapists and psychiatrists than I can count on my hands, I just dont know what to do anymore. Apologize for the rant, this all just hitting me hard as of late.",

    "I hate myself, i need an outside perspective. I feel like a complete failure at everything i do. Everyone in my life says im so talented or that im smart or have potential but every time i hear someone say that it makes me want to shoot myself in the fucking face. Whenever i hear these things my ego just gets bigger and it gives me a reason to think  Maby im not so bad which i then immediately disprove by doing some other stupid shit, i cant get get relationships right, im pretty sure my girlfriend is slowly loosing interest in me, and i dont blame her, i would too. Im not good at sex and fail to pleasure my partner, im terrible at work and am constantly overshadowed by new employees despite my seniority, im failing all my classes at school and i havnt spoken to my friends at all recently due to a lack of motivation. I feel like im looking in on the world from outside a glass door, and i hate it, i hate myself, i hate every decision that i make, will make, or have made, and i wish nothing but the worst upon myself. Im at a point where i do all of these things and feel no remorse, i feel no sadness, im just an empty sad excuse for a man looking for my next momentary shot of dopamine to keep me from loosing my mind and realizing what a piece of shit i am.

    "Am I a wuss? So Ive been living with my roommatefriend for like half a year. I think Im a decent enough roommate I clean up after myself, help out, blah blah blah. Anyway I was making dinner for us. She chopped up the pasta sauce ingredients and I made the sauce and pasta. So basically I used too much pasta for the amount of sauce I had. Honest mistake I think tell me if Im wrong please!. She got frustrated and lashes out. Essentially calling into question me as a man and as a cook. bottom line was I got hurt and ended up crying. Now this worries me for a few reasons. The last time I was too sensitive about being insulted was around the time I had a breakdown. Basically it felt like my emotions were sunburned and any little negative comment pushed me over. Also those kinds of things attacking my manhood and pretty much anything negative about me has been a sort of depression mantra when Im upset lots of negative thoughts rolling out at once. My question is this is it possible Im too easily triggered? Or maybe the particular subject matter was a significant trigger? Or maybe am I just a wuss and therefore not much of a man?",

Although I have helped her a lot in the past with her depression, and she has always told me that she is there for me, Im still really nervous about asking for help. Id start typing a message but then end up deleting it. I feel like Im losing my mind and I need to talk to someone. What do I do?",
    "My friends doesn't believe in be and doesn't respect my wish to be alone for a while Yesterday I saw her big brother on the street and I kinda had to say hello to him. Yesterday was the same day I startet therapy, so I looked like a mess  was a little embaressed because hes god damn beautiful and has always flirted with me. I told him to say hello to ST, tell her shes missed and that she shouldnt be worried because Ill still keep my promise and get back when Im ready to be social again. yearh, because I knew he would tell her he saw me.... 5hours later she texted me twice Hey, Im SO WORRIED! I need to know that youre okay?Hey, just like my message  you dont have to write a long message or anything Im a mix between angry and understanding. maybe shes concerned that Ill take my life again? And this is her way to show love  just showed through concern? but Im SO angry for the fact that she doesnt trust in me? Her concern makes me so angry... Ive already messaged her TWO TIMES even though I told her I wouldnt answerany messages. Telling her Im fine and that Ill get back. Can she just leave me the f alne and believe that Im doing fine, taking one small step at a time. THIS is one of the reasons why I had to take a break from people. If I believe in their concern about me not getting better, I wont be better. The last time my dad told me he though I would kill myself  I wasnt having some selfharming thoughts. But then I started having them  just to prove that he was right. I wont let this selfdestructive way of pleasing get in touch with me again. And being away from people, only having contact with my mom, has changed my habits into being able to wake up, going outside, making food once in a while and start to work on my traumas. But know, because of her messages, I fear I get stuck in the believe of not recovering. I know its not her wish, but thats how it affects me... My therapy sessions is mainly about relations.",
    "Tired of Choosing between Bills and Food Hey everyone, I posted this in rfinancialhelp As well but this is also really taking a hit to my sanity.. Im really having a difficult time getting my finances in order. Back in January my fiancée 21F and I 21M moved into our first apartment. Ever since then we have been struggling to get money to save and even pay our bills. We both work full time and both make over minimum wage where we live. Honestly I dont really know how else to say this so Im just going to say it how it is. She comes from a wealthier family and sometimes has trouble with spending habits. This is something that we have both discussed and its something that she agrees is an issue. Right now we are both in debt she used my credit card without my knowledge for a while and also promised she would pay me back whenever she did ask me to use it, which didnt happen, and now I feel really cornered with my finances. Ive been trying to pay the debt off for months but we struggle to even get enough for our monthly bills. Aside from that we dont even have much food either and I dont eat much as a result. Im just really struggling with this right now because I want us to be able to start saving money and be able to afford things and starts saving and investing but with the debt and the money issues we are facing it just feels kind of impossible right now. Any advice is welcome. IMPORTANT NOTE The apartment we live in is well within our budget, we didnt choose to live somewhere really fancy.",

My doctor sticks me on just any medication at all, I cant have counselling, my mum doesnt even like me anymore, my only friends getting tired of me, my sister doesnt think any medication will help and I know shes got her best interest at heart but what else can I do. I dont feel real anymore I just want to be me again. I thought it was being unemployed that made it bad but I have a job now and I feel even worse. Ive called the suicide line a few times and the only time its helped has been once and every other time Ive been mocked or talked down to. I sound like the most self centred asshole whos just spoilt and doesnt see what I have I know. I have that chance to get counselling and the chance to get medication at all and for free.

We developed a code word for him to let me know when he feels that way and he likes me to sit with him at those times but I know we need more help. He doesnt want to go back to counseling even with a different counselor and we have talked to his Dr who wants him to try using some strategiescopinglife changes. He is kinda willing to go through a book with me and asks why he should go to a counselor because he can talk to me, doesnt know a counselor well enough to trust them, his past counselor didnt help, and in general dismisses all my answers that include they are professionals, counseling has helped me, counselors can be trusted, we can interview a couple different therapists, science backs counseling etc. Help me find a not cheesey workbook, toolkit book, etc for us to go through. Ideally one that would be good for a teen. Hes not super on board with improving sleep, etc so if a book gives good logic hed be more open to it than me or his Dr suggesting it. We are liberal science embracing Christians so open to books with or without a Christian perspective but science based is must. Thanks, A worried mom",
    "Therapist suggested medication - what to expect I have expressed to my therapist that no matter what I do  exercise, keep in shape, work hard  nobody will ever convince me that I am worth anything. nobody. I just see it  I am so fucking worthless and every day I have to make a mental list when i wake up about why is not the day I should kill myself usually fear, or lack of a good method. I explained to her that every time I see my reflection in a window, a mirror, see my photo, etc. I am convinced I have to be removed from society for the good of it and that there has never, ever been a person that was born as worthless as me. That every situation I am ever in I consider myself the most worthless person in the room, and therefor there is no reason to keep living each day. I am all alone and nobody likes me, which is further reinforcement of the idea that I am worthless. After all, what is something that nobody wants? Trash. And what do you do with trash? Discard it. I feel like medicine is giving up. I feel like it is just a mask for my problems. It doesnt MAKE me a person of worth that people will naturally gravitate to my standard for being worthwhile. It would just distract me from the utter despair and sense of desperation that is part of being a person of no value. This is why Im opposed to medication. It doesnt fix the problem. The only way I see out of this problem is to become a highvalue person or to remove myself from the world. I am not sure what to do. Ive never taken any psychotropic medicine before. But I am running out of time to make myself a highvalue person I set a deadline of 3 months. This is because Im 40 and alone and, even though I was married and in a LTR for 12 consecutive years, Ive been alone for 1.5 years now and I consider it a massive personal failure.

    "Depressed Partner (quarantine) Hi! F29 M29 My partner of 2 years asked me for space on Thursday after his therapist appointment. He said he didnt want to make any rushed decision breakup until he had a more clear view of things. We had just moved in together in January and now he isnt sure if he was ready. He has been struggling with being stuck at home, no sports on tv, and me nagging him to get out of the house with me for walks or just even eating in our patio. I had no background or knew how to deal with depression so I cried and made him feel responsible for what he was feeling. He said he was confused and didnt know if the quarantine or our relationship where the real cause of his depression. I left but didnt even hug him. I made some research and felt so gulty of not being compassionate to him and went back on Friday to beg him to trust me. He said he still needed time but that everything I had said helped him. I stayed away but reading everything I could, joined TalkSpace which has helped me a lot and felt very connected with people going through the same thing. I slowly realized his illness made him so unworthy of love that he felt that me being out of his life would help him. I kept on sending text of encourganmet once a day and have food, essentials deliveries to the house the quarantine does not help. Today I came over in the morning and let our dog out and fed her. He was still in bed, I came in the room hugged him and reassured I would always be here. He had a drainedsad look on his face but hugged me back. I said I LOVE YOU and he could bearly get the words out. I then left..... I just need some help knowing things will pass. Ive done evrything I can and all left its to wait.

    "I just told my parents that I had depression, it didn't go well at all. No matter from where you are and which century you got born in, problems such as depression doesnt leave the world, everyone can get depression depending on the situation that they are having. My Iraqi parents went through alot when they were in Iraq, they went through tough wars and time where they dont have food or water. They moved out of the country to Dubai, where I got born and raised in. We all know that depression can cause people to suicide, but my parents had another thoughts.

Going through al of that made me go insane and depressed, i reached out for help ofc, it helped abit but not that much, so I had to relay on myself, and heal myself. And thankfully, im doing well nowadays. I decided to adopt a cat recently, because first i like cats alot, and second, i read alot of researches that says pets can help people with depression. My dad is an animal guy, so he doesnt mind at all. But my mom has allergy and asthma, so convincing her is pretty hard. Today, I told my mom i had depression, and if adopt a cat it would help me alot to avoid the same senario. Instead of asking why I had depression and what caused it, she decided to say smth rude, which was You getting depression because of school pressure and you wanting a cat is all a girl thing, dont be a girl and man up At that moment I felt that smth pinched my heart and I just wanted to leave the house to somewhere else, she made me feel as if my problem didnt exist and i was faking it just to get a cat, i was soo offended and now im scared that ill get depressed again.

    "Was it just a phase or is it depression? I have depression and schizophrenia I also have dreams of being a successful music artist. Id like to be a singersongwriter, musician, and producer. Id like to play multiple instruments such as guitar, piano and bass. But I dont know how to achieve this goal. Being depressed I dont feel like doing anything And making music is no longer pleasurable to me. I read somewhere you must practice 1.5 to 2 hours a day on one instrument to see results. I cant do that... I can barely play guitar or piano for 15 mins. I also gave up on the bass guitar. Before Id just play for hours and write songs No matter if it was utter shit. I was dedicated. My goal seems impossible but then I look at multitalented artists such as Prince, FKJ, Mac Demarco, or Kevin Parker. So it lets me know its possible just very hard for me to accomplish. Maybe I should stop trying to be like them and be who I am meant to be...but damnit... I bought all these instruments I started making music when I was 13. Im 27 now. I spent many years believing I would have a career in music and never had a breakthrough. Now, since I have depression and all my musical instruments and gear appear to be useless junk, I wish I had fell in love, gotten married and had children. Even learn to drive and get a well paying job. I had bad anxiety growing up so it prevented me from certain aspects of life. Music gave me strength and purpose. Now Im just lost in life and not sure if things will get better. Im currently on disability for my schizophrenia I was diagnosed around 23 and am currently looking for a part time job. Im a late bloomer in life. I even still live with my mother. Shes been my caretaker. So now Im learning to live without music. Its very hard. I dont know who I am anymore.

It was a huge struggle for many years, but now, I find it easy not to do both those things. Potentially having someone to sleep with has helped me not relapse, however, I have not felt any benefits of Nofap and its frustrating. I was depressed before, Im depressed now. I had no motivation before, I have none now. The only reason I keep going is because of my will power.. and I feel at my breaking point. I am educated, with a stable job now and a wonderful girlfriend and friends who all love me. I count those blessings daily, but its so difficult because I am very negative. No positive thoughts run through my mind, just negative ones and negative memories. My SO and I have sex almost daily, but its hard for me to get hard. She excites me greatly, but its difficult for me to have sensation there or to will myself to get hard because I have thoughts like I am too small or I remind myself she has had sex before me and Im just so in my head, she wants me to be dominant but I really act submissive. I work out, I am extremely fit. I am very physically attractive according to many people, I have a lot of charm as people love to point out to me. Why dont i see any of it? why do i not like myself? i dont have a semblance of a identity and my brain is so foggy. I discussed with my therapist, and Meds are on the table but i dont think that will help me be more confident with myself... i cant meditate for long because my thoughts are just so painful. I am very introverted.any one can help me with any of this? or just to cheer me up? I am an introvert who wants to learn to be more social and just to relax and have control of my thoughts.",
    "My best friend's depression is triggering mine. What do I do? Ive been depressed for years and hated all the thoughts of suicide that were stuck in my head. A month ago I finally opened up to my parents, things have brightened up, I seeked professional help last week, and might have some counseling with my fam soon. Ive reconnected with people Ive missed, and Im really trying my hardest to stop feeling depressed. Ive even started reading up on meditation and such. My doc and I are still thinking about the meds though. But my bestfriend...is suicidal and depressed, Ill call them John for now. He regularly has the urge to selfharm, skip meals, or do reckless things. And regularly talks about wanting to die and how he wants to do it. Ive given him a lot of advice and Ive done my best to remind him that Im always here. But....its starting to feel like he never takes any advice I give and that hes given up on himself already. He already seeked help long before I ever did but he hates his meds cuz he thinks it just forces him to be happy. Hes an online friend so I cant approach him face to face. Ive known him for so long and I know thats hes a good person and that he doesnt deserve this. He wants a better life where hes free from his family...so I recommended some small job offerings to keep him stable but he doesnt want to commit to it. I recommended he find some hobbies...but he doesnt want to. I told him to try making new friends, he says he already has me... I tried to explain why that wouldnt be healthy and he seemed to try to say that other people will just hurt him...but Im not perfect... I cant provide for all of his emotional needs... I barely have control of my own. I cant help but feel the need to play strong just so he has someone to lean on. I want to finally start thinking about myself and relax...but everytime I do I feel like Im leaving him behind.",

    "Should I go live on Reddit? So I have been having trouble connecting with the outside world and it is starting to affect me. My therapist has encouraged me to try to reach out to online communities. I try to, but I mostly just sit on the sideline and watch. I am thinking of going live on here and try to reach out. It would be a big step even if i only get like one or two watchers. I am just scared and need some encouragement I guess. Thank you for reading.",
    "(just turned 18) about to be homeless. i’m so scared. please help me due to being depressedsuicidal for the past year, my grades have slipped and I am now academically dismissed from my college. This is completely my fault and I am so angry at myself. I live with my asian family and once they find out, I know that theyll beat me up and kick me out of the house. I am so scared.

    "I'm begging someone for support rn. Anyone I can honestly say Im at the lowest point in my life rn. Im a 26M, and Ive crashed and burned everything, destroyed every relationship in my life, and live in complete isolation. Ive had crippling depression and panic disorder ever since I was a child, and Ive never been so alone in my life. A mixture of substance abuse, panic, and depression has made it difficult to continue. I honestly dont expect anyone to truly gaf, but even to just pretend would give me a sense that Im not alone. Ive lived in poverty my entire life, my family was dirty and parents addicted to drugs, I was continuously sexually abused, and its created an endless amount of deep rooted issues in my mind. I also have severe bipolar disorder, and because of it I push everyone away with my craziness. My father left me when I was 4, my entire family except for my mom admitted they wanted me aborted. This includes my grandparents, aunts, etc. I was homeless with my mother, living in a car for the first 6 years of my life. Id had it by the time I was 13. I was never home, would stay at friends houses for weeks at a time, wander the streets, because going home was torture. Constant violence, fighting, yelling and neglect, with police constantly showing up at the house. My family never fed me, and I basically had to beg friends for food. At 13, I started using drugs because I was finally accepted by my friend group. I was constantly high, and everyone in school warned people to stay away from me. I was in and out of juvy, and literally the cops arrested me in the middle of class when I was 17, and I was expelled. My family disowned me, and my aunt was kind enough to let me stay with her until I was 18. It was the greatest act of kindness Ive ever known. At age 16, my met my first gf, and I jumped headfirst. I was wholeheartedly convinced she was the woman I was going to marry.",
    "My Heart Feels Like It's Emotionally Bleeding Just a quick one because Im at work currently. On mobile. I feel like I have an average amount to be proud of, especially considering how far Ive come in a short time. I used to be a failure, honestly. I was on medical financial benefits, boyfriend dumped me not nastily I might add but he was my world, had no desires for my future because I think I honestly believed that I couldnt achieve anything. Not gonna go into too much detail about my current partner because hes not reeeeeally the subject here. But I will say that he came into my life abruptly as a friend of the person I was staying with, and literally turned my life around. More than anything, Im thankful to him for showing me that I am strong enough. I have a job through him he moved from South to North of my country and dropped into a job, a few months later putting the good word in for me and getting me an interview and has reminded me of what purpose of life means... We have recently reserved a new, gorgeous build in the town we have come to love, and the coming month we will be reserving it. I can finally get a corgi my favourite dog breed, if the name doesnt give it away haha and my life has some substance. I will have a house, a dog, a loving partner and lots of friends, as well as a hobby that I love. I can buy games for my Switch and have a generously donated, very decent graphics tablet to draw on. So... Why it be like this? I have moodswings. I feel horribly low and numb and then just... Numb, which I recognise at the time is better than low. I get horribly self destructive I have wished many times as recent as this last month to hurt myself out of frustration, I only dont because I cannot stand breaking my partners heart, I cry, I feel hopeless. Yes, I have some happiness but Im so used to feeling numb. Empty. Why? I want to get off my meds, I want to feel at the very least normal, not nothing and empty. I dont want to constantly worry.",
    "Suicide note Ive been trying to write my suicide note for about a week now and i cant think of anything to put on it. Whenever i look up ideas on google i get the usual bullshit like you are loved or they try to tell you to just keep it to yourself in other words a fake suicide note you use to vent like if i were loved i wouldnt be trying to write my suicide note. Honestlh its not like it matters if i leave a note no one will read it just like no one ever readshears my pleas for help, or my attempts to just have a conversation with them, my friends ignore me, support sites ignore me, whenever i try to make friends on a friend sub everyone ignores my commentsposts and if they dont they ghost me after a few messages. No one gives a shit about me when im alive why would they care when im dead? Im not looking for fake people cares or i cares im sick of strangers telling me they care when theyve never met me because if they did they wouldnt care.

    "I want to make a mental health channel on YouTube, but don't feel qualified... Let me start by saying, Im not in it for the views. Just that, recently I did a vlog after jotting down some things that help me when Im depressed. It felt sort of cathartic to write down things that help me, and hope it could help other people. My problem is I feel like what Ill contribute will be generic, or not very helpful since everyone deals with depression differently. ampx200B Im not making this post to advertise my channel. throwaway acc Im just unsure I should post because I dont feel quite qualified to talk about the content. Sorry if this isnt entirely relevant to the subreddit.",
    "I have given up This is a throw away account, obviously.. I dont know what to do at this point. I do everything that is supposed to help me get better, such as eating 3 healthy meals a day, exercising, spending time with others, going to therapy, taking antidepressants ect.. yet I still want to end my life. I want to die.. Holding all of these suicidal thoughts in my head every day and hurting so badly feels like it is driving me insane. Im so tired. I dont want to live. The last time I felt this alone was when I had my last suicide attempt.",
    "Still hurting from betrayal I posted awhile back but I am still having trouble and I would appreciate the support. My 26M ex gf 26F cheated on me and left me for some guy she had only known for 3 weeks. I loved her so much. We had been together for almost 7 years. We had plans to get married and buy a home together. To travel together have kids and start a family together She abandoned me and the dog we raised together for some low life with no career or education that pursued her knowing we were in a committed relationship. It hurts. There are so many memories of the good times we spent together. I was so close with her family. She had always said she couldnt imagine her life without me. Now shes off with this horrible person acting like theyre soulmates. I know I deserve better than someone who would cheat on me and lie about it. I am just still having trouble believing she actually did this to me and that shes gone and never coming back. I was such a good boyfriend. I made her breakfast in bed and surprised her with dinner when she had a late shift. I would plan special surprises for the holidays and birthdays. Yet she still cheated on me and left me. I go from sad to angry to depressed to sad again. I dont really know what to do. Thanks for taking the time to read and comment. I know there are a lot of people out there going through hard times.",
    "The Story of This Year I cried everyday, I never left my room, I avoided everything and everyone. There was parties in my house and I just laid in my room and cried while the world went by. It may sound ridiculous but I havent had a great life and the smallest things get to me. After the month, I kinda got over the overdose and went about my days. Life started getting a bit better again, there were more smiles and laughter. One of my house mates during the time we lived together was terrible with money. He gets paid at 1230am every Sunday and goes out every Saturday night so usually he spends all his pay as soon as it comes in on drinks. Because of this, my room mates and I had to cover his rent and food throughout the week. This lasted for a few months. Things started getting worse with the guy, he gets very angry and started masking his problems with drugs specifically weed. He would go out everyday and get really high so he didnt have to deal with his problems, my room mates and I were getting very broke trying to support him and it got to the point we couldnt anymore. He never paid us back after countless promises and he never did anything around the house. One night we got into a massive fight and I kicked him out, we stayed friends and we spoke all the time and we learnt it was better this way. We became closer not living together because we didnt have the tension and added stress. Im sorry this story jumps a lot, theres so much content that I cant really focus I didnt realise till after I kicked him out how much I spent time with him. My other two room mates were sleeping together since the start and they would spend 60 of their time in bed. Because of this, the room mate I kicked out and I got really close because we only had each other. After kicking him out I was very lonely. I dont deal well with being alone and I constantly need company so I feel okay. The male room mate out of the 2 that were sleeping together ended up finding another girl he liked and he spent a lot of time with her which left me and the girl to get very close.",
    "Felt like I just should die, even if I don't want to. Not to feel better about myself, but because I want to help as many people as I can and I know that it could help. It might not always work or be the better thing to do in some situations or for some people but I cannot know everybodys lives and everyones situation and as a highly sensitive person too, I am ALWAYS trying to writespeak in the way of not trying to hurt anyone, to be as kind as possible I am a kind person actually, so I try to be it even if I feel like I just want to die and so on. I was feeling like a total mess last night because of the comments of this girl, because she was really telling me that I was like kind of guilty of giving not any advice but like, I was helping people to get killed in some way. She did not actually say that but I really take it badly and I still feel like, because of what she told me a total stranger, yes I treated myself like I was right to believe that I should kill myself because I was just a piece of shit to the world and because I was angry too and really bad, at a moment, by brother tried to told me a joke that wasnt funny and I just talked to him really really badly so he got the impression that I didnt even deserved to be talked to and left. To some point, Ive been crying for hours, feeling suicidal, and even went to my mom who just told me to stay away from internet yes at that point, but it was just some girl on reddit but, still and I felt terrible because I dont have any real good support anywhere in real life. I dont even know why I am posting that, I guess I need it out of my chest, and was in research of kind words, and good people. I dont know if anyone would even comment or saw my post, but well. Even if I dont have a plan to kill myself and dont want any of course, I feel like I should die and I am so tired of feeling this way. I know I dont deserve that because I am a kind person and a loving person who cares a lot. I tried to post this on another sub but while I was writing, I guess I just should post it here.",
    "We were engaged. He left me for a 19 year old he has been talking to online for the past 3 months They only saw each other in person once at the time, had each other added on Snapchat ever since, but never talked. When the Tokyo Olympics finally started, she posted a story on Snapchat about Brazil losing in a game of volleyball or something, thats what he told me at least. Since him and I always watched the games together when we could, he knew about it and replied to her story making a joke. Theyve been talking ever since. He told her about me and our story, that we were engaged, etc, and she thought it was awesome and asked to follow me on Instagram. I accepted it. She was extremely nice to me in the beginning and also replied extremely fast. After a few days talking on there she asked me for my WhatsApp number. Ill confess that I didnt really want to give her because I barely knew her and I dont like giving my number to random people. But I didnt want to be rude so I ended up giving her my number and we started talking there. After just a little while talking on WhatsApp, she asked me if we wanted to do a video call with her us 3. I thought she was moving way too fast with intimacy with us, but I asked my fiancé if he wanted to and he said it was up to me. I ended up accepting it. It was actually nice and we called once or twice more. Well, so this situation of her being friends with us lasted for about a month, but around the beginning of October I started being suspicious about some things with the two. We used to call every night before I slept Im at GMT3 and hes at GMT5, and he started giving excuses to go to sleep earlier because he was feeling sick, tired, etc, and I believed him. Well, all those times he was ending our call earlier to call her for 3 hours straight. They also called at other times during the day that I never knew about.",
    "Does this qualify as depression? Recently a pattern in my behavior has become very clear to me. Whenever I dont have a structure in my schedule to keep me busy, out of the house, and socializing, I begin to fall apart. My hygiene suffers, I sometimes go a week without showering or brushing my teeth. The amount of dry shampoo I use is scary. I always end up binging, with food and television. I was doing great all summer with a healthy diet, exercising, losing weight. Then my summer job ended. Now I spend the majority of my time watching show after show and mindlessly eating while I do it. Whenever im alone in the house and not distracting myself with food, tv, or porn I just end up pacing around, staring out the window melancholically like a antidepressant tv ad. Ive had a therapy consultation at my college where we primarily discussed my potentially having ADHD and my struggles with feeling guilty about my academic underperformance. I mightve gotten to talking about whether Im depressed, but I never actually had a session, they were booked until the end of the year. Im just looking for some answers, thinking about trying to find a therapist, but the only local source has had many questionable testimonials.",
    "Pl help.I am very emotionally fragile. I hate who I am right now. umm..this is my first post on reddit and I havent been a stable emotional state for quite sometime now. so...coming to the details, I18F am having a lot of insecurities, self esteem and confidence issues and I guess all this started during high school, when I was at the bottom of the class and i began to feel inferior to my peers and no matter how hard I tried I still couldnt catch upI was a straight A student before high school. and then came college. well, college isnt that bad. I have always been a very emotional person and I experience a lot of mood swings. So lately i have been quite down and stressed as I am very anxious about my careerstill clueless. and as a result I havent been able to control my emotions. It feels like Im walking on thin ice and anyone,literally anyone, can make a small remark and shatter and Im back to drowning in a cold sea of emotions. I spend a lot of time crying. I just have no control over it. I want to stop crying, i tell my self to stop crying and i cant and its so goddamn frustrating. It makes me feel weakI am already physically weak and underweight. I know expressing emotions and letting it out is healthy, but what if you are feeling so emotionally saturated with all the self hate and worries that youd cry to anything. I at least wish i had enough control so i wouldnt cry in front of someone who is not close. but nope. I have zero control. let me quote this one incident. a few days ago, I snapped at my elder brother when he was pressuring me to do learn things for my career. He kept forcing his point and it made me feel small and incompetent and like he doesnt trust my decisions on what I wanted to learn so I began to get all defensive and I very rudely told him off and avoided him ever since. I spent a lot of time crying and affected by it.",
    "I feel like im worthless and alone. Please help I posted this on another sub but I couldnt crosspost. Im just looking for help. Im 19 almost 20 and i feel like Ive accomplishment nothing in life at all. My story is the following. I was born in Mexico to a single mother and brought to the US when i was one year old. My mom got married to this man and every since I have memory this man has treated me terribly. Ive been told that he treated me well I was a baby but I dont remember any of it. I used to be beaten almost everyday by this man and its left scars in my mental state. He would beat me for the most absurd things. He beat me because i didnt all my multiplications, he beat me because I couldnt hold a chicken while he killed the poor thing, he beat me because I wasnt strong enough to help him do some mechanic things. He would tell me that I was useless and worthless. This has left a pretty big scar. And the worst thing of all is that mom wouldnt do anything and i didnt know why. I thought everyone just hated me. I just want someone to tell me that they are proud of me. Im going to college, I have a job, I have a girlfriend that I love, Im paying my rent and bills but even though I do have all of this I still feel worthless and useless. I feel alone and unwanted, hated by everyone. This leaves me to sob alone in the night because I dont know if even deserve living. This has lead to many attempt suicides. I just want to know if Im truly worthless and useless. Am i truly hated? I just want to hear someone say they are proud of me...",
    "I feel fed up please listen to me? Hi, Since a young age I had a big need to be in showbiz. I was part of the chorus in school and did some plays. People thought I was good. Sadly it went nowhere like I had no family with connections. I made this friend who was a child actor but he had the looks and I lacked that department. Years later, I am living in the USA struggling the same thing and being older. I love to act. I really do. I try a lot but I cant do an American accent and people dismiss me or even make fun of me. I keep trying to reach out to people to make projects and I get ghosted. I moved to a big city to get opportunity and it is so competitive with crappy entry level jobs. I have done so many labor gigs to be able to survive, worked 24 hours straight and 0 acting opportunity. I have a job that gives me little freedom working 6 hours for 6 days a week and even there upper management writes me up for petty things when I work so hard and can lose that job anytime. I dont like anything else other than acting and it is me, all alone. I have a few friends but they deal with their own issues like alcoholism and such. I see people on my social media or my friends friends who get acting opportunities in indie films and such and they do things that I could and makes me wonder... Why they dont cast me for anything? What is wrong with me? I have been to acting classes and I have barely gotten any feedback. I hear things like my accent or before Ive heard I was chubby and ugly and I fixed it since I am fit now and put some fillers. It is just I feel nobody values me... It is easy to think so since my very own parents abandoned me and wanted no responsibility. Any comfort would help please.",
    "Do people actually care? Sorry for the title, but it really is the best way to put it. Everyone says they care about me, want me to live, to message them if I ever feel like doing it. But Ive noticed a pattern, those same people talk about me behind my back, those same people often want me alive, but not necessarily around. My question is this, am I right to think that people as a whole are a lot more fake and cold than theyre willing to admit? Because I see a lot of words being said but Ive yet to meet someone who I actually believe cares. This post may seem self centered but I ask it out of frustration, I try my best to fight through it, for others. To be there for others. To care for others. Yet I struggle to find evidence of reciprocation besides empty words. The only reason Im alive today is because I promised I wouldnt hurt those around me by doing it, but Im feeling like they wouldnt actually care?

I have been skipping classes due to lack of motivation, anxiety, and fear. I dont think my mother believes I have depression, and still thinks it is the cause of my medication As the person who has the illness, I can tell its not just the medicine. She gets angry at me for skipping classes, Rightfully so, but it still hurts because Im not doing this for attention or laziness and wants to talk to my guidance counselor and teachers. I know they are going to put it on me, because I am the one whos been skipping and not asking for help. Im trying to attend as much as I can and get assignments done, but its never enough. Its true this is my fault, but I feel like they dont understand that Im not doing this out of laziness Im doing it because I want to off myself and cant take this anymore.

    "How to talk to doc? Hi all. 24 M here and around thanksgiving I finally did something about my depression and mentioned it to my primary care doc. Long story short I take 100 mg sertraline daily now and things have gotten noticeably better over those months, but i now am seeing a trend that frightens me a little. I know mood swings can be a side effect of a lot of antidepressants, but Im finding myself more prone to flying off the handle into fits of anger super quickly. Not too much more often, but Im way easier to set off, and I quickly become unhinged, to the point Im afraid honestly. Yesterday I had a moment I had to sit because I got so worked up i was afraid Id hurt my dog he was running away outside , which I never ever want to do. I went and cried had a long think after that.

    "Forcing yourself to do things you normally love during depression Im in the midst of a 5 week bout with depression, which for me has nothing to do with sadness. Rather, depression for me is a horrifying head fog that disconnects me from all emotions, interests and appetites. All I can feel is the fear and anxiety of being in this state of mind. If you suffer from this flavor of depression, or any flavor, do you force yourself to do the things your normally love even though you cant connect with that feeling of enjoyment? For me, doing this and not getting the reward makes it all worse, but I also dont wanna wait around to feel better to do these things, If that makes any sense. What do you do in this situation? Thank you! !",
    "I don't know what to do at this point other than end it. Nothing has helped so far. I have no personality or sense of self, either. I live with an overlying sense of guilt that I am at fault and that I deserve to be hurt, or worse. I have no hobbies and no interests, and never have. I do not enjoy anything I do in the slightest. To cope with not feeling anything, I have kinda reckless sex, hurt myself, and binge drink. I also occasionally smoke weed. The way my mom has treated me has ended up with me being diagnosed with borderline personality disorder BPD. After a hospitalization at 15, I was diagnosed with adolescent borderline personality disorder, so I have had it for a while now. Several therapists said I showed all traits by the age of 13 but couldnt diagnose me because of my young age. Anyways, moving on. So firstly, Im living with completely untreated BPD. The nearest specialist is an hour and a half away, and I have really bad insurance. My disability checks were taken away when I turned 18 last year, and my mom gets mad at me when I try to call to ask to fix this. My life is a living hell. I feel nothing at all, but at the same time, I feel everything at once. There is a void that I cant fill no matter how hard I try and Im in agony. Suicide is always on my mind, every hour of every day. I hurt myself often and binge drink to deal with the stress, or occasionally have reckless unsafe sex or smoke pot. When I was first brought to therapy, my therapist and psychiatrist had evaluated me for autism spectrum disorder and ADHD, and tried to refer me to a specialist. My mom screamed in his face that her perfect child could never be autistic. I have never been evaluated again, but have talked to my school counselor. She says Im most likely living with untreated ADHD or autism spectrum disorder, but most MOST likely both at once. My brother, who is emotionally and intellectually disabled, has both of these. So does my dad. Its in my genetics.",
    "I’ve been feeling down lately Hello reddit. I dont know if Im lazy or depressed, but over the past few weeks Ive been feeling empty. I feel so emotionally numb and I started to lose interest in things I used to enjoy, like playing video games. Im in high school, and Im so overwhelmed by homework because of the pressure that I have to do them perfectly. So much that I just dont want to do anything at all. My parents call me lazy, but I really dont know if thats true. So I looked up what depression was, and I was like yep, I probably have this, but my mind is going back forth from thinking Im depressed or faking it. Its confusing because Im still able to carry out tasks like chores, but at the same time I feel like I only do it because I have to. I also easily get upset over little things, like when my parents try to lecture me. It reminds me that Im a failure. A bad child. And Ill never be enough for anyone. Then I start beating myself up because of it, because that was my only coping mechanism. I would just punch my own arm or hand to release that energy. It hurts, but I dont care. I can still enjoy some things, like painting. But eventually that enjoyment goes away, and I go back to that feeling. I ruminate over past social interactions, and I just sit down and do nothing. Ive always been tired and lacked energy, but I think its because I dont get much sleep. But another thing is, I get hyper around my friends, which is why I have these conflicting thoughts about depression. Sometimes, I would unexpectedly start to fidget and do everything quickly, but that energy goes away when Im alone. My mood goes up a but all those thoughts and feelings come back eventually. I cannot afford therapy, nor want my parents to be involved. Im not an adult yet either, but I feel like I need help. Does this sound like depression? If not, then what is it?",
    "I think it's time for me I have really lost it. The way I act and my brain works it is completely gone wrong. I cant fix it or control my actions. I can not help it. I just want to be normal. Boring. Nothing. Just work and die. Im sick of the way I act and what I say or do. It seriously makes me sad I am this way. I think i am giving up and sooner than later I think i might just end it. I have no idea what is wrong with me. I have completely lost it and just feel pathetic with what I am. I dont think whatever I do to improve my appearance or career will ever help my mental. I am fundamentally broken,i was hit on the head as a child, not even a day old with a football. It is lucky I am even alive but I just feel like there is nothing in my skull it is completely empty. I dont ever want to see anyone or anything again. I just want darkness. Emptiness. Something that switches off my brain and I am in the empty void.",
    "I can’t make it stop I have reoccurring thoughts and day dreams of ending it. Day and night just seeing myself downing my stash of pills before going to bed or copying 13 reasons and going out in the tub. It helps to have distractions like personal time or gaming but its getting harder to focus on hobbies projects and stuff like that. I feel like Jack Nickelson in Over the Coo Coos Nest or Shining. I dont trust the places I have left to vent. Reddit always buried my posts for help which reeeeaaaly helps with the invisible feeling and the only people I feel confident enough to confined in are too busy. In a fucked up sense I dont want to go into therapy other than lack of funds because I could be taking time from the therapist helping someone... worth it. If that makes any sense.",
    "Depression keeps getting worse and worse. Hey guys, Im new to this sub and Im seeking advice as well as motivation to keep pushing forward in life. Im about to turn 20 and I need help. Everything had been stuck for months and I cant move forward no matter how hard I try, I just get pushed down again. I take medication for it but nothing has worked long term. Im starting to eat healthy and Im trying to exercise more often but even getting the motivation for that is extremely challenging.

I cant hold a steady job, I can barely maintain a decent mood for more than an hour or even a half hour at a time.

I would now like to proceed to seeking professional mental health help. Im aware of the harmful long term effects of medications and would only see a psychiatrist as a last resort.

Of course, Im aware that sometimes these things are not as simple as I think and everyone is different.

Is there a particular time frame that we give the therapist and judge their services by that? Thanks.",
    "Feeling at the end of the line When we got together we swore to work hard so we can give our selfs and our families a better life than the one we knew. As I mentioned I have anger issues and while I was working one day my boss called me to his office just to yell at me about a complain I presented to management about an issue with my laptop, I used to use my personal laptop to work in the office because they couldnt provide one for me and when it broke I asked them for a replacement, apparently this was out of line for them and he just begun insulting me with my colleagues hearing everything in the next room, I almost lost it but kept it together just enough to put myself face to face with him and asking him to repeat everything closing my fist ready to beat the shit out of him, he just stayed silent and I laughed at him and just turned away, a few weeks later I was fired if you think I should have reported him and the company I did but keep in mind this is Bolivia, there is no justice for anyone who doesnt have money so until today I havent been able to get another stable job and we basically just live with the food our families give us and small jobs I got and everything goes to pay the bills, on top of this, about a year and a half into our relationship when we moved in together and a month before getting fired we got a loan from the bank to began a business together and when she was set to go and make a deposit to buy our merchandise her uncle got notice of this and robbed her like a common thief yeah you read that right, so we went into debt with no job and no business, police and family where notified but the scumbag flew the country to Peru as far a we know.",
    "I’m lost Suicide thoughts First of all , I wanna say sorry for my bad English. I didnt go to psychiatrist , but Im pretty sure I have depression for 4 years . Back then I just felt like I lost all my positive emotions for no reason all of suden and I told it to friends and family and everybody was like  Its normal, it happens , it will disappeared... I cannot feel almost anything, when someone close to me die, I cant cry , when something good happens ,I cant smile sometimes but very rare I can feel euphoria  . I had no motivation and hope for better future then, and now is same . I have little health problems for 5 years ,and I cant even force my self to go to doctor because Im affraid of diagnosis, and things are worse now. People think Im doing a little bit better then earlier because I passed my entrance examination for college one month agolast year all my friends did it, I decided to make a one year break  . But college dont change anything. I m still big pesimits and cant feel anything. Actually I can feel fear. I have very strong social anxiety. I have 5 very close friends , they are like brothers to me and Im relaxed when Im with them , but when I talk to girls , Im totally confused. They even cant understand what Im saying because I dont open my mouth enough and speak very quiet ... I never had a girlfriend... Lets go back to social anxiety. Its very hard to go to for example market because Im overthinking what if someone asks me something, ... I have very good relationship with mother, not good but no bad relationship with sister , and very bad relationship with father its almost hate . I also have very often mood changings and I also take decisions very hard because I dont know what I want , and even when I take a decision, I change it very quick . I like watching soccer and basketball but its hard to concentrate to watching because my mind flyes somewhere... I cant find purpose of life. People dont understand how its hard when someone says  JUST FORCE YOURSELF AND GO TO DOCTOR , JUST GO OUT MAKE NEW FRIENDS ,... Sorry for long message .",
    "I can’t feel anything, no matter what I do, I can’t feel anything physically or mentally I am a 17 yo male, who comes from an extremely abusive household, and Ive recently noticed that my feelings are almost non existent. I also cant feel any pain, some might think its a gift but its a fucking curse. Im numb to the core and I just want to be normal again. I havent eaten in 3 days because if I try to I throw up. Ive been getting 4 hours of sleep regularly and cant physically sleep longer than that. My father used to beat me and force me to torture rodents with him. I remember one time he made me drown a possum in a garbage can and hack a squirrels limbs off. By the time I was 8 years old I had already known how to disassemble, clean, and reassemble a .38 caliber pistol. My father was a narcissist, and I was his golden child. If I ever did anything wrong I was told I was making our family look bad. Id get a hell of a beating if I even said anything out of line, and my mother was constantly in and out of hospitals from her accidents. I believe my father is a large part of why I am feeling the way I am recently. I noticed I stopped feeling emotion when I had a stroke last March. I wasnt scared, or worried, I was calm, and didnt even feel anything. Even after I had almost lost my ability to play guitar, I wasnt sad or scared. Ever since then, its just gotten worse and worse. My girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me and all I had to say to her was ok. Honestly it was probably best for her, I dont know if I can feel love anymore, so whats the point of trying. I recently noticed I cant physically feel pain when I was trying to fix the shingles on my roof. I missed with the hammer and smacked my hand right on the thumb, but I didnt feel anything. Just to test my theory, I smacked the back of my hand full force. I heard the crunching of bone, but still felt no pain. I dont know whats wrong with me.",
    "I feel depressed but feel like even more of a loser for feeling depressed. This might not resonate at all with some people. Its always been hard to explain. Ive never actually told anyone in this level of detail before. I have this overwhelming notion that im a loser. It always in the back of my mind but often times itll just overcome me a little bit. I struggle pretty occasionally with depression. Had about a year and a half in high school where it was really bad, never told anyone. Off and on in college, never told anyone. Overall I know a lot of people struggle with depression and many very likely have it much worse than me. Given that, I always felt the need to suck it up and control my attitude. Sometimes i think i do a pretty good job of it honestly. Pushing on and such. Ive always been able to put on a face paired with the fact that ive never given off the presentation of someone who is struggling deep down. Ill get to one thing that I think complicates things at least for me. I come from a really rich family. Pretty much a carbon copy of the daddys money type although one of the very few personal attributes ive been able to take pride in is my personality doesnt reflect it. I would say the fact that im an only child makes it even more surprising. As ive gotten older ive gotten much more grateful for how my parents have raised me in that sense. I graduated from college last May with a business degree that my parents paid for, of course. I have a stable job and i have a really great group of friends, most of which are elsewhere now for their jobsschool. Ive never really accomplished anything in life. Ive always felt like kind of a loser since high school. I was an average student. Pretty bad at sports even though I dedicated a pretty huge part of life to them at one point. I went to college far away. I graduated and went home and couldnt find a job in my field at all. I have a stable job now, albeit not something i wanted to do nor do i enjoy.",
    "Requesting advice on how to (better) handle a depressive episode For me, some times its triggered by something like a bad day at work or even just out of nowhere. It always winds up the same way. I lose focus on whatever Im doing, procrastinate, eat whatever junk food I have onhand, then I wind up talking and screaming at myself as my mind feels like it turned against me. I feel better at the end of it but surely there have to be better ways of handling when these episodes strike? Comfort food and distractions like video games and watching youtube and twitch arent really cutting it anymore. All advice is appreciated. Thank you in advance.",
    "Meds help - Sertraline Please help lol. TLDR at the bottom. I started taking Citalopram 5 years ago and tried to ween myself off them. When I did that, after I stopped taking them any little thing would make me angry or burst into tears. I was surprised at how much the meds actually effected me. So I asked doctor if I can change my meds entirely and went onto Sertraline, 50mg. I recently decided I dont want to be on these meds forever, and asked my Dr how do I stop them? He was no help whatsoever and said just half them etc and take it ever other day etc. I did that and now Im off them. But Ive noticed my moods changed. Any little thing that doesnt go right, I get really angry and I could burst into tears. Seriously all the time. Has anyone come off these and experienced what Im going through? Does it stop? Do you start to feel normal again? TLDR  Weened myself off Sertraline, little things that go wrong make me angry and cry. Does this stop? Will I feel normal again? When?",

    "I'm not clincally depressed (hasn't be confirmed) but.. I honestly feel like I should die and Im a mistake, before you suggest it, I told my mom. She tried to be supportive but I feel no better, its gone on for long. Since I was 57. Im honestly sick of faking being happy, I dont know what more to do. Why I wouldnt kill myself Im afraid of death, and even if I wasnt, theres nothing I could use. Im probably too young anyways, thats probably why my mom shrugged it off. Why I want to kill myself First off, I have trouble getting to sleep, I hardly wake up in the night, its just hard for me to get asleep. My mom has taken notice of that too. Over tired she calls it. Also, Im super lonely, I have no friends, the only place I have friends is on the internet, but theyre not on much, and when they are, IM the one giving support. I get they have problems too, but I gave up so long ago. Im also so scared of so many things. Falling into the sky, on a wallthe ceiling, that is a big problem for me when I look up in the sky or look up when Im lying down. It just scares me, it doesnt affect my sleeping, but other ascepts. Failure. Nobody likes failure right? Its worse for me. Im scared of failure because I feel if I fail then nobody would like me, they would ignore me more, I would be more alone. I know its not true, I just cant escape that fear. Sorry if this is too long, Ive just been holding this in so long.",

    "Looking for success stories from adults who have been depressed most of their lives Hey. So, Im 26 years old and really struggling at this moment. Ive struggled since I was probably 4 or 5 at the latest, maybe even earlier than that, due to extreme isolationneglect. I first tried to kill myself when I was about 5 or 6 years old. Ive lived a very lonely life riddled with abuse, poverty, extreme trauma, and negligence. Theres not many bright spots. I have PTSD, depressionanxiety, likely ADHD and who knows what else. I recently stopped medicating with marijuana, which I used for over 10 years. Its brought up a lot of these shitty past feelings and reminded me why I needed to escape. Ive been in therapy with several handfuls of different therapists, tried several medications, and I do all of the usual shit like yoga, daily exercise, good sleepdiet etc. but Im still completely miserable no matter how much I try to put a positive spin on things. Ive given myself until Im 30 years old to feel some sense of normalcy or contentment, or else I am going to end my life, because I cant continue on like this. I feel like that should be more than enough time to see if I have a shot at a decent life or not. Has anyone else been this deep in the hole, and managed to get themselves out for more than just short periods at a time? I know life is full of ups and downs, but Im tired of suffering 360365 days out of the year this might even be being generous. Im really hoping someone out there has a similar background and has made a better life for themselves. Id love to hear about it, in face I kind of need it right now. In case it helps you help me to know this, I feel that I still suffer a lot from loneliness I cant own pets due to rent restrictions and I have trouble making friends despite constant efforts, and I have a lot of anxietypessimism around the state of the world, mostly environmentaleconomical. I think these are the big things holding me back, but theres probably more. Cheers, looking forward to hearing some hopefully positive stories.",

Doesnt matter, I just cant take this to myself anymore. ampx200B Some of the things I will describe might disturb some people. I dont even know if Im allowed to post this. But here it goes ampx200B Im a male, 18 years old going to 19 next month and I have been diagnosed with depression for the last three years. At first, I didnt know really what was the reason for my depression thats why I always recommend people who dont have a actual reason to be depressed to go to therapy and take a deep look into your life. You might find something that was really hidden in your subconsciousness. ampx200B Well, thats what I did. ampx200B I am going to tell the story of my life. For some reason, writing it helps me to process my thoughts. And yes, I want people to read it because Im just terrible expressing myself in real life, and I just want people to know, but I dont have the courage to tell it in person. ampx200B Okay. So I was born in Brazil one of the reasons that Im writing in English its because Im the only one in the family who speaks a little bit of English. So Im sorry if theres some bad English here. The city that I was born is really violent, which is the reason why my mother wasnt very pleased with the idea of me going to play with other kids in the neighborhood. My father, worked his ass off during the week, but was an alcoholic, and once even tried to kill my mother. Nowadays, hes fine and theyre still together. But those days were tough.

    "Advice on intrusive thoughts? Hi! Im 19F and have been going through a depressive episode since late Decemberearly January. Its the first time Ive had this, or at least to this extent. Im on 50mg sertraline, but have begun to decline again more recently, so am making a doctors appointment about the possibility of increasing my dose. My parents are both mental health professionals so Im pretty lucky there, able to get advice on how to verbalise feelings, and what they think I would benefit from. Anyway, the reason Im writing is because Im suffering pretty badly with what I can only describe as intrusive thoughts. For me, theyre all memories of times Ive hurt someone or done something negative. A lot of them are extremely minor or where nobody was hurt, but I do so much mental gymnastics to the point that they seem life destroying. They almost feel like flashbacks, and I get more intense panic than I had while the events were actually happening. Theyll come if Im doing uni work, watching TV, in the shower, just woken up.. it doesnt matter. So my questions are has anyone experienced this sort of thing? If so, how do you deal with it? Ive been recommended EMDR and given details of a good therapist who could do this. Is this recommendation echoed by anyone with personal experience? Thanks ahead of time, and let me know if any more info is required! !",

I find that whenever I try to speak in group conversations I get talked over. Or I talk into the air with no one listening. I was going to lunch with two people who I consider to be friends, when they agreed they have no idea what I do outside of work and could only say a couple superficial things about me. We go out for drinks, food, etc on a regular basis. . . I live as an expat so your coworkers are everything they act as your family and friends all in one. ampx200B Ive been depressed pretty much right after I came here and havent felt like myself. I used to be the funny, witty person that was complimented for my confidence. Here, I am quiet, awkward, and passive. It has become a spiral where I try to speak up to be more involved, but then no one responds, so I become more insecure and talk less. ampx200B I still have half a year left before my contract ends and I can leave, so any helpful advice about how I can improve my situation would be appreciated. ampx200B",
    "Help Please - Parents Sent Brother to Pacific Quest Hi all, My brother whose currently 10th grade has been struggling with depression and anxiety for a while, but my parentsI found out about it last year when he consumed an excess of benadryl in hopes to finally be able to get good sleep. From that time, hes started failing classes and has begun heavy marijuanaalcohol use even being hospitalized for the latter once. For what its worth, he routinely started talking about how his anxiety started getting better because he didnt care about school anymore and because he started smoking. My parents are doing all that they can and know how to do to help him out. I just got back from college on spring break, and they broke the news to me about why my brother wasnt here when I got backhe had just flown out to Pacific Quest PQ this morning. For more info Pacific Quest website is httpspacificquest.orghttpspacificquest.org What one subreddit has to say about PQ httpswww.reddit.comrtroubledteenscomments4rgsa7pacific_quest_experience_from_a_survivorhttpswww.reddit.comrtroubledteenscomments4rgsa7pacific_quest_experience_from_a_survivor  My parents have been consulting multiple doctorspsychiatristsschool adminidk who else, and they apparently heard about PQ as a highly recommended program. My mom showed me a video, and it seemed suspiciously sugarcoatedidealistic, so I went on a reddit search to find out more. God damn. I thought it was just one post bashing PQ, but it seems that theres nearly nothing positive to say about it, other than the fact that it, relative to other similar programs, has a better quality of life and that seems like its not saying a lot at all. What do I do in terms of my parents, brother, and PQ? I really am terrified for my brothers well beingfrom reading, it seems that PQ is nothing but regressive for health. Should he stay? Come home asap? Is coming home soon feasible? More in general as well what can I do to help my brother out? Thank you.",

    "i had to say goodbye to my sweet boy today after finding out yesterday cancer is ravaging his body. ive never wanted to simply wait in a waiting room longer, but they called us right back. i prayed that the doctor was tied up and would take a while before she got back there, but no sooner did i finish thinking that she came in. i felt myself detach from my body at that point. i cant remember anything she said, but i know from the time she came in the room to the time she left the room was only about five minutes. my babys body was so tired, it had been fighting so hard for so long. he was gone before the injection to stop his heart was even finished. my world and heart suddenly felt so... empty. i was wailing in the vets office, the pain is so deep. the doctor told me our grief is only a reflection of our love, and i believe that 100. i genuinely dont think i could love my boy even an OUNCE more because my little heart would give out. im back home now, my other dogs dont understand why their brother isnt here. i never ever expected my maximus to be the first to go. i have two other senior dogs, and maximus is the youngest. i felt so sure i had at least 34 more years with him, and i feel so robbed. i wasnt remotely prepared, i had zero clue this was coming. the one comfort i have is i dont feel remorse over the amount of time i spent with him. i dont feel like i wish i wouldve sat with him and pet him more because that dog was at my side constantly. any spare second i have im laying with him. anywhere i go, hes the one that gets up in the car and rides with me. he loves a car ride. i always surprise him with a mcdouble, and the excitement he shows never ever ever gets old. im not prepared for all of that to be a fond memory. im scared, because i know in time ill forget how it felt to pet that big block head and i dont ever want to.",

I cant tell anyone about it besides my friend himself, nobody thinks here that online relationship can be real, if its either just friendship or a spark of love. Its too dangerous and too much risk involved. Cant disagree, but I dont think its true in our case. Even though its been a year, were exchanging pictures and we made phone calls and the risk still exists, but its limited, but they dont even want to think about it.

    "Living in Israel, as of today. It needs ti be called a civil war non the less. Back to me.. Ive stopped relaxing, and listening to the news 247. We have an app for sirens so you wont miss it. While the news are broadcasting 247  we have alerts on screen for every city, and you wait to see if neighboring cities appear and youll be next. Im no longer using noise cancellation in my AirPods Pro so i wont miss the sirens while i work. Keeping the windows open while we sleep. And then I start to understand what PTSD is. A car starts its engine, an ambulance, a police car, firefighters, a child starts to cry, a motorcycle drive through my streets, everything to me is starting to sound like a siren, and Im always ready to run for safety. My parents, my partner, my friends  all have that. Sometimes there are recorded sirens in the news and we mute it for a second to hear if its in our city or not. Now for the depression. I fear to travel outside my city. From both people and missiles. I fear for the future of the people in my country. Ive canceled lots of plans. Today was the first day I moved the live news broadcasting to my iPad, and powered up my xbox to clear my mind. It lasted one hour.. I dont know what to do while everything is going on other than listening to the news, stay safe, and buy foods for weeks so i wont get out of my house.

    "I need help I am in high school and I have clinical depression. I have decided to seek help on this subreddit. The cause of my depression is not something a psychiatrist or a psychologist can fix. There is something I want in life and without it, I can not live. Without it, I feel like I have no purpose. It is not an object nor a person. It is something that would allow me to change this world and I mean in a huge, impactful way. I can not get it however because it is not decreed for me. I do not want to do something else as this is what I want to work for in my life. Anything less is not worth the struggle to fight for. Without it, I am just another regular person who walks the Earth and doesnt do anything for impact.

    "A cry for help I live with abusive parents. Im 18, but unable to move out because the Covid situation is really bad in my country. Honestly all my hopes of staying alive were latched on to the fact that Id be able to move out by the end of 2020. But things have been so bad, quarantine has given my parents the right to basically keep me under lock and key under the farce of protecting me. Theyve broken the locks to the door of my room, and often my father is physically abusive. Both my parents are emotionally abusive. Every time my father is done beating me up, for months nobody in my family talks to me. Ive suffered from a complete mental breakdown, for a period of time I believed I was dead. I called a child helpline but I chickened out when they said theyd come over to my house to help me out. I talked to my school counsellor and she made me apologise to my parents for disrespecting them enough to call a helpline against them. I genuinely cannot do this anymore. I havent slept at night for weeks on end. Every time I try to sleep, I wake up suddenly and am unable to sleep again. I wrote down a suicide note yesterday. I made a reddit account today because Ive the tiniest bit of hope left. Ive studied so hard all my life just so Id take a Student Loan and move out for a good college, but all of that has fallen through. All my life, one hope sustained me, but now thats gone, Im basically living as a prisoner. I wish even a single person would believe me. It might save my life. Please.

    "Heavy Shame From Drunken Past Starting around 2015, I tried to fix my depression with alcohol. Stupid, I know. Im sober and I think quite a lovely person now, but I cant stop remembering back then, and feeling this all consuming shame that makes me want to die. First instance, I was nervous aboutat a social gathering. I drank too much and dont remember everything, but I think I spoke to a poor, nice guy about Shakespeare and my dream of being a writer and god knows what for ages, and then I was just obnoxious. Not my shy self anymore. Talked loud. Tried to high five somebody who left me hanging because, well, you couldnt blame them. Just awful cringy. I did a semi burp, I think, which alerted my friends, who got me into the bathroom, and then I remember being half asleep in a chair, with that lovely guy trying to reassure me that I would be getting home soon. My mum eventually came and got me. I threw up in a bin outside, and was spouting Yeats poetry whilst stumbling with my mum and my friend holding me up. I cant stop remembering, and feeling this suicidal, heavy shame. Then, 2017, I met my boyfriend. Gorgeous human being. For maybe three out of the four years weve been together, Ive been a sporadic drunk. Drinking at home. Getting drunk. Crying my eyes out. Or angrily breaking up with him, selfsabotaging. Hes had to take the locks off all the doors so I dont do something stupid and he cant get in. One night, I even blanked out. I dont drink like that anymore, but I cannot stop thinking about how horrible it wouldve all been for him. I was so needy, horrible, greedy, drunk, and delusional. And no matter how much I apologise and try to make up for it, I still feel rotten. He keeps telling me to forget about it, not linger in that place, and that hes forgiven me, but how can he?",
    "How do I help my girlfriend My girlfriend 27 has slowly been sinking into depression, and I have no clue as to how I can help her. These last few months have been tough on her especially the last two. Her parents have started talking about divorce and its beginning to get ugly between them. Her mother calls her and vents about it and it usually leaves her angry. Her brother who has recently moved out of their parents house in January was just put in a psych ward for evaluation because his schizophrenia and paranoia have gotten the better of him since hes moved out. This is his second time being admitted. My girlfriend had a tremendous amount of pressure put on her for the last couple months from her parents to watch over him since they live out of town. Since hes been admitted her depression has crept up on her. Shes doesnt want to do anything but sleep and cry. Im always there by her side but do give her space for her self so that Im not overbearing on her. Lately shes been going on about how she wishes she could just end it all and kill herself because all her pain would go away and it would be easier. This isnt the first time shes said something along these lines. Shes never tried to hurt herself in that sort of way, but it does concern me. Shes been visiting a therapist lately and it seems to help her a bit but its only been her 3rd session, and she hasnt completely opened up on the subject with her. This morning she texted me that I havent been giving her the attention she needsdespite being with her and doing everything for her when I come home from work. Im trying really hard to help lift t her spirits and nothing picks her up. Even the dates we try to have do help. Half way through she wants to call it a night so she can go home to sleep and lay down. Im not sure what to do anymore.

    "I’m lost, stuck and desperate Im at a point in my life where I am extremely depressed and have strongly considered suicide. I always feel weak and tired, with no motivation or willpower to do the simplest of tasks. I feel like any motivation I have to better myself is weaker than my will to end my life. I live in a moderately poor house we have the money to put food on the table and pay bills, but the slightest slip and were homeless, Im 20 and dependent on my parents, my dad who is also depressed and unhappy with his job, my mom is chronically ill and bedridden for the most part. I love my parents to death, but I could never let myself ask them for help, Im already a burden enough as it is, and I couldnt live with myself if they felt any guilt for the way I feel and not being able to afford help for me. I tried to have a simple retail job that I thought I could handle so Id be able to support myself, but I had to quit on my first full day because I was too weak to physically stand the whole work day, and couldnt be of much use. It was the most embarrassing and shameful day in my life and that incident sent me even further into depression. The only reasons I havent killed myself yet is because I love my mom, and because I still have hope that someone out there will someday choose to love me, and the prospect of raising a family with that woman is the only hope I havent lost. But the more and more time progresses, even that hope is starting to dwindle. I feel like my cowardice is whats really getting in the way of my killing myself, but I dont know how long it will keep me back. What can I do?",

    "Should I get myself checked in to a psychiatric ward so they can force me to start my antidepressant? I have anti nausea medication, and I can take that while starting. This option has upsides and downsides too. First of all if I ask them for anti anxiety medication Im guaranteed to be seen as a drug seeking patient. They did that before and I dont even have any drug abuse history. Even if I get them I might not have the willpower to start them. I might end up getting an anxiety attack even if I take anti anxiety medication. Okay here is the part where Im talking about stuff I dont really know much about. The anti nausea medication I have is Zofran. From what I understand the reason antidepressants cause nausea is because they increase the levels of serotonin in the brain and the digestive system. As a result of that the increased levels of serotonin agonizes the 5HT3 receptors and this causes nauseavomiting. With repeated use the 5HT3 receptors become downregulateddesensitized and because of that nauseavomiting stops. Now if I were to take Zofran it will prevent me from getting nauseous because it will prevent serotonin from agonizing the 5HT3 receptors, since its a 5HT3 antagonist. But that means it will also prevent 5HT3 receptors from downregulateddesensitized, because they arent being excessively agonized, and when I stop taking Zofran I will become nauseous or I will vomit, and that defeats the whole purpose of taking Zofran. I dont want to take Zofran continuously because it comes with its own side effects. End of the part where Im talking about stuff that I shouldnt be talking about. So now the upsides of the second option. I wont have to deal with the psych ward. Considering the healthcare system in my country, I have good reasons to believe that the care they provide at the ward is not good enough. I wont have to do a lot of explaining to my parents. I wont have to risk abuse and stuff like that. The revolving door syndrome appears to be very prevalent with the mental health facilities in my country.",

Been adding protein and healthier food options, and attempting to add more daily calories to my diet as to help me look less skinny and more healthier and fit.

We have talked about this a few times, but sometimes Im afraid Ill never feel things again and itll get impossible for us to handle and I really dont wanna be a burden for him. What do I do???? ?",
    "How to trust agian I 28f have been married to my husbands 38 for 10 years. We have 4 children together. My husband took a job out of town about 6 months ago. I woke up to a text one morning say he had said something side ways to someone wife and to ignore her husband is is going to make it dramatic. So I check my email and there it is! Her husband sent me screen shot of the conversation between them. He begged me to stay with him. I was and still am devastated. I dont know how to trust him. I dont know what to believe anymore. I feel worthless and lost. How do I move on?",
    "Meds helped for a short period of time, but now I have no energy again, and can't do things. Any advice? Long story short I was diagnosed a few months ago, but was in denial because I wasnt actually sad about life, suicidal, etc. I started taking SSRIs LexaproEscitalopram and got a taste of what things could be like. For once, I had all the energy I needed. I didnt spend forever in bed or on the couch deliberating when I wanted to do something, took five minutes to just pull myself up. I no longer felt like I was fighting the weight of my entire body to do simple tasks. After 2 weeks I decided to drink, and thats when it went downhill. For 9 days, I was without energy, spent hours on the couch watching TV each day, not getting up to do much besides work. I doubled my dose, then for a few days it got better. Energy was back, I was doing things, etc. But then it went back to normal. To be clear, Im still not depressed in the classical sense of having negativity about life. I have hope for the future, overall Im pretty happy with where I am. However, I miss having the energy I had. I miss being able to actually work towards my goals and not feel exhausted by basic chores. My mind would go on autopilot, and I didnt have to constantly make decisions to preserve energy. Any suggestions on what I should do next? Ive been on Lexapro for 4 weeks, with a small gap last week where I didnt take it for 2 days straight. Im not sure whether I should seek other meds, keep on my current ones, or even look for other factors when it comes to regaining my energy. Im goign to book a doctors appointment and discuss options, but I wanted to know if anyone else had similar issues, and what theyve done.",

That being said I still havent figured out what I want to do with my life and feel like I have been living on autopilot for most of the recent years. I feel like I have been going through some form of depression since I was a teenager, nothing major but I certainly feel a lack of motivation, a dissatisfaction with myself, apathy, cynicism and anxiety. Whenever I try to think about what I want to do with my life I just get a blank. Whenever I feel sad and try to think what would make me happy I also get a blank Lately I have been so dissatisfied with everything that I started asking myself, what world would I want to live in? where would I be happy? Unfortunately, I cant think of anything. Maybe Im asking the wrong questions but why cant I imagine myself in a happy place?",
    "What can I do to stop being a weirdo? But at the same time if I stay calm, I feel like Im boring the person and then I panic and then I start acting like a weirdo its a never ending cycle Im constantly daydreaming because I hate my current situation and weirdly enough when I imagine talking to someone my lips move and it seems like Im talking to myself which is super embarrassing. Daydreaming takes my mind off of everything, but its super depressing when I stop and I come back to reality Im a lot better now and I dont daydream as much I constantly feel like Im under so much pressure Im not feminine in any way. I dont care of my appearance and I smell but I just dont feel like taking care of myself, I know its a crappy excuse. I feel so masculine and I hate it. I love being a girl, but I dont know why I cant bring myself to act like one. I sit like a man too. As weird as it sounds, I feel like Im watching myself play a character. Almost as if Im not allowing myself to be my true self because I think Im boring. I dont know why I cant allow myself to slow down. Im always rushing myself and I have to do everything at an unusually fast pace. Im so erratic with everything, whether it be me talking to someone or walking. I dont know what to do about this. I dont know if its because my family have always called me insane and as an act of rebellion, maybe Im acting like that because I believe it too. I dont think Im insane but, maybe Im wrong?

    "All I want - is my death Good day, everyone. This is not my first post on reddit regarding my problem. Long story  short I had a girlfriend. We have been friends for 7 years. She was my best friend. We supported each other in everything and always helped each other. But, as often happens, I fell in love with her. And I ended up in the friend zone, of course. For the last 5 years I have been with her in the friend zone. Although at one point it became clear that I could get out of her if I was more persistent  she herself told me about it. But things went downhill this year. She found a boyfriend and spent all her free time with him. I, in turn, turned into a bunch of depression and occasional jealousy. And in the end, a month ago, she said that we both understand that this cannot continue. That we need to end our communication, and I will only feel better if she disappears from my life. Today I tried to write to her and make up, to offer her just friendship, communication on the network and nothing more, because I need her very much. But she refused me. And she did it with such contempt, with such hatred. She said that she did not need this communication, that over the past month she understood. that she hasnt needed it for a long time. So in the end, she doesnt even need me as a friend. I really thought that everything would work out, and we would be at least friends again. But I was wrong. She doesnt need me, in any form. Now it is difficult for me to think and do anything at all. I practically cannot go outside, because almost immediately I feel anxiety and, often, I start having panic attacks even if I just go out into the garden next to my house. Because I immediately start thinking that she is out there somewhere, with her new boyfriend. I cant read, watch movies, I cant play games, because my thoughts are occupied with something completely different. I need to write my dissertation, and I cannot concentrate, because my thoughts are not at all about studying.",
    "I feel like a terrible person Okay so recently my mom went on Facebook and said she was going to kill herself, she then went one and blamed two of my sisters and I. People at my school saw it and now everyone knows Im the reason my mom wants to die. Thats not why Im mad however, Im mad because I have a 10 year old little sister that she was just going to leave, and even though I dont talk to my mom everyday Im still hurt that she was just going to leave me. I feel so guilty that Im mad at her because I also struggle with mental health and Ive been there before, and Ive felt what she feels but Im still SO angry at her. Shes never been the best mom, shes hurt me in the past so many times and this whole thing makes me want to cut her off for good, and even though shes hurt me so many times I know me wanting to just leave will hurt her, so Im trapped.

    "I feel like killing myself would be the best option for most people in my life Dead end job, schooling that almost only stresses me out, relationships falling apart, and nearconstant suicidal thoughts have been making me feel like most people would be better off without me. All I am is a waste of space, time, resources, and thought and although things may be temporarily shitty for some people if I were to kill myself, I think itd be overall worth it and beneficial for others in the end. Every day feels boring, yet I constantly feel like I do it to myself. I lost enjoyment in most things months or years ago and am just exhausted of forcing myself to be positive to others and trying to not let my misery show. Right now, there are only three things are really keeping me from doing it I dont want others to feel like they could have done something which is an almost inevitable outcome, I dont want my younger siblings to not have an older brother to look up to, and I have an ever decreasing hope of things getting better. I guess I just dont see the point in keeping myself around, everyday is dreadful and more often than not, miserable. I dont have anything to look forward to, and the monotony and boringness of life is getting to me. I guess Im asking for some advice or help but I dont even know",

I think of every consequence of my actions. Like where I keep dishes in kitchen. Opening and closing door. Even when I am walking down the road. Striking a lighter to light my joint. everything small you can imagine. This makes me mad and too conscious. I keep thinking of my childhood scenes where I lived with my parents and always wondering how time has passed. I was a kid back then and now I am an adult. I am so obsessed with age of people. How old is he or she? That actor? That sports person? and then I compare what I was doing when I was 16, 18, 23 etc. I am 26 right now. I dont check my actions usually but when I check them, they are bad. I am using same pair of clothes for months. Using same toothbrush for years. I have rarely gave any gifts to any one. I am not so close with my parents. I am single child. I lived in rented place for 11 years before leaving for another city for college. My parents finally have their own house now. We live with parents in India till death. I used to steal erasers, scales etc. from school. Even from my parents too. I have been caught sometimes. I now realized that maybe I was less satisfied with myself. I always felt less because all my relatives and friends had there own houses and car. My parents had one twowheeler and my parents used to fight with each other which used to make me very sad. When I used to watch other parents living happily, I used to think why I dont have that, why my parents are always fighting? This less feeling I still have with me. I still feel less. I am lazy for sure. Now I am sitting idle from last 1 year. No job, no friends, no personal connection with any human being. I never tell my secrets to anyone.",

I started kind of taking care of my depression a few months ago, but I still experience really bad days suicidal thoughts and such.

This means I would allow myself to put my job research on hold while really taking measures to work on my depression for the first time in my life. The problem Im facing now during job interviews is the dreaded question But what have you been doing for the past 5 months? I see no job experience, no nothing. with the nice tone of voice Have you been doing fuck all? I was thus wondering, what would a good answer be to that sort of question?

I keep falling into this terrible spiral of thoughts like well, you would feel less depressed if only youd exercise, eat healthy and keep the house clean, but of course, living with depression means I rarely have the energy to do all or any of those things. And the more I kick myself, the more energy I lose, so I sit in bed, eat cookies and let messes pile up around me, which in turn makes me more depressed, and so on.... Im on medication and in therapy, both of which help, but I get so down on myself for not being able to form better habits. I know I need to start small and to go easy on myself, but even then its a struggle. At the moment Im more focused on how to deal with the guilt of not doing things, as opposed to strategies for accomplishing said things.

I immediately went and bought some mens deodorant since it tends to be stronger, but I was hoping someone might have a better way for me to combat this.

    "We were engaged. He left me for a 19 year old he has been talking to online for the past 3 months When he woke up, he sent me a long message apologizing, saying how bad he felt and begged for my forgiveness. Yes I know, Im stupid, but I was going to forgive him. He was telling me that anything I wanted him to do to gain my trust back, to let him know. I told him to block her in all social medias. He did. He sent me screenshots of everything. The long call happened from a Friday night through a Saturday morning. His regret and attempt to try gaining my trust back only lasted until Sunday. These two days he spent apologizing and telling me how he wanted to grow old with me, that kind of stuff. Well, like all this didnt seem bad enough, the worst part of the story comes now. On Monday morning, I was at the gym, and I got a message from him. The way he wrote seemed odd, so I asked if something was wrong and he said he didnt feel good. I immediately left the gym and told him to give me a few minutes, that I would get home and we could call. As soon as I got home, I didnt even shower or anything, I just went to my room and called him. Then he just finished shattering my heart. He said he needed to be honest with me. He said that from the very first time we met in person, when I went there, he felt something wasnt right between us. That he didnt feel a connection. He said kissing and other intimate moments felt weird. He said he only proceeded with everything, asked me to marry him, started my Visa process and everything because he was scared of being alone. Since he never had another relationship before and I was the first one that ever got interested in him, he felt like he had to do everything he could to keep me in his life, so he wouldnt end up alone.

I know I didnt have an awesome childhood, neither of my parents were people I could look up to. No role models. Im just so bad at life.

I dont use suicide hotlines or access amp crisis phone lines or text lines anymore all those things that my former therapists recommend because of how many times Ive felt worse afterwards or been hung up on dealing with someone whos already numbed and burned out themselves. I get it, the mental healthcare system is understaffed and underfunded and the therapists Ive had, its just been so disappointing and regressive to my health.

    "I don't have anything, no future and just.. yeah. To this day, I cant ever get any medication for it either, but I save that little later. ampx200B By 12th grade, my grandfather had passed away, and he was the only thing I had to father like. My depression hits me harder and I just no longer had any desire for school. I begin skipping so much school that I was dropped from the program. I only stayed home, watch t.v and played video games. I get a job and I stayed there for five years. Naturally I find other work over time and keep going with jobs I hate. I move in with my mother at some point, I thought it be a good idea and grow closer to her. ampx200B My mother goes on to lie and steal from me the entire time Im with her. I had even tried to go back to school and get my GED but told down a lot. I pay money for something, and they would pocket it. I would sleep, and they steal my credit card and spend my entire paychecks. I was often treated like a third class citizen while living with them. ampx200B While attending GED school, it a massive struggle for me. I cant focus longer than 30 minutes and only a few times a week if that. I still have no medication to get back on or a way to get them. To this day, Im quite afraid to ever try for it, in thinking Im making it up, you last this long why now you need them. So yeah, I dont ever get it and it alwaysjust something I hate myself for. I just feel like Im lazy and crap because I cant focus on. I did end up getting half of the credits credit for GED, where I am at you dont have to take all the test at once. You can take each test one at a time. Im only needing math and science which both I have a tough time focusing on. Both take the longest to learn and hardest for me to stay still for. ampx200B At some point, I grow homeless and then move into with a relative and then kicked out after getting a bunch of money from me.",
    "Has anyone tried online or phone therapy? Any recommendations? Over the winter, I had been looking for a therapist in my city. After reaching out to several therapist with no replies, I just figured I didnt sound like a good candidate to them and I kind of got lazy and put it off.

    "I Need Help sorry for my bad English  This year my life turned upside down when my parents broke up. In my family everyone dislikes me without telling me . I am like their own personal helper. Also everyone in the house is against me , for example when me and my brother fight everyone will help my brother , when i and my mom fight everyone supports my mom because she is always superior from me and the best thing is that sometimes when my older brother fights with my mom they bring me into the topic and start saying things like  he always studies and he will never achieve his dreams  or something like that. And the best part is that i cannot get help , i dont want to speak to my mother and solve the problem , i keep everything inside me. One time i was brought to a hospital to speak to a psychiatrist  the guy that helps you when you have a phonological problem  and i started crying because i learned that when thing get tough start crying. I dont know what to do and i am so shy and antisocial that i cannot even ask a teacher for help. Reddit you are my only hope.",
    "Someone gave me this \"advice\"? Basically I just wanted to ask if this was reasonable advice. This person knows Im extremely suicidal and depressed and have a bunch of mental problems. They also know that Ive been the only one to advocate for myself for years for treatment. I am receiving treatment, and my therapist even says Ive been trying very hard. This persons advice to me was just, Just try harder. You can always try harder. And they refused to understand that sometimes you just cant try any harder, you reach your limit, or even that you might need the help of someone else to help get you through. They said that needing anyone elses help is toxic and unhealthy and thats using someone as crutch, you will never get better, etc. Just completely disregarding everything I am feeling and going through. Am I wrong to feel upset by this? I feel like its a bs answer to shrug off any responsibility as an important person in my life.",
    "Thank you for reading. Hey, I dont know if anyone is going to read this or not, but if you do, thank you. I havent been on a date in two years, been intimate with someone in 3, I know that doesnt matter and it doesnt matter to me that much. But it feels nice to be attracted to in some way. Every single girl in the past two years has ghosted me. Every. Single. One. I tried paying for tinder, paying for match, paying for bumble, and clover. Tinder is kind of a joke but Im just saying I tried them all. I went out and tried to meet people in bars, games, events. Ive had a woman look me up and down and say ew and walk away after I tried to talk to her. I dont know, the biggest thing I want in life is a loving wife and beautiful children. And I may only be 22 but I want that long relationship where there is nothing but love, started at a young age. I dont want to be 50 finding my soulmate. But nowadays people see one thing they dont like about you and they just assume the relationship will never work. Ive lost several friends this year because of how things have changed. My friends also ended up trying to make plans without me and hide the fact they were hanging out, most of the time it was because they wanted to smoke, and I dont. And my work has me travel, often, and for at least a few weeks at a time several states away and I cant go out and spend time with friends or family, because I dont know anyone and there arent any coworkers nearby because they usually send me to areas where they have no one. And it just amplifies the depression and started to develop insomnia because of my depression and having a hard time trying to fall asleep in a hotel room.",
    "I got cheated on by my now ex-boyfriend of six years and I feel worthless He said he hadnt loved me for a while. That when he said he wanted to get married that it was just a lie. Through all this I couldnt get him to see that he had lied and cheated. We argued the rest of the way home. At the exit to his apartment I made a comment of how if he cared for the person he was talking to he wouldnt have been a liar. That triggered him. He went into a screaming rage in my face while I was driving on the highway. It was verbal abuse. I feared for my safety in that moment and so I pushed him back. That made him even more enraged and put our lives in danger by grabbing a hold of my steering wheel and attempting to swerve us off the road. I ended up dropping him off at his apartment a few minutes after that and asked for my things back. Since I still had the girl on Snapchat I watched as how he had already rebounded not even after dropping him off. And so now Im just here. Feeling worthless. I cared for him I loved him. But I didnt even recognize him anymore and all I ever wanted to do was help him feel better. He didnt even have a regard for me anymore. He didnt even have the guts to tell me straight forward that he was breaking up with me and masked it with the excuse of needing space. And so Ive been writing this since 523 AM and now its 629 AM. I dont know how to feel. But I feel worthless.",

    "I am sad, alone and scared. Ive never been properly diagnosed with depression but I am currently feeling very depressed. A few years ago when I was younger amp my parents were going through a divorce I was severely miserable, would have large bouts of anxiety amp often contemplated ending my life. It was a sad time in my life but I am glad to say that I got through it and have been doing great for the most part and have hardly felt anxious since. However recently I have been feeling really down amp depressed. All I want to do is sleep and I eat because I am sad and bored, and then I become sad because I eat too much. I have gained weight and am so insecure. I have been skipping my uni classes because I have no friends there and my degree is hard and it all makes me so sad. With all my friends heading in different directions I just feel so alone. I think my family have noticed and say things that are kind of cruel, but I know they mean well. They think I have obsessive compulsive tendencies because I tend to pick at my face often amp struggle to stop. I just dont want to let anyone down amp I am afraid to take the steps to become better because I know it will disappoint my family if I decide to leave uni for example. But most importantly Im scared of going back to how I was years ago, I never want to feel that way again. Ive never reached out for professional help either and dont have the money for therapy. Part of me would feel also ashamed in a way if I got professional help. I hate the idea that something may actually be wrong with me, and I hate the idea of having to take meds. I just feel so lost and conflicted. I feel like I know what I need to do but its so hard to do it and remain consistent. If anyone has any advice at all it would greatly appreciated.

    "Death Anxiety Hey all. Sorry if this seems unhinged. Im just gonna try to get it all out. In the last month and a half, Ive been having unwanted deep philosophical thoughts on how we perceive time, what the self is, and that we all die eventually. Ive been diagnosed with depression since I was 16 when I first had these thoughts hit me in a big way and Im 27 now. Zoloft has always helped, but Ive been bad about my meds for the last year or so so Im having a relapse, I get this. But the thing is, the stuff Im worrying about feels so real. These arent Im bad, or no one loves me, or I want to hurt other people thoughts. Theyre on a deeper, simpler level. Sometimes I wonder if Im being treated for depression when Im actually just seeing the truths of existence clearer than a lot of other people else and that makes me feel hopeless that Ill ever feel better. Like the system might not be equipped to help me. It makes me so sad. The problem with my worries is that theyre real worries. Im mainly concerned with why do anything at all if were just animals who die. I AM going to die. There probably ISNT a soul. I WILL eventually cease to exist. All the stuff I care about is just electricity and matter and chrmicals in the brain telling me I care about stuff. The I isnt even necessarily real, its just a collection of smaller parts. I know that the classic reddit atheist way of getting through this stuff is just saying life is what you make of it, but when really confronted by the seeming truth that the self will disappear when we die, I guess it just rings kind of hollow. Like, yes of course I love my girlfriend and our pets and my parents and my friends, and I love to make art and perform, I want to go to grad school and get married and have kids. And doing that stuff makes me feel great! But lately Ive just been under this cloud of none of this has purpose even if you pretend it does. Like, Ill feel great doing these things and then Ill think that was nice, but Im going to forget that it happened and cease to exist eventually.",

Seeking a therapist is probably the better option than venting out in this group. but being unemployed 32yo, and without savings, I guess sharing my situation is a more practical way of trying to get away from that urge to end things.

    "Too many losses..so much pain So many losses... Im tired. Hurting. And feel alone. The past 78 months have been hard. Ive experienced a lot of losses and they keep coming. First.. I ended a long term relationship in September. We lived in another state I left and returned to our home state. I left him, our home and my job. Eventually.. I lost my car and cat. All of that was hard. My ego hurt because he reconnected with a former ex shortly after I departed within weeks and they are still together. He still attempts to contact me and in moments of loneliness and weakness I have seen him, despite knowing about his relationship. When I returned to my home state I moved in with my sister. She just informed me that her lease is not being renewed and I have to move in two months. My anxiety is thru the roof as I dont know if Ill be able to get the money to move with such short notice. I am working, but its a seasonal position that ends in June. I am looking for permanent work. Lastly, a close friend died over the weekend. She had cancer was diagnosed in December. She had been a big support to me over the years. We talked daily when I lived out of state and every day since I returned. When she received her cancer diagnosis, I was a big help to her. I feel hurt, lonely and alone. My circle of friends has always been small and it continues to get smaller. Right now I feel like I dont have anyone. Id like to see a therapist, but most dont accept my insurance. Besides that will also expire in May. I also feel hopeless. Im in my 50s so starting all over again feels daunting.

    "Feeling at the end of the line A couple years later I met my first long relationship girlfriend and as you can imagine I fell hard for her and spoiled her like crazy, she helped my reconnect with my father and I told her about my trauma and to my surprise she also was a victim, we both tried to get professional help within our means but only I got serious about it and kept going to my sessions, she said she was fine on her own and knowing how hard this was I let her take her own choice and just tried to be supportive when needed, needless to say it ended bad, near the end when we were about to move in together I tried to start a conversation about how we began getting together and how special she was to me, apparently I was the only one that felt that way because she told me that the only reason she kissed me and begun hanging out with me was because she felt pity for me, we had other issues like a poor sexual life and not enough time on her part for us, so after she told me about how we really had begun our relationship I felt numbed and after a few days in emotional hell I broke up with her, I listed all that was wrong with the relationship and told her that something that begins with pity cant have a future, I wasnt able to tell her that that was what hurt me the must, she never apologized and we went our separate ways, her family loved me and knew I was the good guy and I was the best for her and tried to help but never went passed of a small conversation with me, they were harder on her but in the end they are her family, I found out she also cheated later on and it was what killed the last pieces of love I had for her, I didnt confront her about it and we never spoke ever again, the pity confession destroyed my self confidence we were together for close to 4 years. So after that and having gotten some more help with my trauma I went on the quest to become the best version of me and was doing ok, over a year later I meet my current wife, a person so beautiful that has made me feel what is real love and allowed me to love freely again, but another kind of problems fell onto us, financial problems.",

He says his efforts for the relationship clearly dont make me happy so trying harder is worse for him and me moving forward. Ive messed up because I really did complain I was unhappy with his efforts. we are taking a break now and Ive asked for space. he really wants to push me away for good this time since I was hurting because he couldnt try hard enough for us.

    "Just help I am an 18 year old male. Ive been suffering from anxiety my whole life and depression the last 45 years. Ive seen a therapist, been prescribed antidepressants, and been prescribed antimania drugs. None of these things have worked. Over the past year Ive stopped taking the meds antidepressants and antimania and seeing the therapist because none of it worked. Ive tried smoking weed to help. Ive tried taking cbd to help.

I cant help it, and I dont know why I do it however my mum always says to me dont be like that, stop it, you dont wanna look weird. But I cant fucking help it. I try to reach out for help but everything is so fucking tedious. No one fucking understands.

    "Help. Depressed husband. How to best support and love? Hi! I believe my husband is depressed but not completely admitting to it yet. We have been together 14 years and have children together. I love him dearly. His depression has manifested itself in pushing me away, anger and hostility towards me, I believe as a defense from trauma in his childhood that has been retriggered in the past few years. I am basically his scapegoat for everything wrong in his life. He also is distant, wont talk, and uses TV and books as an escape which are at thankfully healthy but spends considerable time in them. I would love ANY solid advice on how to navigate this. How can I best love him through this? Especially if his instinct right now is to push me away. Any dos or donts? Can I leave affirmations  encouragement for him in the form of notes? This is killing me slowly inside. I miss my friend. He is such a fantastic guy and I feel as if he has been swallowed by a dark cloud. Also to note we are in the beginnings of couples counseling. Thanks again for advice. Especially if you have been that husband and come out healed on the other side.",
    "I’m sorry for another dramatic rant lmao sorry if this is going to be annoying and stupid. you dont have to read this random rant ahah iF16 struggle with depression and anxiety in addition to some other mental disorders. i have the kindest friends in the whole universe. my parents pay for my therapist and my psychiatrist. i come from a quite privileged family. plus my school kindly allowed me to have an easier program than the rest of the school after i ended up at a mental hospital. however despite only studying 4 subjects i am failing all of them. most of the time i dont have energy to do anything, so i just watch Netflix. my homework keeps piling up and it gets more and more overwhelming. i become too anxious to face my teachers and my classmates, so i decide to stay at home. this leads to me feeling extremely guilty. i feel like a disappointment c i dont deserve any of the support and im just wasting everybodys time ehzhzhhsh whenever i catch up with my 4 classes i tend to think  everything is going to be alright from now on  but i always end up in the same place. in my room, in my bed. feeling like a burden and feeling like i will never accomplish anything. do i drop out of school?? do i get a job? im way too tired to do anything 0 anyways thank you so much for reading this. sending love and support to all of you lt3",
    "Dating someone with depression - help Hi, This is a throwaway account. I need some help andor advice. About a half a year ago I 32F started dating someone M42 absolutely amazing. We share interest, same humor, honesty have been there since the beginning, we can talk about anything, even shared deeply vulnerable stories and the sex is amazing as well. We seem to be able to connect in a way Ive never tried before and create this space where it is just us. Green flags all the way. I quickly fell madly in love with him ofcourse. I shared my feelings for him about 4 months into it, told him no pressure at all since I wasnt ready for a full blown serious relationship and he didnt either. I have no doubt that he has feelings for me. Non. About 2 months ago he fell deep down into depression. He told me. I told him if there was anything I could do to help? He said maybe. I told him I was there if he needed to talk. He said thank you. Asked him if he wanted to meet up again soon? He said he was feeling so bad and was overwhelmed at work he works a lot. I said no problem, you just write me when the time is better, no pressure and Im not mad. Take your time. He said he would. Its been a month since that last text, and I havent heard anything. My guts tell me to just wait, but I am worried and a little unsure of how to handle this situation.. Should I keep on waiting I am not in a hurry and if Im not going to continue my relationship with him I dont feel like dating at all right now or should I reach out? afraid of preassuring. Abandoning him is not an option. Please give me some advice or share if you have a similare story. I would love to hear from someone who has depression and who is dating someone who hasnt.",

    "Trying to initiate self care 22f here, new to this subreddit. Due to depression and lack of budget for healthier foods i work part time for 7.75 an hour Ive gained more weight than Im comfortable with. I would like to balance out my poor eating habits since Im living off of the cheapest things i can afford ramen, chef boyardee, you get the picture with more physical fitness. I have a few medical problems that prevent me from being as active as Id like. A few years ago i had an accident and broke my spine so i have hardware implanted and a bum hip. Even taking a six hour shift at work leaves me all but unable to walk the next day. Ive started taking walks, and since i live in a rough part of an inner city its difficult to be by myself and not have someone harrass me or follow me. I cant afford a gym membership so i was wondering if anyone had tips or suggestions on how i can do more from my home. If it matters Id like to focus on my stomach and love handles, its just hard because of my back and hip problems to do a bunch of situps and pushups and leg lifts. Does anyone know how to do these to reduce my pain so i can keep going longer for better results? My body image issues are really starting to affect me, and they havent before... I will be crossposting as well in a health advice subreddit. Any suggestions and tips are welcome. TIA!",

    "What would be the best way to talk to my S.O. about getting help tomorrow when it's a really upsetting subject for her even though she needs it? Lately she has been getting rid ofblocking out people who are helping her, which is why Im glad I convinced her to let me talk to her about this tomorrow, but anyways she convinced her stupid ass useless parents that she doesnt need a therapist anymore, she doesnt tell her doctor anything, she doesnt open up to her parents understandable because they get mad or brush it off. Dude FUCK them honestly and shes even blocked me a couple times for spam calling her when she attempted to cut herself 134 deep wound cuts caused by an army knife her dumbass parents never took away btw because I couldnt reach her and her parents for SOME reason trust her home alone and shes pushed away friends too. So with all this information, can someone please give me advice on what I need to address, how I should go about it, and what I should suggest she needs help for like therapist, family therapy, psychologist, etc.?

On the way back I was just upset and angry with myself and my siblings. I was upset with my siblings because they are all young adult, hell two of them are adults,21 and 19 but one of couldnt stay home for a couple of minute until the rest of my family got home. While we got to my house he didnt even park, he just stop in first we said goodbye and I went inside. I say that because he always parks in the driveway, gets out, and walks me to my front door. He did try calm me down before hand but I was just so angry. My parents were still home and asked me whats wrong and why was I upset. I told them but my mom made feel worse. She made me feel like I should have told her and that it was my fault for not knowing about his surprise for me. My dad tried to tell her that she was wrong and that how was I supposed to know about my fiancés surprise. I was texting and later was in call with my fiancé while that was happening and he was still upset but was telling me that it was not fault. That what happened was unfortunate and upsetting but it wasnt my fault. Everytime I tried to blame myself he would tell me to stop. That yes he was upset and he was sorry for upsetting me. It ended with me and him in a phone trying to make the other person feel better but it didnt work. Now he has gone to bed and Im still awake still upset my eyes burn a little due to crying.

This last few weeks has been rough, Ill spare the detail as theres some personal stuff. My concern is that wherever I go, I feel like theres this shadow following me. Like, 67 black shadow in my peripheral vision, always there. Whether Im in bed, the kitchen, the car, or out for a walk, just feel this presence behind me, an inch away from my back just towering over me. Always just out of sight, but I know its there.

    "Why can’t I quit MY job because of health problems? I love my spouse. Truly, 100. Shes the only thing that keeps me going most of the time. But Im still stuck at my shitty job, and its negatively affecting my mental and physical health. Back in February, she quit her job because her anxiety and agoraphobia got so bad that she couldnt go in to work. She just stopped going and told her boss that it was health related. She was unemployed for a few months while she searched for something else and I was the only wageearner during that period. My car broke down, we lost our storage unit, I struggled to make rent, etc. Shes working again and making more money doing something thats better for her health and Im so happy for her. But Im losing it. Im slipping. Im angry all of the time. Physically, Im in a lot of pain. My wrist hurts every time I move it. My back aches. My knee which I injured last year has never had a chance to heal properly because Im always working. Mentally, Im struggling. I cant keep going on like this. I need to quit my job. But when I say that, my spouse just says, Ill help you apply for jobs. Ill help you write a cover letter. My mother says I shouldnt quit without a job lined up. But my spouse quit her job without having something lined up. Why am I not allowed to quit? And if I mention maybe going back to work with kids again, my spouse freaks out because she doesnt want me working with kids because of the pandemic. I just want out of this job! Why cant I just LEAVE?",
    "Need help with self-sabotaging behaviors. So I have been tapering off my medications now. I have been on medications for over 5 years, and it has not helped in managing my anxiety or depression. I feel more energetic now. The issue is, there is a demon lurking in my mind which comes out from time to time and creates havoc. For example I had saved a huge chunk of money from my first salary I received last month. Spent money carefully, was responsible enough, etc. A couple of days back, I grew so emotional and reacted so badly to some things that cried till my eyes, body and joints hurt. My body fell numb and I couldnt move out of the bed. I ended up spending 75 of my savings on things that neither helped me elevate my mood or had any practical use. This is not the first time either. Everytime I tend to do something right, I would do something extremely irrational immediately and try to spoil the one good thing that I have. I constantly think of running away from my house and live a quiet life in the suburbs, where no one knows who I am and where I come from. I have lost trust in myself to an extent that I depend on validation from others for my every little feeling. I dont trust what I think or feel at all. I am lost and can see only death as a solution from this unending misery. Has anyone been through this before and got out of it successfully? If not, what are you currently trying rhaf may may not be working? Please provide some solutions that I can actually apply to my life and not the philosophical or religious ones, I have had enough of those.",

    "In those last days, my suicidal thoughts have strongly come back. Now I've found where my mother hides the knives. I've begun saying goodbye to people The title sums it up. Since an event that took place more than a week ago, on Sunday, Ive realized how messed up I was and how unable I was to socialize and be with people. Ive stopped talking about it to my family, because my father would shout at me again, my mother would joke about it and the others would judge me. Theyve badly educated me and gave me an unhealthy mindset. I hate my education and my familys lifestyle and morals. I despise what how they made me, and they cant listen when I ask for change. Im done being a weight. No matter what my friends say, I cannot see how Im not a burden. Im always bringing down the mood some have stopped talking to me about that and I dont bring anything. Im clingy and pathetic. If you look at my post history, youll see how even school tried to get rid of me because I depressed others. Its the physical manifestation of they would be better without me. Now, Ive stopped talking to people and Im about to end it. I see no other way, no one knows what to do with me. I have the means and Im ready to stop it. Im sorry to everyone who cared about me.",

So I will take the high road, keep my dignity, and attend my daughters graduation. In the meantime, every day Im gonna try to set it all aside and LIVE.",
    "Please help, i am so tired Can someone please explain? So i dated this guy one year ago. He became severely depressed and we kept texting when he felt like it.

With gifts, food, and a selfmade depression journal see my other post. And i cant wait to cheer him up with it. I texted him last Thursday if i could bring it.

    "Looking For Coping Methods My depression has been really declining lately. I live in a really bad household and Im being targeted by my grandfather whom nobody will stand up to and if I try to stand up for myself, Im the one in the wrong. Hes been yelling at me over small things, calling me all sorts of names, leaving stuff at my door for me to trip over, and more. This especially hurts because him and I used to be friends when my mother was the one being horrible and nasty She calls me disgusting, a few slurs, etc he was the one that was always there to comfort me and try and talk it out with her. Now, however, it feels like that never happened. It feels like I was the one who did something wrong, and I dont know what. Its seriously effecting my relationship with my boyfriend, friends, and myself. Its an incredible struggle to eat just a meal a day, my lips are getting torn because I pick at them, I cant ever get to sleep and stay asleep, its frustrating and since Im a teenager I cant leave this enviroment. What do I do to cope? I use music to try and melt away, I play games like animal crossing to stay distracted, I draw, I play ukulele, I just breathe and try to remember that it will pass. Im terrified of being suicidal, Ive attempted once and was lucky I know Im capable even if I dont want to and that scares me. What are some methods you guys use to deal with these sort of things?

    "26. Depressed, socially anxious, lost and suicidal. I spent most of the money I made with my dad on weed. This is how life was for about 8 years. Around 2013 i began taking lexapro and took it until Feb 2019 but it didnt really help. My oldest brother ended up overdosing form heroin 4 years after I graduated high school. I had a moment where i said to myself enough is enough, stop smoking, get your shit together and do something with your life but that was short lived. A year after that we moved to Florida. This move didnt really fuck me up as much as the first one but it did affect me a little as I do not like change in general. My drinking increased since I moved down here and I smoked just as much. Fast forward to November 2019. I turned 26 and holy shit it hit me like a ton of bricks. I had a huge quarter life crisis and realized that the past decade of my life flew by so fast and I spent it doing absolutely nothing. I stopped smoking and stopped drinking after doing both habitually for at least a decade. I told myself I could not live like that anymore and if I didnt make a change sooner of later I would look back a decade from now and have the same regrets. I began considering joining the service but honestly had no clue what I wanted to do for a career and I still dont. I just felt like doing anything has to be better than doing nothing and it might help me out of my socially anxious depressed bubble that I am in. Unfortunately around mid November I began suffering from severe dry eye which i am still dealing with as i type this. It has cost me an insane amount of money in doctors visits and i still havent gotten better. I had lasik 4 years ago and it might be the cause dont get lasik. This only has made me more depressed and suicidal. I also went to a cheap therapist for about a month during this time. I also went to a psychiatrist and took Zoloft for about a month and a half without any improvement and stopped because of fear that it would make my dry eye worse. One of the only positive things that has happened recently is I began talking to a girl i met on a dating site.",

I realize that I am just being a lazy bum and am embarrassed but I feel so chill and unfazed by flaking on all of my plans including buying things masturbating eating or anything of instant gratification and my subconscious just says Dont care. or Will do later.

    "I’m starting to have a harder time functioning Hey, Im a 19 yo male 20 on Easter. Thought that would be a fun thing to throw in and Ive been living with depression since I was 9 or 10. Its just progressed as Ive gone on. Ive always been an extremely self loathing person and the negative thoughts just come up more frequently. It just happens out of nowhere. Doesnt matter what Im doing, itll just sucker punch me. My mood gets really dark at the snap of a finger. But now its getting harder to actually cope with it and function as a human being. I think its been this way for about a year now. I used to be able to escape it if I was doing something active. Like with friends or whatever. But now it doesnt matter. Itll just fuck me up whenever. Sometimes it can get to the point where Ill have difficulty remembering things or having a conversation, I dont know how to formulate sentences, and it just becomes allconsuming. I dont understand it. My thoughts in this state range from craving substances to escape, thoughts about how nobody likes me and I dont matter to anyone, and sometimes thoughts that I need to hang myself. I want to have a good life but I dont want to live it as me. Im way too hard on myself. I know I have a charismatic personality that some people enjoy, and I can acknowledge some of my strengths when Im more level headed, but more and more I just regress to what I described earlier where my mind just tries to take me down.",
    "How do you find motivation to keep up with cleaning? I recently have come to a point where I cant stand the way Ive been living and I feel as though my apartment being a mess is one of the main reasons for that. Ive been working 5060 hour work weeks for the past two months because it keeps me busy and keep my mind off things. However, I feel from this schedule of working and sleeping, working and sleeping Ive gotten so far behind on taking care of myself and my apartment that just the thought of all the stuff I need to do is overwhelming. Leading me to barely want to get out of bed on my day off because I know how much I need to work on because nothing got done during the week. So Ive decided to cut my hours down to 45 a week, although Ill have less money I feel like it will allow me more time to take care of my outside of work stuff so that I wont be so exhausted all the time. I was wondering what trickssystem you all use to keep up with cleaning and household stuff. Does a daily chore chart work for you? Or writing a list for the week and completing so many tasks each day?",
    "What is wrong with me This is a very long post and Im sorry for that. I just hope someone reads it and gives me their honest opinion. I also hope this is the right place for it, if not then, Ill keep this to myself. Thank you all. Hi, Im a nurse student in Germany and Im currently trying to learn for my exam thats in about a month, while trying to find a job at a hospital. not always, but a lot of the elderly I work with call me the nice sister Im not an examined nurse yet, and I also dont compare myself with one, but elderly call almost every female worker a sister. I didnt quiet leave a good impression at every unit i worked at, some told me that I should work on my structure, some told me that I need to smile more because my face always looks angry, and some told me that I should apply for a job at their unit because they thought I was good. I did apply, wasnt really confident that Im good at all but i tried my best to seem confident, because I figured that no one would want to hire someone thats not confident. I applied to meet someone thats known to be very nice and that would talk to students for at least 10 minutes and then offer them a job, but I was unlucky enough to have a meeting with someone else, Mrs. D. My meeting didnt go that well, she asked me a lot of trick questions and lasted for over 45 minutes, she also asked the why should we hire you and not someone else question 4 times because she didnt like my answer, come to think of it, I dont think I answered the question at all and talked instead about what this job meant for me. at the end she told me shed talk to my teacher and the units Ive been at, and give me a call soon. fast forward one month later, which was yesterday. I was invited to her office midshift. she sat me down at a table 2 meters away from her and said we could take off the face masks. then she offered me a limited contract for 6 months and called it my second chance, proceeded to tell me that the units didnt say good things about me and then told me that Im empathyless and that people arent machines or objects.",

I have not left the house in 11 days now and can barely muster up the energy to brush my teeth and shower each day. My days have no structure and I just eat junk food as I feel too lethargic to prepare proper meals for myself. Each day I wake up late 11amish and then count down the hours until 7pm when I can start getting ready for bed again. Getting into bed is perhaps the highlight of my day as it means another day of my life is over with. My mum just came in my room and told me I need to sort myself out. She finds it all pathetic and is angry at me. I get it. But that is not what I need. Can she not see that I am not well at the moment? I also have been suffering with anxiety. Everyday there is something new to worry about. Yesterday I thought I had breast cancer, a couple of weeks ago it was cervical cancer, etc. Even applying body lotion to my arms I am scared I am going to see a dodgy mole. I just feel so hopeless. But I get these brief moments of sadness when I think to what I was like this time last year. I was in university, surrounded by friends, top of my year, genuinely springing out of bed to go to university. I dont know how it went bad so quickly. I know I can turn it around. Sunday night I prepared a simple todo list to just look for jobs and identify three I wished to apply to. A simple task which breaks down the scary process of job hunting down to tiny steps but it is Wednesday and I still have not done that.",
    "I can't do anything I planned last night to after I wake up will go to gym and start working on video editing in order to start a YouTube channel that Ive been planning to do it 4 years ago... all that Ive done all day is lying down holding the phone and watching netflix and YouTube, I forgot to eat... Ive been like this always I never finished something I started, Im also broke and living alone...

Im deeply depressed I dont know what to do, I have everything in my hand to make me feel glad... I dont work hard for my future I hate myself so much that I keep torturing myself...

    "I am suffering Wanna start by saying its okay im okay one time the police showed up when i posted in a suicide forum. I AM FINE My life is leading a very interesting and difficult path I doubt I will ever get married or meet anyone I miss my old life and freshmen college days of having friends and being a pretty girl. I dont understand my exisistence I thought I was trans for a time and went on testosterone and it deepened my voice and I am not the pretty bubbly, bouncy girl that was once popular and well liked. Men dont like me I have an entirely diffferent group of friends and sometimes yearn for the old one and my thoughts run away with me at night. I never had dysphoria I just hated my period and thats why I went on hormones. I am on birth control now to keep it stopped but I just struggle with life, humans, and wondering why I exist. Idk what to do after college I am petrified of life and I will most likely never be loved I just struggle with being 21 and progressing high school sucked I was in a homeschoolprivate school Duggar type of environment and every day was torture. But it was easier. I had not been on hormones yet. I was innocent. I was a pretty girl. I was well liked. Boys liked me. Its gone now. All gone.",
    "Girlfriend with severe depression New here, I dont know if this would fit in or belong. But I am struggling with my relationship with my girlfriend. She hates her job, constantly stressed out and while Im at work she will call and rant and often cry. I listen and try to help but feel like I am of no help. Everyday as soon as I get off of work I go to her house and just sit and try to help. She lays in bed from the time she gets home and constantly says she is miserable. She constantly says she wants to go to sleep and not wake up. She says it is not worth living anymore.

    "How can I (28f) help my Mum (56f) who is depressed and considering suicide. Previously they had a friendly but distant relationship without regular contact. Calling me and my sister at all hours of the day and night in tears mostly when she is drunk to just talk and keeping us on the phone for literally hours her last call to me was 4hrs and 42 minutes at 10pm until she feels better or passes out. This occurs approximately twice a week to both of us. Previously we would text regularly and call about every 710 days. Refusing to deal with anything concerning her Mothers my grandma, 88f increasingly poor health. She started doing this as she suspects that people think she is trying to kill Grandma which is completely unfounded. She had previously been the main point of contact for the local council and doctors for anything related to Grandmas care and has had medical power of attorney for abut a decade  a sibling has since taken over responsibility for facilitating Grandmas care as a direct result of her behaviour. She has begun drinking increasingly heavily over the the last 2years. Currently she consuming 12 bottles of wine most nights, has very recently starting consuming spirts in addition to this. She is routinely drinking to the point where she is passing out in her own vomit. Previously she was only a light social drinker. Frequently making statements such as just wanting to die, I should just die, someone should just shoot me, ill just die. This is happening multiple times in the same conversation, it must be adding up to hundreds of instances per day. There have been many other behaviour changes I have noticed but the ones listed are the ones that are new to her and are alarming me the most. For further context, she lives alone in a country town, does not have a significant other or any pets and my sister and I both live hours away from her and have done so for years as do all her siblings. She has had some major stressors in her life recently. Obviously Coronavirus has been a big thing, she is an essential worker and has been working the whole time. Her employer has recently sold their business and she is very concerned about her job stability when the new owners take over. Grandmas health has been worsening and Grandma is resisting the idea of going into a care home.",

Im currently a sahm working remotely for a few hours a week, going to be starting school online next month, and I will be looking for a job that provides more for my family. The trouble is Ive been battling post partum anxiety and depression since i had my last little one. So just a little more than 2 years. My depression had improved greatly in the last few months but recently its been fluctuating again I was sick for 2 weeks and now my kids are both sick as well as my roommate this has made things very difficult and Ive had a lot of health problems at the end of last year that made it difficult to get important things done. Well, now Ive reached a point where I have zero motivation. I just feel so overwhelmed by everything I have to get done and even making a to do list, and today sending it to my LDR partner with the idea that he will check at the end of the day to see how much I accomplished has done nothing except make me feel more depressed and anxious. Im having trouble thinking, Ive stopped eating properly and making sure to drink water every day my SO has been helping to encourage me to do these things properly and Im just having trouble making myself focus and chill out enough to get things done. Today I was going to do things... but then I had kids screaming and crying all day and I couldnt do hardly anything. Now its the end of the day, Ive managed to eat and drink water today more water than usual but not enough yet and Im just feeling really sick again. I dont know if its stress or if Im just burnt out or what it is. This might not even make any sense because Im having trouble thinking.

I tried to become a better person, I started therapy and meds Lexapro 2 weeks ago. But two days ago she sent me an email telling me she doesnt love me anymore, that shes happy without me as a partner. She also told me to stop sending her messages until I move on, that our relationship is over, but she would like to be friends some day. She sounded so condescending and harsh, she also had depression and anxiety, but she started getting better before leaving me.

I just want peoples opinions on whether they would recommend me to seek a therapist in my situation. This is the first time that I open myself almost completely and I was afraid of it for a long time. So far I have only had good experiences with advices on reddit, so I decided to post my problem here. Everything written below should try to make my current situation a little more understandable and not to arouse pity or something like that. Thanks  ampx200B ampx200B Hi, Im almost 18 years old, and Im trying to briefly summarize my life as fast as possible. ampx200B Ive been bullied at school since I was around 9 years old fourth grade. It got a little less in eighth grade, but most of the people at school still left me out. had about 2 relatively good friends. At the same time about 1415 years old I started drinking. I came to school drunk about 23 times a week and drank now and then on weekends. Mostly I drank alone. I hated going to school because of the other students and tried to make my time there a little nicer. At the same time I got to know a very good friend to whom I could open up for the first time because she also had to struggle with bullying and depression. However, I fell deeply in love with her but never told her and always pretended I just wanted to be friends with her because she was my only good friend and I didnt want to lose her. I became emotionally dependent on her. After a little over 2 years she began to feel that I felt for her she had a boyfriend at the time. We fell out and she cut off contact with me. I was devastated for months, unable to concentrate on work and just plain desperate. It was two years ago and I still have to think about her quite a lot. ampx200B In the period between 14 years old eighth grade and now almost 18 a lot more things happened.",
    "Need Help / Afraid to get labeled The stigma with mental health is strong. I know I need help, I have overwhelming thoughts of suicide and dispair, have battled eating disorders for a decade, am in a toxic relationship, have social anxieties in crowds and am a survivor of sexual assault. The problem is... I dont want to get labeled by my insurance company with all of these for the rest of my life. I worry that once I seek treatment and am 100 honest the diagnoses list will be long. I am functioning  maintain a promising career, friendships for the most part when I doing go MIA, and am physically healthy. Id say 7580 of the time Im living a normal healthy life, but that other 2025 is dark and frankly scary. I found a letter I wrote my best friend a year ago to the day basically an in case I die  hopefully it wasnt at my own hands but if it was, this is why It was actually written on a good day, where I just thought I have to explain mental illness and how its impacted me so someone doesnt think my whole life has been a mess when Im gone. Anyway, I digress, point is I found this letter and it made me realize Im still in the same situation as a year ago and I need to find help somewhere. ampx200B Does any one else struggle with health insurancedr labeling them?

    "Am I a sociopath...? This is a throwaway account. So, I have been struggling with depression for quite some time now, and I am very very concerned that I may be beginning to show sociopathic tendencies. I have a friend, who, for anonymities sake, shall remain nameless. He is my best friend, and has been for a long time. But lately, I have noticed that I feel almost like I want to know everything he does and when he does it, and he is part of a group that I recently left, and is, in fact,in a leadership position there. I left for several accumulative reasons, but one of them was because since he was in a leadership position, we where not able to converse at the group. It was hard for both of us, but we tried to follow the rules. After I left, I started having trouble with the nights that the meetings where taking place, like it was hard for me to accept the he was still there and I wasnt. Im also noticing that when we have something planned and he backs out because of, for example, work, I find that I am way more bothered by that than I should be. So, am I a sociopath, and what can I do to stop these tendencies? Thanks in advance. Tim not my real name, of course",
    "I feel lost I wont bore you with my sob story of a past, it was horrible and has left me a mental mess at the best of times. I was getting better, was motivated to keep going in every aspect of life and wanted to make my future mean more than just getting to the next day alive, and thats exactly what was happening. I had everything ahead of me, but all that has changed and disappeared. Im a 20 year old whos still living with their parents because I dont make enough to afford a place to live. Im an aspiring writer whos dream is to be published, but who gets little to no good feedback from what I do. Im an abuse survivor who continues to be abused and used at every turn, and in every way. Im a trans who finds very little if any enjoyment from my own body. I have two friends, one is my girlfriend who lives in another country, and the other is moving away from me in a month. Family doesnt want me, and those who do want a better version of me. I work five days a week, and have very little time to get out of the house. My life is a cycle of abandonment, and false promises. I have a hard time trusting others, and a harder time trusting myself. Ive been suicidal before, and Im passed that, Im to the point where I dont even want to put in the effort to attempt it.

    "We were engaged. He left me for a 19 year old he has been talking to online for the past 3 months They also called at other times during the day that I never knew about. He also put ghost mode on on Snapchat so I couldnt see when he was there talking to her, and he was always saying it was a glitch I only believed that because Snapchat really is a very glitchy app, but none of the times I asked it was an actual glitch. He admitted everything after. They were flirting, sexting and everything and at the time it was just two months after they started talking. I only found out because a few days after I started getting suspicious, I messaged him asking if she had ever flirted with him. He said yes, and I freaked out. I also found out later on that the moment I sent him that message they were on a call, and he told her so she was pressuring him to tell me the truth. Thats the only reason why he said yes. Then as I saw he wasnt replying to my messages, I called him and obviously interrupted their call. He answered. This was a long call, I told him everything I had been suspicious about and he confirmed every single thing. Then, at night, we called again. Our longest video call ever. 9 hours and 37 minutes straight. Ive been so bad lately that I cant remember everything, but how it went was basically me telling him all my feelings, how I would do everything over and over again to have the same love and happiness feeling as I did when I went there, how I would sacrifice everything how many times I would need to, just to feel that way again. Then also about our dreams of having a family and everything, how he destroyed everything within a few days. Ive seen him cry lots in the past, but nothing like this night. He was bawling his eyes out. The call lasted all night. It ended at around 730am and I slept until 830am. He slept longer than I did. When he woke up, he sent me a long message apologizing, saying how bad he felt and begged for my forgiveness.",

    "I'm so tired Thats when the topic of school opening came up, there was a virtual and hybrid option, I wanted to stay home and they were dead set on getting me back in. That led to a lot of usually hour long arguments with my mom where we went in complete circles, I was just scared and worried for my familys health, but eventually I was sent in to school. Around this time my Grandma passed away, it came out of nowhere and added to the confusion of it all. Ive always been accepting of death and everything, but it still hurt a lot to go through. I missed her, and I just had no idea what was going on anymore. I also struggled with intrusive thoughts a lot, something that continues even now. They went from anything as random as questioning my gender to recurring thoughts of suicide, I had absolutely no control of them but them just being there constantly drained a lot out of me. School was rough, none of my friends were in person, meeting new people was really hard with no after school stuff, and teachers clearly werent having an easy time adjusting to teaching this way. Motivation was hard again, I tried drawing and going outside as much as possible just so I could do something at least, but I didnt feel better. Being at school was just a constant reminder of what position we were all in, I just missed having a normal uneventful year of school at this point. Eventually cases started rising again and I wanted to switch to virtual school again, so yet again I fought with my parents about it every other day. School was miserable, no one was there anymore, no one I knew and none of the familiar faces I didnt, I just wanted to be with my friends at home at least then I could talk to them in class. My memories are fuzzy here but I remember a really bad spiral. I ran out of therapy appointments, it didnt really help anyways and my therapist never really gave me any methods to feel better instead of just trying to do things more.",

    "Please Help: Spontaneous Suicide Attempts - 25 y/o Female My wife 25 year old female whom Ive been with for 8 years, recently attempted taking her own life for the third time. I was lucky enough to notice something was up, and prevent the act. When she isnt in a depressed state, she is smiley, friendly and she even manages to excel as a grad student at a top school. She has been battling with bouts of severe depression and suicidal ideation for her entire life. These depressive episodes never seem to correspond to events, but come on spontaneously. I think its also worth noting that her biological aunt committed suicide when she was in her 30s and it was also unexpected and didnt seem to be related to any specific occurance. The first time my wife attempted suicide was in college. A friend called 911 and she was briefly evaluated at the ER and then released I think she lied about her real feelings. A few years later, she suddenly told me one day that she felt she needed to be admitted immediately for her own safety, and I drove her to the hospital where she voluntarily was admitted for about a week, and was finally set up with a psychiatrist. This is where things got a little bit better for awhile the psychiatrist prescribed some medications that really seemed to help, a lot. She seemed to get down less frequently, and she said that her depression was more mild and less frequent. She also said that the voice that tells her to harm herself was far less common. Her medications have been adjusted a bit over the course of a couple years Ive included the current medication regimen below, but unfortunately things are still far from alright. While her depressive episodes seem to be less common, she still has occasional, spontaneous serious suicidal ideation. Recently, she made an attempt in the middle of the afternoon that I was able to stop, and by that night she was smiley, laughing and back to her normal self. This latest attempt has made me realize that we are not out of the woods, and she needs more aggressiveserious care if she is going to survive. I asked her if she was fully honest with her psychiatrist about her suicide attempts and her ideation, and she admitted that she has downplayed it.",
    "I have no one. Living in my own for the first time. And I have no one to talk to. Ive moved out on my own under extreme circumstances. So in about August of last year my family and I were evicted from our apartment. My sister is off and married and my brother stayed back in Idaho to finish high school. My mother and I moved to Virginia because my aunt had a house they were paying for but werent living in. And we lived there until January. My aunt is now getting a divorce for leaving her church. And her husband lost his second job. So the house couldnt be payed for and was a liquid asset. My mom had been applying for Disability since shes been the victim of domestic violence with all 3 of her marriges. But since we barely moved to Virgina everything was still based in Idaho. Food Stamps, Medicaid, and goverment records and stuff. So she needed to move back to Idaho and quick. But it took us a month to get to Virginia and cost 3000. We sold our car. So the whole time in virginia I payed for internet, phone plans, and storage back in Idaho with a job at Mcdonalds with no transportation. So we couldnt afford a move back. But a wonderful old friend of my moms back in Idaho that had been housing my brother this whole time decided to pay for a plane ticket back to Idaho for my mom and house her too. So she paid for that and my mom just barely paid her back with tax returns. But right before my mom left I moved to a different town in Virginia I decided to save her money by living on my own with the money I had saved. It has been good for 2 months rent. I had to quit since I didnt have a car and I start a new job tomorrow. But Idk if Ill make enough money for next months rent in time... I realize Im all over the place. But mainly Im on my own. Ever single member of my family is cross country. And I had to leave them all under extreme circumstances. Im homesick and scared of going homeless. I just want some comfort.",

I play competitive games and always want to be on top but its never good enough. when i am working i want to learn everything i can to be successful but it is ever enough. when im with my gf and start thinking about the perfect woman, she is not it. but i mean, nobody is. my ideal perfect woman changes all the fucking time, and im not dating a super model anytime soon and even if i was i still would probably find something to criticize about her. There is something wrong with the way I think. i think? but idk what to do. Im always overly critical of EVERYTHING. my appearance is never good enough, my work is never good enough, my foreign language skills are never good enough, my gf is never good enough, my rock climbing skills are never good enough, my home is never good enough, my voice is never good enough. EVERYTHING is flawed and I hate everything...except for when i am extremely distracted and something has 100 of my attention, or Im drunk and have to focus 100 of something to even function. wtf do i do? i love my gf, but i dragging her down. i dont want to curse her with a life of babysitting my emotions, but when she wants to break up with me for being a downer i get even more depressed and beg her to stay because im confident she is the one in that moment.",
    "How depressed do you need to get before you decide you should be off work sick? Im very depressed and its mostly due to my job, which is immensely complicated and the depression means I cant focus on the main work Im doing. I can still otherwise do simple tasks, but the core piece of work Im supposed to be doing, which is huge, urgent and stressing me out beyond belief is something I just cannot focus on and the more I try the more I become depressed. Im trying to figure out if I should be off work sick. The more I fail to get this huge, urgent bit of work done, the more stressed and depressed Ill get, but how long should I continue down this route? I have told my manager and colleagues that I am suffering from depression and that it stops me being able to focus on large, complex work, but the task still needs to be done. They remind me that I can ask for help, but I just cant understand anything, even when explained to me and the task is incredibly urgent.",

    "I've stopped doing things for myself Ive got this roommate situation going on where Im literally afraid of the person Im living with. Hes a drunk and can be erratic and most of the time I just stay holed up in my room with the door locked trying to stay under his radar. Hes supposed to move out at the end of the month, but you know, who knows if hell actually do that. Hes basically indigent so I see no reason for him to move to a new place and not instead just root himself here for us to evict him. My other roommate is in another country until February and I live in a completely different state from my family. Im isolated. That being said, Ive stopped caring for myself almost completely. I dont remember the last time I shaved, got a hair cut. Covid is a good excuse to not get a hair cut, but I feel just disgusting. Getting up and taking a shower doesnt work. I just lay back down. I might have a problem with my car, but I dont want to take it to the shop because Im afraid it might be my only escape if things get bad, and Id rather it die on the road from a fleeing event then just not have it at all. But at the same time, is that just my brain rationalizing? I dont know. I have to get it fixed though because I have to use it for work. I just feel hopeless.

    "How in the actual heck does one love themselves I have a very bad problem in that the only way to love myself is that I receive love from other people a potential girlfriend. This is apparently very unhealthy and self destructive. Problem is, that is all I know about how to love myself. I have been told to love myself but I find that VERY difficult to do. I was raised in a household with a mother who was infuriated and enraged with seemingly small things and took things way too far pretty frequently. She took a lot of her anger out on my father and she did so in plain sight of me and my sister. Her use of pure hatred and rage towards my father rubbed off onto me. The difference is, that unlike her, I have the common decency to keep all this inside my head. A lot is directed towards the outer world and a lot is directed towards myself. I cant love myself, because the only two things I feel for myself are hatred and rage, so I look to unspoiled minds for affection. I know this is self destructive and it will just push me closer to pulling the trigger or jumping off the cliff, I know that. ampx200B I am looking for real, tangible, practical and usable advice for how to love oneself. The only advice I have received so far is that, You should love yourself. Great, what the heck does that mean? I have received advice like, Engage in your hobbies and court yourself. Well I already have hobbies and I do nice things every once and a while, no effect there. Plus, I dont have much time to engage in hobbies since I am a college student and despite having some money in the bank, I need to make more this summer. ampx200B If you have any advice, it would be greatly appreciated.",

To complicate matters, I just dont have much energy to expend in making a complex meal or the know how to do it. Any recommendations for something I can take to eat at work?

When I was 16 I started to feel empty and scared, I was scare of the night, I was scare to go to sleep, I started to push all my friends away and I stopped liking the things I used to do.

    "I feel constantly lonely and as though I’m hated by everyone Ive been feeling this way since I started year 7 and it has been constantly eating at me. I always have a persistent feeling that my friends arent actually there because they like me but rather because they feel bad for me or pity me. I havent ever gotten properly close to girls in fear they will hurt me which is a fear that derived from my past experiences with my stepmum and my real mum. And even if people assure me they care and are there for me, I always feel like they secretly hate me and theyre planning to hurt me or theyre talking about me behind my back. I usually just sit on my bed and cry about these problems and have been having many thoughts that the world would be better without me. I managed to tell my dad I felt worthless but his response was thats normal at your age and youll feel better soon, just speak to people but I cant bring myself to speak to people out of fear of them hating me or me inconveniencing them. Im really unsure of what I can do, and I feel lost, and all these feelings and emotions have only strengthened since lockdown started as I havent spoken to people much and have been alone all the time. And a experience that only strengthened this feeling of loneliness was last night when I was in a call with my friends but they ignored me every time I spoke and I think they forgot I was even there.

    "I’m sick of everything, my life is just meant to be miserable. Its a long post, but I will appreciate any feedback from anyone who decides to read it! My struggle with depression started around 20172018. Im currently 18yo. Sometimes Im more stable than the other day, there are the times that Im capable of controlling how I response to big waves of emotions. But its never totally gone, it likes to come back and my behavior is often caused by some unhealed memories or habits from my lowest times. I get embarrassed when I get emotionally involved into a conversation, I hate the thought of making my mental health an excuse, but sometimes I just feel like I just ran a marathon, I lay down and I cant help but cry because of such a failure my life is and how weak I am. I have an abusive father, my family and I tried everything to solve problems and help him change but he wont listen to anyone. Our family is pretty much divided to responsible men my oldest brother and my father and women that should do everything around the house so everyone else, especially my father, can live comfortably. I have five siblings. Since Im the oldest girl Im expected to be the major housekeeper except my mom. Im also the one with the most sense of being fair and respectful towards what I have and whats given to me, thats why I rarely skip my responsibilities or deny any request or help. I feel overwhelmed about the amount of stuff I need to do, not to mention the way my parents treat me when something is not done perfectly. I graduated high school with average results, Im neither the smartest nor the dumbest person on earth. I dont have any specific abilities nor passions to pick a solid university major that would make me happy and open a career path that would let me sustain myself. Now that I can apply to college, my score is slightly beyond the minimum. I picked a major about Korea, the country and the language, its something I got interested in, I am studying Korean for a while. But when I realized how much points you have to have to get accepted I lost any excitement that I had, I barely meet the requirements, most people have tens of points more. I dont stand out in any way. I was never liked at school.",

My depression consists of lack of interest in all of the hobbies I have, disassociation from friends and family and not caring about them, mental fog that causes me to make mistakes at work which Im then yelled at for, fear of death and meaninglessness that takes over me, and feeling worthless and incompetent at life. It doesnt matter that I eat clean, exercise regularly, write my thoughts down, meditate, force myself to practice my hobbies, go to work nearly full time, take classes, keep my car and living space clean, force myself to socialize, or try to be what is generally accepted as a good person. Life is fucking miserable. I cant make sense of anything. If I try to make a point, an argument shuts it down. Then I question my view, change it or adapt it, then argue that point, then it gets shut down. Its as if there is no truth in the world at all and nothing is real. Its so goddamn frustrating it makes me break down. And then I think about how Ill never be like a normal person who can just be themselves and move on with their lives. I feel guilty for everything I do that I cant prove is the right thing. I just want to die all of the time and I even think about it in the middle of working or playing music, even during these intense moments where I should be focused I can only long for death and a cessation to the pain. Im also in physical pain from multiple injuries that are long term and past drug abuse which Im sure fucked my body up. Im too afraid to actually kill myself because I know Ill just go into a void and my go clings onto life selfishly. I probably dont deserve to live though I make sure to tell myself I do. It doesnt help. I just want one thing to make sense in life, but everything is so confusing and Im no good at any of it. Ill start my semesters of college with straight As, keep them till 23rds of the way through, then lose focus and end up with Cs or D and have to retake some classes.",

Not sure what to do now and feel like just giving up. Im 17 this year and went for a free mental health checkup a few days ago parental consent and knowledge not needed which confirmed that I suffer from Major Depressive Disorder. Ive been feeling the symptoms for a little over a year now and attempted suicide a few months ago. Now that I have confirmed that I have depression, Im not sure what to do next. They recommended that I look into getting a psychiatrist and psychologist for medicine and counseling respectively, especially since my family has a history of depression. However, since Im underage, I need parental consent. Im not close to either of my parents or any of my siblings and I have quite a lot of bad memories from my childhood as well. Additionally, my father has quite a negative perception of depression which definitely would not help. My younger brother has had suicidal ideation for the past year as well his school found out and told my parents so my mom in particular is very concerned about him. I dont want to burden them further or open up to them about this at all, and since my brother is not mentally well either, I feel that my parents should focus more on him. At the moment, none of my friends know about this diagnosis and I dont intend to tell any of them either. I pushed away my two closest friends a few months ago and I dont trust anyone enough to tell them either.

Were a pretty sad family all together honestly, but thats all Ive known from them. ampx200B For some backstory My dad 61M fixed up my grandparents old house the one my mom grew up in over the course of a few years. The old house was falling apart, and my dad wanted a new place to renovate before he got too old to do so. My mom never wanted to move in, but reluctantly agreed once my dad pointed out the benefits. ampx200B So here we are, a year after we move in, after all the garage sales and selling the old house, getting rid of sentimental items we couldnt keep and all the junk we didnt want. And shes spiraling, guys. Ive always been her person to vent to, since Ive been alive. And every night she tells me just how tired she is, of everything. How she misses the old house that they spent over 30 years in, how she hates every tiny thing my dad does, just blaming him for everything. She cried into my arms tonight asking what she has to look forward to everyday, to just tell her something good in her life to look forward to. And no matter what I said she would just cry harder. ampx200B I dont know what to do to help her, if anything. I know my dad isnt going to help because they argue just about every day and havent got along in like.. 15 years. My mom doesnt have many friends either, just her sister and some people she cleans houses for. Is there anything I can do to help her on the bad days?",

And they also said that they kick me out when I try to go there on my own Ive always been told to not cry because a man doesnt cry but now my mom told me that its bad to keep everything for myself and I should express feelings rather than having a really neutral and cold personality When I do talk about my problems she blames it on me and tells me that everyone else can do it better than me again... This is why I prefer to be in my room all day long because I know as soon as I walk to the living room umm being yelled at",

    "Everybody seems to be “adulting” so well. I feel like I’m the only one who can’t cope. In the end I failed a module only to repeat and pass it the following year. Because I do not talk to my parents about how I feel, they still think I want to be this amazing fashion designer. Since then, I have been battling on and off with these intense feelings of sadness and worthlessness. Everybody seems to be adulting so well. I feel like Im the only one who cant cope. I dont know what I want in my life. I have no passion for anything. No values, ideals, goalsnothing. When I try to find something that I might be interested it, it starts off well but I am eventually overwhelmed by crippling fear and anxiety. I am at a point where I feel like I dont deserve to be good enough. I cry a lot. I feel like a failure. I feel like I have failed my parents expectations of me. I feel like I have failed everyone around me, I feel like I have failed myself. The only expectations Ive ever had for myself were to at least meet the expectations of the people who literally sacrificed their time and money to raise me. They didnt have to Im kind of adopted, but they did. But even that I cant do. I just wanted so much to be someone who has made their parents proud. I have now moved away from home and work as an English teacher abroad. I really needed a break from everyones expectations. And I thought that moving halfway across the world would help me with that. But clearly, it has not. Because have to deal with everyones expectations of me here as well. And I am not coping well. I always tell myself to be tough, suck it up. I always make it seem as if Im okay. I thought that I could do anything I set my mind to, that I could be good at anything so long as I try. But I cant. And for that, I feel less than. I feel like I dont deserve anything.",
    "Looked in the mirror I have run into 2 major problems in my life atm, it has been eating away at me for the better part of a month. Ill give you some backstory I have people pleaser all my life. I feel like I have always gone with the flow, with peoples expectations of me rather than have my own. I have done that since I was a kid and Im now turning 20 this year, And with that being said the first problem I have run into is, I dont know what I want and like partly due to the depression. But mostly due to the fact that Ive never really done or said what I wanted to to outside forces shutting me down at every turn school, parents etc.. Idk and its driving me up a wall. 2 I thought hard about the people pleaser trait in my being a lot and I have come to this conclusion, I hate who I am. I believe that I am selfish and feel because I havent done what I have wanted in my life I am inauthentic. So I go and look for outside validation and love because I feel like I am incapable of it. But when I receive it, and it doesnt hit the way I wanted it to or things are too fast or far. Like a addict I dump them and look for a new person to give me that feeling I long for. Its fucked up, because the other people care about me and I do to to an extent, but I prioritize my own feelings and shit first. And that realization fucked me up so bad. Real bad. Any thoughts would be great because Im so lost rn. Thanks",
    "How do I gain confidence when almost every person I've talked to has put me down for my appearance? Sure Im doing all this self care for myself, but I need to feel accepted by someone. Ive never had a girlfriend, never had a best friend, never had someone I spiritually resonate with. Ive never had anyone. I was physically abused by my father and Ive been completely alone ever since. My entire existence has only been suffering and I dont understand why Id be put here just to feel pain and suffering all while completely alone. I just bottle up all my emotions and pretend it doesnt bother me but of course its eating away at my sanity. I dont have to be gorgeous or the prettiest man but Im just tired of hearing how ugly I am. It breaks my heart so much I can literally feel pressure on my heart just thinking about how wrong Ive been done over the course of my entire life. I guess the main reason I typed this all out is really to ask, how do I keep going even though Im completely alone? How do I keep living knowing that Im all Ive ever had and nobody is there for me? How do I find the motivation to keep being a kind person when all Ive been shown is repulsion for just trying to be myself. How can I find a friend or girlfriend that cares about my opinions and point of view on life without making me feel ugly and worthless. How do I find any reason not to end my life with the gun thats in the room right next to me?",
    "Ketamine Infusions I know its not something widely used yet, Im just wondering if anyone has used ketamine therapy for depression relief and what that experience was like. The good, the bad, anything. Im trying to decide between ketamine therapy and microdosing to help instead of traditional meds as the medication Im on now seems to be causing more issues, as well as ones in the past. I would ideally like to try something else rather than another new anti depressant. Thanks all.",

And she has a depression so I try to help her and when we are together she seems happy, so I try to always do things with her. But every times that we are not together she text me that she is sad and feel very depressed. And this time she went on vacation with her family in an other country. And its been a week that she feels that way the problem is that when she is like this she does literally nothing else except staying in her bed.

    "I feel down for no reason at times, even while being with friends Sometimes Ill be doing good and having fun with friends and then I just start feeling sad. Theyll usually ask if Im good and stuff and I say things like yeah Im fine. I dont really believe myself, and I know they dont either at times. They tell me they are there to talk if I need, but since I feel depressed for no reason I dont know what I would say to them. I want to talk about it but all I know is that I randomly feel depressed for no reason, theres no big event or smaller event its just random. What are some things I could talk about? They want to help me and Id like to receive it, but what am I supposed to do? Just tell them I feel depressed for no reason at times?",

I was off work because of an injury for over two months, and with covid I just cant get out of the hole. I just want to curl I to a ball and cry and never come back out.

    "I don’t feel like I’m enough and I need help Since the age of like 11 I would often get waves of depression and anxiety suddenly. Im mostly fine for a majority of the time and after each wave I try to pick myself up and go on like nothing happened, but anything either I or anyone else does could get me back down the same rabbit hole of wanting to die. My current theory is it stems from stress related issues caused by a dysfunctional household earlier in my life because of my parents divorce. It was rather messy, mostly because of my father. With these waves of depression I often find myself getting very paranoid that people are speaking about me behind my back and that everyone hates me. I also start to believe that Im absolutely worthless and a pile of living garbage. I get really distant from my friends and family and my immediate reaction is to block them on all social medias and not talk or look at them. Lastly, while these waves happen with no pattern that I could sense I always seem to carry this guilt and shame of my past which leads to my almost always sad behavior. If anyone has any advice please help, Im so tired and I have no hope.",
    "Has anyone tried brain stimulation therapy? Sorry if this has been asked before I cant seem to find many people talking about their own experience. I saw an ad for it in my psychiatrists office and dont know how to feel. Ive been on medication since I was 14 and it all seems to wear off eventually, leaving me back where I started, so the idea of treatment for people whose depression is medicationresistant sounds helpful. Anyone able to tell me their experience? Did it help? Do you like how it felt? Do you feel it lasts?",
    "just need to tell someone this Im 17. Today is my Dads 70th birthday. That might be surprising to some people because thats pretty old to have a 17 year old son. Peers have made fun of me and said im probably mentally retarded since my Dad had me when he was so old. This isnt what the topic is though and it doesnt even bother me. What does bother me is that my Dads 70th birthday is just a reminder to me that I dont have much time left with him. At most another 10 years and thats optimistic. It just makes me so fucking sad beyond words to even think about. My Dad is my favorite person in the world and I can not even comprehend living a single day without him. I just wish so bad that I could be like every other fucking person and have a young Dad so I could have some more time with him. I truly dont know what Ill do when he passes. With how old he is, it feels like theres really no way of knowing, when. It makes me sick to even think about it. but the hard reality is is that he could really die this year even. Or he could miraculously live until 100. But deep down I know that I have less than 10 years with him and it FUCKING KILLS ME. anyways if you took the time to read this poorly written rant, thank you",

I dont know whats wrong with me and my sleeping. Im always so tired. Ive gotten my bloodwork done and everything was great there, so I dont know whats wrong with me. I can easily sleep the whole day. I usually sleep around 12 hours a night and it never feels enough. The worst part is getting out of bed. Im also a really gross person. It takes so much effort for me to do dishes, shower, do laundry, heck, even brush my teeth. I am gross. Im getting so many cavities. I cant even walk in my apartment without stepping on things. My parents say that cleaning it is the least I could do for them and I cant even do that! I cant even take care of myself! Im probably going to lose my job! Everything requires so much effort and even when I just start with one thing I get so exhausted from it. Im such a dysfunctional human. I get an email from school Im in culinary school the other day saying that Im very close to reaching my limit of hours missed and that if I miss a few more, I wont be getting a diploma. I always do this. I used to be such a good student. Such a good daughter. And for years Ive just descended into this nasty incapable mess. I dont know how to get out.

    "My Heart Feels Like It's Emotionally Bleeding I dont want to constantly worry. Im diagnosed with general and social anxiety with depressive episodes because of the aforementioned and it never ends. I have a wobbly relationship with alcohol, because it allows me some reprieve from the constant weight of worrying, but I have a tendancy to not be able to stop and get irritable, which is absolutely one of my biggest reasons to feel ashamed. Im cutting down, I dont consider myself an alcoholic but I feel its lack of presence. Ive been known to even go so low as to abuse a strong painkiller I was given from hospital for something unrelated. I feel lost a lot of the time and its come to a point where Id rather talk anonymously to people on the internet than my partner or friends because, for once, I want to be the reliable one, the happy one. The one everyone enjoys... People love my energy when I have my good moments, and honestly... I do too! I want more of it! But fighting your own mind on a constant basis, introverted... Always giving what I feel is 110, its draining, so draining... I desperately want to hear ways people cope.

    "Just at a point where I’m tired of feeling like this. Without pulling on heartstrings. Im 33F on my own. Depressed and on Prozac. Had CBT for 3 months and Ive worked so so hard on trying to focus on me. New job. A great job. Dream job. And its the perfect distraction. And then I finish and go home and just cry. Cry for the stuff I have experienced. And I grieve for the loss of personality and character from myself. Grieve for the fact I dont ever think I will fix myself or be able to have a life with someone and stuff. All because of mistreatment and bad situations leading up to this point in life. My heart hurts all the time. You know like the sinking gut heartache feeling when you receive bad news. I get that every minute Im awake. And I just cant fix it. Ive tried and tried. Im so lonely and so withdrawn. I just want it all gone. I have made 3 Suicide attempts since October 2020 and I keep telling myself that its not that bad Im 33. Im alone with everything. I cant even validate myself anymore. I try. I have an amazing job. A roof over my head. A good salary. But theres something missing and I just cannot shake it. I purchased some nice underwear at the weekend just to feel good about myself. I wore them and then cried because whats the point.

Maybe I just act dramatic I cry a lot without any specific reason, I want to kill myself quite often, but... I dont know if I really need therapy? Maybe its just who I am, just a lazy whiner? And when I will come to therapist I dont know what to say, what if that day I will feel fine and they will not believe me? I dont look like I struggle all the time, people around me dont even know that I have problems, Ive always been a comedian in a company. Im just a little bit afraid.

    "I need help communicating with my depressed wife. I love my wife. I really do. It breaks my heart that our ability to communicate has broken down entirely. Everything I say runs through a negativity filter and gets interpreted as personal attack. Seriously. Ive been told Im too logical. Which might have some situtational truth to it. Not all conversations call for logic, and I probably do apply these processes to more wishywashy, emotional conversations than I should. But Im working on not always trying to be Mr. Fixit. That I overthink and analyze things that dont need to be analyzed. Which I think I know what shes getting at, but Im unaware of any problem that was solved by not analyzing possible solutions. I know not every complaint is a request for a fix. But when its a constant refrain of complaint for weeks or months, maybe its time I tried to help alleviate? And that I talk too much and dont listen. So I make active efforts to listen and say nothing. Even when painful and untrue accusations are flung at me. Like supposed infidelity or that I dont love her anymore because her depression has caused her to gain a few pounds by over indulging on icecream. Even when I feel like I should tell her those ideas and accusations are not only unhelpful, but deeply untrue, and hurtful to me, I just take them on the chin, because when I have attempted to reassure her of their falseness, in the past, that I still love her, thats taken as needless contradiction and proof that I dont listen. In response to these accusations, Ill respond something like, Okay, Ill just listen then. How does that make you feel? And I get the angry response of, See!? Just like that! Youve always got an answer for everything! I have to be missing some piece. How can I promise to only listen, and ask a question, and by the time it gets to her ears, it has mutated into an antagonistic criticism or correction. I feel like Im totally locked into a Twilight Zone episode. How do I communicate with someone that will reject the behavior they just asked for?",

    "How do I stop the fear of getting too attached to people? Hi everyone, A bit brave for posting this on my main, but here it goes. My attachment to people is a big issue. It has definitely led to heart ache, sadness, and disappointment. So  I got this great job a couple of months ago, every day was a challenge and something new. My colleagues are great people  I genuinely love speaking to them, and just overall having a good time. But  I have an issue of getting too attached to people and not interpreting signals correctly. This eventually leads to the other party to not dealing with me anymore I dont really blame them to be honest and just... cutting me off. This has eventually developed into me not opening up  or being personable with people as I am simply too scared of this attachment growing. Sometimes they message me out of work We all have each other on social media, big mistake on my end! and I just leave on seen or reply blandly, or sometimes in the middle of a conversation I just never reply, simply because I feel like this will go down the same road as before, just being too attached. Every day I struggle keeping myself composed I take photos just to get my head off things, this is the only thing that gets me going through the weekend. Should I tell this to my colleagues? Should I keep it a secret? I really dont know. At the end Im just not happy with how I am. I get suicidal ideations every single night and just remembering the relationshipsfriendships that I have fucked up literally gives me anxiety and it has definitely caused some sort of trauma. I dont go through with suicide because I just think of my parents on how sad they will be. But  once my parents pass away I am planning to fully commit as I really dont want to live this crippling anxiety with every single relationshipfriendship.",

I just want to stop being so powerless all the time. To top it all I sleep very badly, overthink everything. I thougt having some outside from work activities would help. I have been in therapy for depression for 15 years and the last two years went really well, so my therapist and I decided to stop. Now I just fear that my tiredness is just a symptom and that its startig all over again. Has anyone some advice? Or ideas? Thanks for your time reading this.",
    "Wife has been struggling with postpartum for 18 months Our son is 18 months old and my wife has been struggling with PPD since the first week. In some ways she has gotten better. The first month she would have breakdowns and cry and would have to leave the house. Since then she just seems apathetic to most things. A typical day she wont want to get out of bed. I work remote so I will grab our son and change his diaper and feed him breakfast. She will get up after I ask her a few times. Being alone with our son stresses her out. Most days her mom will come over and watch our son or she will take him to her house. She usually just lays on the couch or in bed on her phone most of the day. When I get off work we will go pick up our son. Once we are home she will usually sit on the couch and she will interact with him a bit, but I do most of the child care. Once our son goes to bed, she usually will lay down in bed. She will usually have only been awakeout of bed for 8 hours total. She has told me she doesnt want to be a mom. It breaks my heart to hear her say that. I want my son to have a mother who loves him. I know she does but the depression covers everything up. She has been on different medications and is going to therapy but nothing seems to ever help. I dont know what to do anymore. I want to help but I dont know how. Some people in family have said we should do tough love and make her take care of our son more, or go out and do things. I dont think it is that easy though. Does anyone have any advice?

I only recently started trying to fix it and started taking some meds which Ive been on for about 3.5 months now. Whats the point of it all?

Im finding myself almost in tears at work, for no reason at all. Earlier this week I came home, sat down on my couch and just started to cry. All week Ive had 0 motivation to do anything. I still ended up going to the gym for a couple yoga classes hoping it would at least make me feel a bit better, it didnt. I just want to know if this will ever get better?

    "I'm losing my mind and need help. I contemplate suicide everyday. I don't see any future anymore, just think I'll kill myself one of these days. I need help. 17 year old male, 18 beginning of July. Ive been struggling with my mental health for all of my life, and it got worse after starting puberty. Ive always been terrible with social groups and interactions. Never managed to make a lot of friends, and those I did never sticked. Had some of your regular trauma from parents and older brother. Ive always felt alone. When I became a teenager I started with the depression. Got very bad episodes, where I would shut down, and fake illness so I could stay home. I missed one month of school once, and on a trip to Italy for school I faked illness for two weeks so I could stay in bed, and could only think about jumping off a bridge. As I got deeper into adolescence not only did my mental health deteriorate, but my ability too. My memory became poor, and my focus was gone, always having mental fog. I couldnt remember words, and speak eloquently. Math ability went to the shitter, always making stupid mistakes that would then seem retarded later. My IQ seemed to have dropped as much as 10 points, since I have periodically been applied tests and only perform worse. Starting high school made me much more suicidal because of this, and the isolation of not knowing anyone, and the people I did know wouldnt even look me in the eyes. I had already gone to a psychologist, and after that a neurologist, and recently a therapist. Got medication, and have been on it since 2017. The doctor has changed my meds more times than I can count, and none of them have helped. She told me that I would probably never be off of meds, but they still dont help me. I have no cure. I feel I have been slowly getting worse, going down my own dark little hole. Ive always been obsessive, but now it feels like its all I am. I feel like Im losing my mind. Everything makes me irritated, or break down.",

I make up some excuse that Im sick but like with a stomach bugnot admitting that Ive lost all motivation. I need help. The depression takes such a strong hold on me some mornings. I need advice on how to push through the negativity and just go to work. Its so hard for me. I want to work. I want to pay my bills and live a normal life. But those mornings when depression is taking overnothing is enough to motivate me. I called out again today. I was sobbing in my bed. I told my boss I was sick. She finally had enough and yelled at me. I dont blame her, really. But it just made me hate myself more. I hate that Im like this. I currently take depression meds which is why I have some good days. I just need advice on how to help my morning blues. Anyone? Im tired of feeling like a lazy, unreliable loser. Help?",
    "Angry Issues Causes Everyone to Leave, Should I Be Alone? I have always had anger issues and an attitude that no one has ever liked. A lot of my family, friends, have experienced this side of me and either refuse to talk to me altogether, ignore me, or block me and remove me from their lives never speaking to me ever again, even if knowing them for years on end. So lately Ive gone off on family and friends and it made me feel bad afterwards. But now I feel like I want to just be alone. Not talking to anyone at all, because if I dont then I cant get angry or show my ugly attitude etc. Part of me just feels terrible and I just dislike who I am as a person. I want to be a better person and for everyone to love and care for me, but all I am doing is pushing everyone away. What would you do?",
    "I’m dying inside 💔😩 I wish I could stop all this major pain I feel. I want to impress but I also could care less about who thinks what. I wanted to make you feel proud, but we see how that went for all of us. I try hard everyday to make myself proud of my achievements but its just not worth it as much as it used to be. I used to be so proud and so excited to try my hardest for the things I loved, but notice that all of a sudden it doesnt seem to matter anymore kills me. Where did all my friends, family and love life go. Down the drain it feels like. So where do I go from here, do I keep trying or do I go get help bc I just dont feel like I can do much of this alone for much longer. Do I give up completely? To feel so damn alone is crushing me and to feel I mean less and less every day isnt exactly healthy. You wanna know how I made it out of my moms hell hole psycho rage house. Ill tell you, Im forever damaged and looking for full approval on things. I only end up attracting the worst people and I cant seem to keep a solid person in my life bc she ruined my way of judgment. My aunt tries hard to fix what I cant even fix myself. I just want to feel loved by friends and someone I hold so near and dear and care for. But to do that, I HAVE TO HAVE FRIENDS, and NO ANXIETY ABOUT MAKING FRIENDS, AND SOMEONE NOT HURTING ME. I fear everyday that Ill fall back into my old habits and go suicidal. I almost want to know what its like to do drugs and get away from this world. I feel the pain rush through my body like electricity. I practically enjoyed that one girls night that I got so wasted that I was slurring my words for once and passed out naked in my own house. I enjoy darker things and its getting to dark to decipher whats ok or not anymore. I hold in so much anger and pain that If I let it all out Id probably cry for a week straight. Sleep cry sleep cry, it would be the worst cycle.",
    "Any advice on working full time with depression? Ive had a job pretty consistently since I was 15, Im now 27. Ive always worked part time because it made it easier to manage my mental health. Im now in pretty desperate need of a good job and Im willing to do full time, Im just very nervous about getting burnt out fast with the typical 40 hour work week. I know so many people with mental health problems manage to do it, and I would love some advice.",
    "Cleaning service? I feel lots of shame posting this. I pretty much live in my partners room she lives with roommates. Both of us have depression amp anxiety symptoms flaring up, and she has chronic pain. Weve been very isolated to our room. Its already been cluttered and disorganized by her move 1 year ago, and since we have very little energy, its more and more cluttered, including boxes of takeout. Its state affects us very much and though weve tried again and again to gain motivation and energy to at least do small things, we havent been able to do much. We talked a few times about reaching out for someone to clean and reorganize our room. I also know a few skilltrading groups where I could ask for help, and offer some kind of compensation. I also thought of asking friends for help, but Im scared of imposing. We dont have that much money either, but honestly we havent been able to do much for a while now and I just need help to take a step forward. I just feel like Im being very lazy doing so. And Im not sure where to start. Did anyone considered or tried doing something like that? Does it make sense?",
    "I'm literally living in a mess Im not sure if this is exactly the right sub for this but Im pretty sure I cant be the only person in this position and I cant handle too much judgement about it because I an already beating myself up so much for being disgusting. This pandemic has hit me hard. I live by myself, I lost my job and my relationship. I am a mess. My family all live very far away. I am falling to pieces and every night when I pass out crying I pray I wont ever wake up. The main trouble is my apartment. Its a one bed tiny place to live but its mine and Ive always loved it. The work I had used to take me away a lot and this has always been my sanctuary. However with everything thats happened and the dip in my mental health it is now disgusting. I havent cleaned in months. I havent done laundry. I havent showered or put sheets on my bed. I literally have no clean utensils or dishes or pans. There is baked on food from months ago and actual mold in my cups. I have taken to hiding under my covers because I am so disgusted with myself. I have a therapist who tells me to take baby steps and one job at a time. But I have done nothing. I am on medication but my motivation doesnt seem to be improving. I am at my wits end trying to know what to do, I have been down before but I have never got as bad as this. I guess Im asking for anyone else that knows how this feels, HOW do I get out of it? I am trying to pull myself together but Ive been trying for months and Im failing miserably. If it wasnt for the pandemic I would genuinely use the last of my savings to pay someone to come in and deep clean but that isnt an option just now. I am so miserable",
    "FIRE!!! I cant take anymore stress. Anymore loss. Ive had enough. Ive fallen so deep into a depression that Ive completely let myself go. And I mean completely. I barely have the energy or drive to crawl out of bed. There is no function in my life anymore, Im simply existing. I am pretty much alone now. Ive lost everything. I have had nonstop loss and stress since June of 2018 and its not letting up. Im at the point now to where if Im lucky enough to sleep, Ill wake, up wondering who in my life is going to die that day or what terrible thing is going to happen. ats what it feels like. Like Im outside of myself watching The last straw was the breakup of my 9 year live in relationship. He came home from work and dumped me out of the blue. He moved out 3 days later, leaving me with our large rental house, its utilities and other bills. We split everything and Ive had to take over his share. My elderly mom lives here with me and her income helps but she is ill and is now developing either Dementia or early Alzheimers. I loved my ex so much and his loss alone has nearly put me under. Its been 9 mos since he walked and I found out he had been cheating online. Well thats over and now he has a new girlfriend, my worst nightmare was the day I was going to have to see that. She has money and I really think thats the only reason why hes with her, which is sad. We have stayed in touch mostly by text and he sees our animals we owned together. Now that he has her he no longer wants to see all of our animals and doesnt want to talk to me. He told me it hurts him to talk to me. Yeah right!!! I may be severely depressed but Im not stupid. Add the Covid stress to everything Ive had to deal with and I feel like Im losing it. Ive never gone this long without a shower. Ive never gone days at a time without sleep. Sometimes Ill go 4 days without eating. God help me.",

    "First post ever, need help This is my first post ever. Im not diagnosed because Im scared to ask my parents to take me to see someone. Severe anxiety and depression along with bipolar disease are all common in my family. Im the only one who hasnt gone to therapy. I cant remember being truly happy. I remember all the way in kindergarten, so anxious about starting first grade, I had sleep paralysis for the first time. I cry constantly in private. I feel trapped in my parents expectations. I would love to be sad on the outside and just cry it out sometimes, but they expect me to be happy. I play softball and volleyball, I used to do kickboxing. My parents expect me to be a badass who smiles while they kick ass. Ive been hiding how sad, alone, and numb I feel for years. I have addadhd I cant get a straight answer from my mom so its hard to focus. They offered me meds, but my mom said no. I was bullied severely last year, I was told to kill myself several times. Im going in to high school in a different school district. Im coming out of a funk, but I know Ill go back down in a week. My parents yell at me for everything. My sister has called me fat, ugly, and stupid for as long as I can remember. I dont know what to do or who to tell. I broke down and cried for hours on end to my best friend. She understood and was shocked because of how Ive hid it all these years. Can anyone offer any advice. Anything anyone can offer will be appreciated.",
    "At 43 (M), depression is new to me and I don't know how to handle it. But once my wife had something with friends that didnt involve me, I realized that I have nothing but her. I have no friends here, and havent seen my coworkers facetoface since early 2020. Ive met my wifes coworkers and have even been to a lunch with one or two of them and really enjoyed it. But for some reason, theyve lately wanted to do the girls dinner thing. My wife knows Im down a bit. She doesnt really know the extent. Im not suicidal, but I wouldnt mind not waking up one morning. I cant tell her that because a I dont want her to feel like its her fault and b shes very prone to depression herself, and the last thing I want is to spur her into a bout of it. Having said that, I keep playing one thing in my mind and Im worried its going to make me resentful If the roles were reversed... say in 2019 when she was really depressed about our new situation, and some coworkers wanted to meet up for dinner with me, I wouldnt even THINK about doing it without her. Hey honey! I know youre crying because you hate your job and are questioning life, but Im gonna go eat with the boys. Like... I cant even IMAGINE that thought process. Either way, Im constantly on the verge of either sleeping or crying and I tried reaching out to a therapist in my network that Ive spoken to before when this working from home stuff started bothering me and no one even has video appts. available until July. Then again, I dont even know that therapy works for me.",

Im tired of life. Im mad at myself because I dont trust anyone enough to talk about my problems. I wish I had the balls to end it but I dont.

    "Loving one is Depressed :/ Hey guys, so i was daiting with a girl and after trying and trying she couldnt get any feelings for me. We got into a big conversation about it after 2 months. She never told anybody and never ever talked about it with somebody. She told me that she is Depressed. I asked for some reasons and when it started. She told me that it started in high school because her parents have really high hopes in her and pressuring her pretty much. She is 19 now. I feel like she told me as well the reason why she cant love me is because of her depression. I told her that im ready to help her anytime and all. But she doesnt want help and really doesnt like it when others help her. She doesnt cry infront of anyone because thats a symbole of weakness she tells me. I really care about her. It even feels like it hurts me more then her to a point. I dont know what to do. And i feel like if i will be there for her that one day she might feel how it is to love somebody. Since she told me that she never loved someone really. So if anyone could give me a tip on how to handle the situation that would be the greatest thing ever. I also asked her this question on a scale to 010 if 0 is that she loves her life and most things are going well and 10 is i want to kill myself as soon as possible. She answered 8. Im really concerned. And getting a therapist isnt an option as well for her. She would never take any pills either or so. She isnt Religious, she feels the best if she is just alone and if she has her quietness. She feels pressured if she is outside with her friends etc.. She also doesnt find relationships appealing. Maybe because she never had a goodreal one with feelings but that is just an assumption. She has guilty feelings because she started daiting me and wishes me to find a better one. She doesnt really like herself etc etc. Dont understand me wrong. Outside she is a extrovert, like nobody would know that she is actually depressed im sure.",

I feel so pathetic unable get out of this pit Ive put myself in, being demotivated to do school work, lacking enjoyment in things I used to do. I recently during a lock down before my mocks told my parents briefly about how I was feeling, but didnt come forward completely, probably as a fear of being judged.

    "Did I destroy my brain and chances to be happy? I was on strong antidepressants since I was 15. I often abused drugs and alcohol. Back then I remember reading about how dangerous the combination of seratonin boosting stuff like ecstasy and antidepressants can be, but didnt care. I continued this risky game for about 3 years, when I was 18 and decided on my own I wouldnt need antidepressants anymore and immediately stopped taking them. I had horrible withdrawal symptoms  irregular heartbeat, almost passing out several times a day, cold sweat, dizziness, I felt like dying... so after a few days I took my meds again because I couldnt take it anymore... I lowered my dose each day until I felt like I could take the withdrawal symptoms. Now the thing is I am 21, have a girlfriend, have a fulltime job, but absolutely no joy in life whatsoever. I do absolutely nothing. I cant even bring myself to do the bare minimum. All I end up doing is swiping through social media and thats it. Every day off. My girlfriend likes to go out for dinner, the cinema, shopping, or even just go for a walk and so on. Shes basically dragging me along, I experience no happiness or joy, no matter what she suggests or what we end up doing. Theres just... nothing. Weve been together for 1½ years and I can tell shes getting exhausted. I am so sorry for her. Shes a wonderful person, I really love her, but she was so unlucky to fall in love with a person whos basically a wall.... Is there any chance I can fix what I fucked up in my youth?",

I rarely make food for myself which causes me to lose weight and I was already underweight before I became unemployed.

My parents are constantly pressing me to create contacts that will help me in the future and I feel bad for not doing this because its like I am missing half of the university experience. I have reached the point where I prefer Mondays over Fridays and Saturdays because I dont have the pressure from anyone to hang out with someone, in fact I now dread Fridays and Saturdays. I feel that if I continue in this state I will get ill like as in an actual disease, I am the living proof that humans NEED social interactions and are a SOCIAL species, I am getting desperate, I want someone with whom I can share my musical tastes, my fascination for books, football soccer, history, to have deep conversations, someone who has my trust just as once my old friends had mine and I had theirs, someone to go on adventures AND TO LIVE LIFE. I am now so embarrassed of myself that I CANT LOOK AT MY DAD INTO HIS EYES, my dad is a very compassionate and good person, but I cant look at him to his eyes when we talk, I simply cant. I have problems showing affection even to my parents who I deeply love but I cant externalize that feeling and I dont want to be like this, I want to have the courage to say I love you directly from my mouth and to be able to feel it truly, I want to have the courage to hug someone without getting uncomfortable, to say nice things when I feel them, to stop being a pessimist piece of shit and finally be happy at least for one entire day. I perfectly know my my mom and dad and I know they think to themselves When will this guy bring a girl or organize a party?

I really just want to be able to feel nothing, more out of convenience for my own and everyone elses sake.

I feel more like Im just waiting for everyone to leave just so I can die without fucking anyone up. I know Im quite smart  the only good thing I would say about myself and I kno there are people with lot bigger problems who still keep going but that thought only makes be feel more guilty but I also know everyones pain is still significant, I just go in a constant circle.

    "I don't feel original anymore. When I was in high school a few years back, I was one of the highest competitors in my school. I joined the high school band in freshman year and by senior year I became one of the best in my section. My academics were always straight and I exercised daily. Senior year I enlisted in the military and now I believe it was one of my worst decisions in life. Before I went to boot camp I was motivated, a patriot and believed that the elite joined the military. In senior year I never applied for any scholarships and I was offered one but turned it down because I already signed the papers. I thought I set myself up for success. Now I believe I was dead wrong for joining. The only benefit I see so far after a year and a half of service is that Im trying to set myself up financially before I get out and hopefully attend college. It sounds like a plan but I feel no happiness from what I do at all. I convinced myself theres no honor in it anymore, its just another job. I dont exercise by myself anymore. I feel like Im not progressing anywhere in life being in service. Im just a body and if I wasnt here doing what Im doing, thered just be somebody else doing the exact same. Im replaceable. Thats the mindset the military gave me. I look forward to going back home in 6 months for vacation and thats the only thing Ive been looking forward to since Ive been stationed. After that, the only thing I have my eyes on are getting out of service, going home, being closer to my family again. Theres nothing here that satisfies me and I hate it.

Other things like academic aspects, going deeper into a topic, studying neuro science or pharmacology esp. neuroscience was a love of mine, I spent a lot of time with it and it was the reason for me starting the bachelor in psychology is almost impossible for me because depression makes me dumb, disabled and very restricted in thinking or making. Im sorry for the long text. Thanks to everyone who read until here. What are your thoughts? Do you have experience with this and somehow managed to improve the situation and feelings? Do you have ideas for projects or hobbies I could try to get into and maybe find a passion in to kill my feelings of emptiness, negative thoughts and self worth issues? I would be happy about any idea, anything, thats somehow manageable even when being depressed and socially anxious. Something I can hold onto, improve in and get feelings of success and self worth or skill. Something that distracts me from negative thoughts and psychological pain of depression. Have a nice day, I wish you the best! lt3",
    "I don't know how to deal with this anymore. Since I could remember Ive always been off emotionally, Ive tried therapy, and medications it never helped. I should probably give context but, I am just lonely to the point where I feel like nobody gives a shit if Im alive or dead, even though I know I have people that care. I get really kind of crazy if you will, when Im having a depressive episode. When it gets really bad I isolate myself from everyone around me, and it usually helps calm me down if Im getting to manic. This would work when I had school and saw people, I was able to sort of have a connection to the outside world, then Id go home and not talk to anyone and just listen to music and exist. Now that we have a selfquatantine all day Im just alone, and when I have these episodes I have no one to turn to. Even to my closest friends I feel like a burden, and I dont want them to worry, Im aware at how cliche I am. The last few days have been really hard, and I just dont know how much of this I can take while being alone. I just feel very panicky, alone, empty and depressed, and usually my episodes dont last several days, but this one is, and I dont know how to deal with it now. My only coping mechanism doesnt work anymore since I cant go to school then isolate myself. And its getting awfully painful just being me, and living like this. I know and hope itll be better soon, but right now things look awfully grim and I dont know what to do about any of yhis. I dont know what Im expecting from posting this, Im just hoping maybe writing it out could help somehow.",

Supposed to go at 730 ish To be clear Ive been once before and thoroughly enjoyed it. But still cant shake feeling really sick because what if I make an idiot of myself? What do I do when in there?

Seeing her go on and then offline all day is starting to drive me crazy and I have been crying for the past half hour because I thought I could rely on her.

    "26. Depressed, socially anxious, lost and suicidal. A big part of my brain focuses on high school and that fact that I pretty much did nothing during it besides smoke weed and drink. I had freinds but I feel like they werent genuine freinds, just other people who enjoyed partying like i did. Most of the summers I spent alone sitting at home. It was like that in middle school too. I remember joking to a kid on the bus in middle school, telling him I go home and stare at my wall for hours then i go to school. I never had a girlfriend in high school  just a few hook ups. I regret not joining the track team multiple people said i shouldve, I was really fast. I wish I had an intimate relationship in highschool. I was always pretty smart but I really just stopped caring about my grades at the start of freshman year. I had a lot of angst and spite against my parents and I attribute that to why I stopped giving a shit. Pretty much all i thought and cared about in high school was smoking weed. I shouldve been focused more on joining a club and my grades. Although marijuana was a huge escape that I initially loved I feel like it was one of the worst choices I made because it only made me more introverted. It also made okay with the fact that i was doing nothing with my life and not thinking about my future. I had one job as a bus boy which i quit after about 2 months. I graduated high school as a below average student wirh absolutely no clue what I wanted to do in college. I went to a community college for a month before dropping out. While there I felt extremely out of my element, only talked to fellow freinds from high school who also went there, and made zero new friends because of my social anxiety. After dropping out my life as an extreme recluse began. I worked but it was with my dad doing roofing and home improvement type work. I only hung out with one friend from high school and going to his house and getting drunk with his family at their house parties was the extent of my social life during this time. I spent most of the money I made with my dad on weed.",
    "Advice on how to deal/make progress So, Im currently in a hole with my depression, and I could use some advice on what to do and ideas on how to approach things, as Ive done a lot already. Its a bit of a story, but I will keep it as brief as possible. If youre reading this and want to help, thanks in advance! So depression has been a thing all my life, but I only got a diagnosis around 10 years ago Im 33. I am also disabled, having a diagnosis of autism and suffering from chronic fatigue. I got therapy, and eventually, medication. The therapy CBTlike didnt really help, but at least talking to someone was nice at times I had a good therapist. The medication did help. I was put on 50mg sertraline. Fast forward a few years, and I start to do worse. I get sick with bowel pain that appears to be persistent. A few other difficult things in my life happen, and my depression starts coming back. The pain eventually becomes so hindering I have to stop work entirely. I get a pretty intense comprehensive therapy program for dealing with unexplained symptoms, and it is overwhelming. I lapse back into deep depression. The decision is made to up my dose to 100mg sertraline, and I climb out of it. The lessons I learn from therapy eventually help, and helps me control the pain and lessen it somewhat, although the fatigue actually intensifies. Fast forward to around now, covid times. Turns out, telling someone with a tendency for severe depression stay inside and have as little contact as possible is a recipe for bad times. I live in a place where I dont have a social network, a result of them moving away and me trying but so far being unable to because disability and dependency on social housing, which is a mess. So events were very important to me, and theyve all been canceled now for about a year and a half. I honestly do pretty well for around 10 months longer than I expected, before things get bad and I seek out my psych again. The decision is made to up my sertraline dose to 150mg, although I note I am seeing a pattern of it stopping working every 3 years.",
    "A therapist doesn’t want to see me because I have trauma. What the fuck. I feel so confused. I had a consultation with a potential new psychotherapist yesterday, to which she told me we should both take 24 hours to think amp see if were both a good fit, to which I was fine with even though I already had my mind made up based off of the description of servicesexpertise she had listed on her website. After the 24 hrs passed, I havent heard back from her, so I emailed her following up about our session, and stated Im confident with moving forward with them, just for her to email me back basically stating that she doesnt feel shes a good fit for me since I have CPTSD, and how shes still an intern, meanwhile she CLEARLY states all of her credentials, some mentioning acute AND complex trauma! Along with helping marginalized communitiesLGBTQ. I should note Ive seen two other counselors at this practice, but unfortunately cant see them due to changes in insurance. They were the ones who referred me to this therapist. I feel so alone and its been SO difficult finding help. This was a kick in the gut for me.",
    "I ( 26 female ) have decided to take care of my severely depressed younger brother (20m ) by letting him move in with me last week and need some tips. I booked him an appointment with a family doctor on Friday  tomorrow  and I spoke to my own therapist who recommended me a program to recommend to the doctor for my brother. They do a more intensive followup for mental health adults that lasts 2 years and they work at the patient s pace... My fear is he will give up or not accept the help even though he told me he is open to it last Sunday. Yesterday he started getting hesitant again saying he didnt want to do the work but also he is aware he needs to get better.. What my concerns are  1. Basically I know that I have what it takes to help him and objectively he is better off with me that he is with my parents and since he has nowhere else to go I wont let him starve or end up on the steet. But, I want to know how to get past my own emotions and fears and anxieties regarding this entire situation and NOT identify with his depression. 2. I want to set healthy boundaries also where I dont get caught up in saving him because I already feel like Im trying to do that... but I dont know what that would look like... should I give him a contract or make him sign a promise to himself  what do I do if after a year he has not progressed ? Should there be consequences  not punishments but, a different recommendation ? I dont want to end up taking care of.him forever I want him to heal with me and get back on his feet. 3. Moreover, I dont want his depression to trigger me and I dont want his negativity  not shaming him he is just very depressed and sick and needs help but his depression makes him so negative about everything  to bring me down, I want to keep pushing for a better life for myself and my brother without the negativty bringing me down as I worked so hard to get to a somewhat surface level healthy mindset  I say this because I.myself can get easily triggered and spiral if things feel to overwhelming especially when it comes to my family  ...",

Now Im lost. I needed that. That was my happiness. After I was ghosted my heart just fell out of my body and I immediately started going into a depressive phase again. I need support.

By that I mean they do whatever they want to and they dont care about my opinion at all. And when I try to talk to them calmly they just say stuff like  This is how we are and you cant do anything about it. They also call me hopeless a lot of times and say personal things to me and this has always happened but I expected it to stop when I turned 18 a month back. Theyre currently angry at me and theyre blocking the wifi and my sim card for no apparent reason and I just feel so helpless. I cant talk to them or make them understand how I feel. When I told my mother that I have nobody in this house to talk to she said aw youve had such a sad childhood youre so innocent but im sorry thats just how it is. They take away my phone whenever theyre upset and Im stuck in the house because of quarantine and I just dont know what to do. And to make it a little clear, my real dad was an abusive alcoholic and my mother STILL says stuff like that to me. Ive also lost touch with almost every friend I have. I do talk to them but its empty talk. I only really have one person in my life that I can talk to, and that is my girlfriend.

It got so bad that I had to get outside help which made my teacher even more mad so he started insulting me straight to my face, as well as behind my back, saying he doesnt want anything to do with me and basically disrespect my entire work and from my schoolmates tell me he is quite proud of it, it got to the point where my parent had to go and talk with the school. I wanted to press charges More fun news came when all of our sponsors pulled out before we could sign a contract with them so we got no money ATM so basically Im getting shit at school invested 10x time than anybody in the project as well as the 1500 that I may not get back, also possibly severe lung issues.

I had a similar situation already a few years agochoosing a school where I got close to attempting to take my own life, took me 2 years to recover, I made myself a promise that it would not repeat with MIT and now I feel like it might happen and that I will be left with nothing and alone, just an empty shell devoid of happiness and any hope for tomorrow.

    "I'm seriously considering suicide again. I wont label my social issues, as I havent got a clinical diagnosis like anyhting else on this list, but I think it fits more into the antisocial category than asocial or social anxiety, because of my negative and possibly misanthropist views. I have 2 past suicide attempts, once by asphyxiation, and the other by insulin overdose. Now, Im just wasting away, induging myself and slowly poisoning myself. My only friends 3 or 4, whom Ive always valued highly, are distancing away from me slowly, after nearly 6 years of friendship to be honest, I dont blame them, because Im fucking weird to hang around. But it does hurt quite a bit. I have a cousin 3 months younger than me, who has a much better and more successful life than me. His father my moms younger brother by 1 year is the current president 33rd of the KoreanAmerican Association of Chicago and a Northfield Township trustee. My cousin has a better social life, better health he is ripped as one would describe, and taller than me, while I am barely keeping my muscle mass together. Im 56kg, 170cm, has better looks than me, is a better student no problems in school and is just allaround a better person than me. People follow him around, and as much as it hurts my pride to admit this, I am envious that girls just follow him around. My family isnt very supportive neither. My aunt and uncle cares for me I hope but treats me as if I were some lazyass scum, because their son is objectively better than me, even though I am doing my fucking best, trying not to die from a DKA every day. I lost 56 pounds in 2 weeks, all muscle mass, because I dont have much body fat. I excercise semiregularly 45 mins a day, 34 hours a wekk, maybe, I study, I do what everyone else does, and I even put more time into it all possible because I assist school once a month now, all assignemnts are submitted through a school intranet.

    "Can we trust depressed people? I mean, a depressed person who is struggling with their feelings and thoughts. Sometimes they are themselves but sometimes they are not when they let the depression take over. So should we trust or how much should we trust things that a depressed person talked about their feelings? Will they change their mindfeelings from time to time?

Honestly Im getting really sick of feeling sad and angry all the time and when Im sad I couldnt stop crying and I couldnt control my tears which is pretty bad in Singapore where Im living where general people will isolate you when you show any signs of mental health issues. And I couldnt make any friends here because of my nationality and all the prejudice I get just by being myself has been repeating itself in my mind every day. Not only that but also workplace bullying has led me to be even closed off and led me to not be able to leave the house because I felt as soon as I step out of house people will judge and isolate me which make me feels like there is no point of going out anymore.

    "things to do on last day alive? February 10 is DDay. I just need more ideas on how to spend my last 2 months. I am completely broke so thats important to remember. not looking for mental help btw, Im not on the fence  I already plan on  writing letters to all family and friends  hanging out with closest friends one last time  finally finish my book  shitty scifi short stories  then burn it  burning everything I own, destroying journals, hard drives, religious books, childhood pictures. writing a will amp testament  suicide note  buying a dress  stand up comedy at an open mic night ampx200B Im so fucking excited and sad and I just wanna make sure I cover all the bases before I go lol. thanks for reading",
    "Who contacts first? So my crush who I had a thing with for over a year, I guess kinda an ex. broke things off saying they werent interested and needed time for themselves. Basic stuff. Now idk if it was their really bad depression that pushed me away or them genuinely losing interest. Either way we talked for a bit after, then I started kind of going no contact... Im wondering if that was maybe a bad idea. I mean I figure if they cared they would reach out? But if theyre really depressed, even if they missed me or whatever would they take the no contact as rejection or that Im not interested and not say anything at all? Long term Id like to date them, I mean we kind of basically did before... so Im not interested in being friend zoned, but I also dont want to hurt them. People say just be honest to them and tell them how you feel etc. and I get that but A. Pouring out your feelings isnt attractive if theyve lost interest B. Isnt productive if the goal is to get back together imo. Idk, any thoughts? I care about her so much, we had a good thing, and when it ended it was on friendly terms",
    "Stuck in a rut I think Im stuck in a depressed rut and I feel like I need to take action before I go further downhill. I really cant be bothered to take care of myself lately, I have no social life beyond working and seeing my boyfriend 23 evenings a week, Im close to my mum but thats it. I find social interaction completely exhausting and overwhelming and yet crave it so much. The time off over xmas has left me realising that I just have no drive anymore. Ive just sat and smoked weed for days in front of the tv computer and everytime I try and do something productive I give up because I either feel ill I do have a cold atm or just dont feel like I know what Im trying to achieve anymore trying to clear up my house. I was going to the gym and eating healthily in November then I went through a stage where I wasnt eating much at all so stopped the gym in fear of making myself faint had a weird turn and fainted which freaked me out I just cant get myself back into it. I have all these great ideas of things to do to help myself but I have no clue how to do it. My boyfriends a total antisocial introvert so hes not really much help, I need to do this in my own time for myself. I guess Im asking how can I motivate drive myself to do something and not just feel hopeless all the time? Im on antidepressants atm and have been slowly decreasing my dose for the past couple of years, this is my first winter on the lowest dose... do I up my dose again until Im back in a better place? Also, how do you not feel guilty about relaxing doing something for yourself? I realise I always feel bad about spending time doing what I want but I dont know why. Ugh Im such a mess and so fed up of feeling low, I needed to get this out of my head. 2 more days alone to get through. I cant even be bothered to make dinner, just eat whats to hand. I feel so hopeless and useless",
    "I feel like I can't anymore. When I was 15 I thought of killing myself almost daily for 5 months straight, I broke when my mother saw me have a panic attack and called me dramatic, I told her I wanted to kill myself, she told to do it. She has always been abusive, verbally and emotionally and I have been trying to get better on my own because going to therapy is so expensive and I am 18 and not allowed to get a job. My father died almost 2 months ago, he was the one who loved me, he was the one who heard me but now I have my mom that sometimes is nice and sometimes is the worst and a brother that when he gets mad threatens to punch me or slap me. I feel like life is just over, I haven been hours staring at my ceiling thinking how the world would be a better place without me, that I am worthless and I feel like I cant take this anymore. My country, Ecuador, doesnt have suicide lines and I feel so alone, this is my only way to reach help, please, please, help me, even if its a little.",
    "Ungluing myself from my bed Im someone who spends around 16 hours a days on my bed. I sleep there, sometimes eat there, sometimes study there, most things I do are done on the bed. Whats important is it needs to be seen as a place of sleep, and it limits what I do. I want to be asleep and awake at sensible times. I unhealthily use my phone in my bed for things I probably find boring, like a zombie, too the point where I still use it when I get tired. I want to make sitting down attractive, or standing attractive, or walking attractive, or I want to make living on my bed feel unattractive. I do have ideas on how, but Id like to hear other peoples ideas and thoughts. In my room is my desk and chair, my bed, and my floor. I also have sofas in my shared kitchen, with a TV, and 3 flatmates, though Im hesitant to interact with them. And, I obviously have the outside world. The things Ive tried is buying a cushion for my chair, and using one of those hand resistance things thats just a tool for fiddling that cant really be conveniently used in bed while on my phone. I was thinking of getting some PC games that Id be able to run smoothly on my lowperforming laptop, or investing in a Nintendo Switch, as I know that Im spending most of my freetime doing things I dont find enjoyable and I like playing Smash Ultimate. Thank you for your time.",
    "I just realized I'm very depressed but I don't know why. Before today, I didnt even know or even seriously consider that I may be depressed. To me it just seemed normal, and probably due to the gradual increase of the severity I simply didnt connect the dots. From what I can recall its been going on since I was around 12, back in 2014. First I remember becoming quite lazy and finding getting anything done an incredibly hard challenge. I thought it was just because I was a teenager, and lazyness is a normal teenager status. Then I started having a lot of anger issues, Id get pissed off for the most minute things, I had an incredibly short fuse but I just thought it was also normal teenager behavior. Eventually I managed to suppress those explosions so theyd go off in my head but no one would notice. I started to lose interest in things I used to enjoy a lot, like math, and went from reading 30 books a year to reading 0 last year. I think I was around 15 when the first suicidal thought occurred. Every time Id fuck up and get grounded or yelled at, or faced consequences for my actions Id just think over and over again that I wasnt worth anything. Those thoughts disappeared for some time, but arose back last year. I, again, thought it was normal. I think the reason they stopped is because I was at a relative high in my life, I had entered college at 16 years of age and everyone I knew was proud of me, and I felt good about myself. Or so I think I thought. I feel like I can speak for any teenager out there that mastubating is normal. Yet Im not sure when, it became a daily thing, and then 2 or 3 times per day. Also I stopped showering, I dont even know why. I just didnt. Id go into the bathroom, turn on the water and just sit on the toilet looking at it or my phone. I stopped cleaning my room and then stopped washing my clothes. Id wait till the last pair of underwear, maybe reuse it a few times and then wash enough clothes for a week, while months of clothes were piled up. My dandruff got much worse, and the suicidal thoughts came back every once in a while.",
    "I have a friend (she's my cousin but we're very close) who's talking about trying to kill herself and starving herself. Do I go to the guidance counselor? My friend is really struggling right now and is trying not to eat. I found out from a mutual friend a guy shes talking to romantically and she admitted it to me very willingly herself. She showed me their texts and she was talking about doing it because she wants to kill herself so she wont listen to anyone who tells her to get help. Im thinking about going to the guidance counselor because she already expressed that her parents wont schedule her an appointment even though shes asked. Shes diagnosed with depression because shes had one appointment but never got another. I dont want her to be upset with me and shes telling me herself to force her to eat. So I dont know if I should wait it out or go to the counselor.",
    "I feel like I need to die Hello, Im 23 at the present moment, Ive been on therapy and antidepressants for almost three years, had some highs and bearable lows through this time, but I had some breakdowns that really feel worse each time it comes around, like a neverending cycle, and Im passing through one right now. I feel helpless, unable to reach out to anyone either because they dont care, or they just dont know how to help me and that makes me feel even worse. I feel like my mood naturally pushes them away. I dont know if I want to hear anyone say hey pal, this is temporary, youll feel better later because this also means that I will feel like this again in the future too, and I just need it to stop once and for all, I dont know if I can fight much longer.",
    "How can I convince my friend who is struggling with depression to seek help or let me help him? So basically my friend 16 who well call joe has been struggling with depression for months now. He used to be very open with me about it, and would frequently vent to me about his problems. About a month back, joe was at his worst, and he cut himself. I understandably was very concerned at this and brought up the idea of seeing a professional who can help him. He wasnt very open to the idea and I think me mentioning it made him feel I was worrying too much about him, because now it seems hes telling me less and less every time I ask him how he is doing. The other day his mental health came into the conversation and he told me he has no idea why he feels so bad all the time. I tried to pry a little bit, but he made it clear he doesnt want to talk to me about it because 1. He doesnt want me to worry about him, and 2. I wouldnt get it. Fair enough... so I told him he should see a professional who can help figure out why he feels bad all the time. He said he was too scared to see a professional, which I completely understand so I offered to help him find someone. He flat out said no and changed the subject. I think joe is depressed and most certainly in denial about it. Hes told me hes not depressed, just sad, but he doesnt know why hes sad. He obviously wont talk to me anymore about it, and hes scared to find someone who can help him. It would be extremely beneficial for him to talk to someone who is trained to diagnose mental illnesses, or can at least help him understand why he feels like this. So how can I convince joe to either find someone who can professionally help him or let me help him find that person? Thanks Im advance for any feedbackadvice",
    "Any good wholesome livestreamers/youtubers to watch so I feel calmer? My anxiety and depression are really bad these days since I returned home from college summer break. Weirdly enough, I miss the noise of people talking and hanging out, specially in my dorm, and now that Ive come back home I feel pretty depressed with all the silence. My dad is working, my mom is pretty quiet, they both go to sleep before 9pm, and my house is pretty far away from the city no buses, and I dont drive so nowhere I can go. Ill be here for a month and a half, and I think the silence and lonely feeling will drive me crazy.

    "My twin brother (turning 19 soon) is depressed and won't get help. What do I do? Title kind of spells it out but heres more details My brother was diagnosed with depression in junior year of high school. It seemrd like hed been suffering with it since middle school, though my family and him didnt recognize the signs then. Since then hes gotten better and it feels like I actually have a brother again, but its not easy. Lately he got his medication raised, but has been sleeping more, feeling no motivation, looking sad, having a hard time focusing. Im currently out of state for college we are freshmen and hes staying home with our parents. His GF contacted me recently and said shes worried that his depression is getting worse. He doesnt tend to talk to me about it so I believe her. Thing is he has access to a psychiatrist but he says they cant help because I dont tell them anything and doesnt really answer why he doesnt actually talk to them. We suspect he has anxiety too but that hadnt come to anything yet His school offers free therapy which Ive taken advantage of at my own school but he doesnt take it, nor thinks he needs it. Im extremely afraid im going to lose him and his gf and I dont know what to do. Weve talked about getting him committed but we arent sure how or if that would actually help since hes already isolated he hasnt made friend at his new school yet Does anyone have advice??? Please help, I dont know what to do.",

I know that Im not, but Im kinda starting to believe it. Some days, the most minor inconvenience can cause me to just give up completely and start crying. During these times, I just feel that life is pointless. It used to be not as bad, but now its escalating and I dont know if I can take it anymore. One of the worst parts about this, is that Ive started to shut out my friends and family. I feel really bad doing it, but I have do do it. One of my friends, who I thought I could tell about this, started to tell others and they made fun of me. I was traumatized. I dont want that to happen again. Please, help me with this.

    "Unemployed, alone, and my birthday is tomorrow Hi everyone, I moved to Canada in April, and its been a rough ride. Despite everything, Ive been trying to keep my head up and be positive, however today Im afraid I dont have enough energies for that. I must have done something wrong in the past, because this is the 3rd time  in my life  that I get fired 10 days before my birthday. The job wasnt really working for me and I was already expecting that to happen. Its just... its the third time. It cant be just a coincidence. I cant remember the last time I showered or the last time I washed my hair  I think I did leave the house 2 days ago to get food?

    "Today I reached my rock bottom I flunked the bar twice and what is more painful is that ALL my friends passed. I am happy for them but there is a part in me which thinks I am inadequate for not being able to pass it. Everyone I know, even those who do not do well in law school made it. No comforting words can console me. Every time I take a nap I really I would die. I am even having this evil thought I get corona virus or something. My sister shouted fake news when she thought I passed. I saw their excitement. My parents ran towards me. But when I said I actually failed again they just turned their back and left. No comfort whatsoever. So now I am all alone. Images of my ex when we were breaking up during my bar review was recurring and his words which go like I have nothing to be proud of. I just proved him right. My friends are all cheering up on me but everything is just cliche. And what do I expect? They cannot mourn with me bec they are all celebrating. I am currently employed in a law firm that I love but if I have to take the bar again, I need to resign to pave way for my review. I also dont want to stay because the work would get me reminded that I am not a lawyer. It is heartbreaking to leave a firm I finally love. Then bar in our country is moved to 2021 due to corona virus. I am going to derail my life for 2 years. I am more than delayed. I feel so left out. I see no purpose in life. I am starting to give up on my dream of being an attorney. I want my life to end. I think Ive seen enough. This life keeps on knocking me down as I am that strong. I used to be but I reached my end.",
    "I have always been the \"supportive\" and \"strong\" friend, but now I'm losing it... All my life Ive tried to do the right thing. I usually give counsel to my closest friends without asking for something in return. I am the strong, the one who never gets sad or has emotional issues. Nevertheless, I am losing it. I am tired of being strong I am tired of appearing happy all the time I do it for them, not because I am in the good mood all the time. My family does not know it either, but I have to go on with my life for they need me. I am tired of loving everybody without receiving a portion of that love. I learned to love my loneliness, but now it feels like I need someone, but finding a partner who wants something serious is extremely hard and I am not a Greek god, to be honest. I do not like dependency, however, Id love to have someone to talk to besides my friends. I lost my best friend last year since I fell in love with her dont do it, worst idea ever.

Im lonely, and I just want a single friend. I dont even have friends online. I have asked in groups, forums, etc and nobody responds. Whats wrong with me? Am i even here? Am i a ghost? Im so lonely and I just want a single friend. It all started in 2017, when i graduated highschool. My friend group quickly feel apart. People moved, went to college, worked, etc. It eventually just became my two friends. Then my one friend left and joined the army, Ive tried to talk to him but he ignores my messages. So it was down to just me and my best friend. Long story short he was a dick. I got married and he was suppoused to show up to my wedding as my best man, he never came. My wife and i then decided to move away and start our own lives. We moved from Texas to Northern Wisconsin. Idk anyone here. My wife is my only friend honestly, but i need real friends.

    "I want to be happy again. Goal Currently I am all timer sad and want to be happy. I am neither a good person nor a bad person. I am somewhere in the middle or maybe totally out of circle. I dont know. I feel like I am living three lives. One which I show to my Family, one to friends and excolleagues. I am jobless. And one my true self which I show to myself only. Of course any differences in personality from my true self I manage by pretending someone else in my other two lives. But as soon as I enter my room and after carefully slowly locking my door I throw away the mask I was wearing and then I can clearly see the differences in my voice, thoughts, body language and goals, if any. My body feels so relieved. Then I start getting back in my true zone where I forget the tasks and goals I had planned in my mind. And I start feeding myself the worthless shit on Internet. At that time, I am only looking for that temporary dopamine hits because nothing simpler was giving me any joy. I started losing myself in weed. I sometimes was stealing weed from my friends or roommates. After smoking for at least 3 years, a small joint was not that powerful anymore to bring down the curtains covering my real life problems. So, I jumped to eating. Now again, simpler food was not any joy. Junk is pretty much gonna hit the Dspot. Small meals mean less dopamine. Give me more and more. Dont worry, Ill puke the previous and eat again until I am so wasted by the effort of eating  throwing  eating throwing and of course the taste of food. There are consequences too. Bloating, Gas, Always upset. But nothing can stop me from doing it again and again atleast from last 2 years nothing has stopped me. Then in search for more dopamine I look for porn. Again, simple means no joy. Fell into HeteroBBC  Trans  Sissy. Now I dont imagine me having sex with girl instead I am that girl and big funk is fucking me. I started dreaming about dicks. Bought a vibrating dildo.",

    "How does therapy start? Hello fellow redditors! I have been suffering from depression and suicidal thoughts since I was a teenager. I have often theorized if therapy could help but actually going there was always out of question for a variety of reasons. I have read what therapy is supposed to give you no cure, but a more endurable existence? but never how one goes about the whole thing. How do you choose a therapist? Do you just walk in and just start talking about all the bad things? I have never confided in anyone so it just seems more than obscure to just walk in and tell a stranger that I want to kill myself because there is no purpose to it all anyways... I appreciate any feedback!",

That made me feel better for a little while, but I cant help feeling a little resentful as I swallow the pills. Why cant I just reason my way through the sadness? Why cant I just see the hope through the pit of despair? Why cant having it all fill the huge gaping hole? Why do I have to let myself hit the bottom before I can decide I need to stick to the plan? Why with forums like this and such a greater openness about mental health do I still feel so alone? Nothings seems worth it. I cant even bring myself to cry about it. That seems worthless too. Its getting harder to fake it and push through. Being an adult only makes me want to run and hide more. Theres always so much to do, but I cant anymore. Then I think of my little family and I feel so much guilt that I could think about leaving them. But I do, I think about my end so much it scares me.",

The question I have is, does it ever get better? Ive felt pretty much how I feel now for as long as I can remember about 10 years I dont have an awfully great memory. I only just realized that routinely thinking of suicide is not the norm but Ive wanted to die for, well as long as I can remember. I am 20 now, Im exhausted and Ive tried everything I could possibly think of but Ive really just been getting worse. Im a student and I have a really hard time keeping up with medication and therapy payments, and Ive just become completely exhausted.

I feel guilt for being a financial burden on my father, I feel shame for not moving on with my life like my peers. I hate not having friends, and being a hermit. I really dont want to move back in with my father, because he hoards, and my depression will only get worse. All I want to be is financially independent. I want to be a functioning member of society.

    "i had to say goodbye to my sweet boy today after finding out yesterday cancer is ravaging his body. maximus came home almost four years ago, after enduring years of abuse. he was a 90 pound hunk of love who thought he weighed about 5 pounds. most handsome boy youve ever seen, a pitbull with the biggest block head that i love more than anything. he always had to be by my side, and i always had to be by his. i would lay on the floor with him any chance i had, and he would always angle his head down and just collapse his body into my lap. my boy loved to get dressed up a bandana around his neck always made him sit up a little taller, and walk a little prouder. he got a rough start, having been used as a bait dog for the first half of his life. his body was permanently marked with scars from where evil scum had cut him repeatedly. when we found each other at the shelter, he had been there for 9 months and been adopted out and taken back quite a few times. ill never be able to wrap my mind around the fact no one else kept him, but im so thankful they didnt and that he waited for my family. he was missing almost all his teeth from chewing rocks, and was blind in his left eye. he has seen and experienced the worst humankind has to offer yet still had more love for us than you could ever imagine. he was my big, goofy, happy happy guy. the biggest regret i have is that i didnt get to him sooner than i did. Maximus didnt want to eat anything the past few days, and was more sluggish than usual. my mom took him to the vet yesterday just to make sure nothing was actually wrong, and they told us his red blood count was low and he needed a blood transfusion. it was serious but no reason he wont recover from it. we took him from there to emergency vet, where they ran tests and did scans. the vet said he has never seen anything like what was shown on those scans, that my sweet maximus was a very very sick little boy.",

    "Afternoon Anxiety and Depression For the past couple of months I have had really bad anxiety and depression at night. I have been dealing with both for years now, almost I think since middle school, Im 27 now. However, since August of last year, when I had my first and only anxiety attack, I was out with my friends and my anxiety got so bad that I had force them to call me an uber so I could just go home and sleep it off. I told myself and my parents that if I didnt feel better in the morning, I was going to the hospital. I never felt that bad in my life and I have been worried about it happening again. There are a lot of stressful things going on in my life right now, somethings that I think maybe life changing, but I cant be sure until the time comes and it might be sooner then later. I can elaborate if you guys want, but its a long story. I feel fine in the morning, I feel great in the morning. Im very positive and eager to get things done. It hits me around 3 or 4 pm. Something will trigger it that will cause me to think negative thoughts and it will affect me the rest of the night, but if I had that same thought at like 9 am, I would shrug it off and think, something like It not happening now, so dont worry about it. It has ruined a lot of things for me. Going out with friends is now dreadful. I used to look forward to hanging out with people, but now I would rather stay at home. My sleep schedule is going to bed as early as possible because I cant stand the anxiety. It even stops me from doing chores, I drop everything and want to sleep. It seems like ever since I had the anxiety attack, this has been happening every night. Am I subconsciously worrying about having another panic attack? What can I do to help ease my thoughts. I would love to go out with my friends again without feeling this way. I am seeing a Psychologist and taking meds at the moment. Insurance sucks, so a therapist would cost me 70 and I dont have the money for it and money is probably my biggest anxiety factor.",
    "Family crises Im 31. 9 years ago I met my wife in my small hometown in East Tennessee. I fell in love with her, but she was from Midwest Florida, and had a 3 year old son already. Soon after we met she got pregnant with my son. Growing up with a father that lived in Illinois, I knew immediately that I would do anything to be there for my unborn child. So, we decided to move to her home town in Florida where all of her family is, get married and start raising her first born and our new baby. Ive always had depression to some degree. Weve had a rough marriage almost from the start. So, weve slowly been drifting apart this whole time. On March 28th we started the day off with sex. I felt like a million bucks. As the day went on she said she was tired of being couped up in the house all week because of the Corona virus. She wanted to go to a hotel to get away I supported her decision to take some time for her self and told her she should go. Eventually she decided to not go to the hotel and instead go out with one of her girlfriends and her sister. I once again supported her decision. She left at 2pm. As I was at home with our boys playing in the pool making burgers for them and having fun I realized shed been gone for almost 6 hours. I started calling her and she wouldnt pick up, so I Facebook messaged her friend she said she was with, and asked her to have her give me a call. Her friend was surprised to say the least that I was contacting her, mainly because she wasnt with her. She finally called me around 830 after her friend contacted her to see what was going on. Caught in her lie, she immediately confessed that she had driven an hour and a half to go out on a 37 year old rich guys boat for a while. After their boat ride, they went to go get Publix subs in his 2020 Corvette. My wife works at a successful car lot, and this was one of her customers. she actually sold him the boat and the Corvette. He knows that shes married with kids. She swears they didnt do anything sexual.",
    "I'm all alone No one likes me. I am the fuck up of the family. Im the ugly fat stupid sister. All of my friends leave after 2 weeks. No one cares. I want to make another attempt on my life but I am so afraid that I will survive again. I dont want to be here I dont want to live. No one knows the real me and no one cares about me either way. My family wants nothing to do with me. I just cant hold on much longer. I want to cut myself so badly but I gave away all of my knives. I feel lost. As if I am drifting in the endless expanse of space. No one can hear me cry and choose to ignore my pain. Someone just talk to me in the comments I just need someone to be here...even just in the comments....",
    "My suicidal long-distance friend often does not respond to me for days and idk what to think about it, how can I help her? So a few months ago I befriended a girl which whom I have a connection like with no one else. Unfortunately her mental health has been declining recently, she had a suicide attempt. I am extremely worried for her, last time we talked she told me I dont have to worry for her because she doesnt have the means to commit suicide, but its still extremely worrying. I told her that I want to meet her, that I can come in a few months. I texted her everyday but since a few weeks she rarely views my messages leaving them unread, despite her being online. She says that its from anxiety and brain fog and I want to believe her, because being ignored is something I really dont like. That also of course makes me worried for her as fuck. I guess that calling her would probably be rude and will cause her discomfort? I dont know if I can do anything for her? I wanted to support her with talking to her but right now I cant even do that. I dont have any contact to her family, and contacting them would probably make her upset. She has a long distance boyfriend but he is also kinda shady as he is a source of her depression and he often ignores my messages too. Any advice wiil be appreciated",
    "It's been 3 weeks of active depression Idk how I should start off as but, Im 17 and in yr 11 I only have this year and next year to fix my stuff up with my grades. Lately Ive been feeling really depressed about my exams and my sacs School Assessed Coursework. I ended up finding that these exams this year dont count to anything and I just wasted my time falling apart over it. And Im feeling sad that Im not doing well the way I want to. I tried reaching out to my friends, talking about how I feel, they even said whenever Im depressed or feel like hurting myselfbtw with hurting myself I only did it a few times and havent done it in like a year just to come to them for help, they said that they cared but they dont. I tried this morning to reach out.... I got blocked, Im not really a person with much friends but I usually just talk to my irl friends on social media. It helps to have someone to talk to, but now I have no one. No one really cares about me or checks up on me, Im mostly talking about my friends about this, my parents sometimes check up. But I need that attention for someone to give me, without it I just feel alone and scared. Now I just feel so alone in the wide open world, idk where I see myself going in life, idk what to do, I keep taking days off from school because I feel like im gonna have another meltdown there. I cried at school and felt so embarrassed and even more sadder when people noticed and stared at me. I just feel pathetic. This whole morning Ive felt being sad and cried, now my pillow is wet with tears. Ive tried watching YouTube videos to distract myself but nothing is helping, thats why Im deciding right now to try seek help from here. Idk what to ask for but I just want some support.",
    "I need a few suggestions So I have been depressed for years now. Im 14 years old. I know that therapy is a thing I should get but I cant. I already have 3 siblings in therapy and my parents dont need another. Plus this whole covid 19 stuff. Anyway even after i cant go to my family about it because they are already stressed all the time and I cant add to it all. Plus I have a hard time talking about all my problems to other people. So I came here to ask for suggestions on what I can do for the time being to help me feel better about myself until I am able to get help. I hope Im not asking too much. Thanks in advance for any suggestion.",
    "Want go back to my life before all of this. Please help! How can I get over this obsessive fear of others opinions? It is ruining my life Im not sure if this is OCD, but I 19F have been dealing with intrusive thoughts for almost 6 months now. They are somewhat similar to POCD, but I get gruesome intrusive images of men abusing children it is never me, and I also get intrusive thoughts like what if she is being abused and what if that father is a pedophile who is abusing his child?. I think I have these thoughts because I absolutely detest and fear child sexual abuse, more than any other act in this world. The thoughts are distressing, but I have been able to use online resources and tips in order to decrease the amount of thoughts. Lately though, I have been worrying over the groinal response, which is debilitating. I could tell immediately that it was not arousal. And it usually doesnt happen at the moment of the intrusive thought, it happens while I am ruminating and when my anxiety is at its peak. I can tell that this truly doesnt mean anything because of the fact that it just happens when I am super anxious. I could be watching a tv show involving nothing sexual, and get a groinal response due to anxiety. Though, whether I am anxious about being aroused by the gore in the show, I dont know. I think one of my fears, that lines up with POCD, is that I would EVER be attracted to any form of sexual child abuse. Because I used to watch shota as a child and read inappropriate underage fanfiction, this fear has somewhat tangible evidence. Even though I was the same age as the characters, it still disturbs me. I know for a FACT that I have no interest in children, and that I never have I am attracted to men at least 5 years older then me. This groinal response has me questioning though why would I have this if I did not fear being aroused by children? . Even though this technically doesnt mean anything, does the groinal response indicate that I think I am a pedophile? It is confusing, but I guess my fear isnt that I am a pedophile because Im not.",
    "Gf won't get help because she doesn't want to change Im at a complete loss here. I 27f suffer from depression and anxiety myself. Im having trouble reaching out for help, but Im slowly building the courage and doing self help because I want to get better and be a happy person. Last night my girlfriend 28f who has been struggling for a while told me that shes in a really dark place. When I started to lead the discussion into getting help or even just a little self help, she just gave me a flat out no. Shes been suffering for years and the various meds and therapy she goes through just help her for a little while and then she goes back to depression. She says she doesnt want to be different. She doesnt want to work on being happy because then she isnt herself. Doesnt like the feel of being on meds because she isnt herself. Shes fine just accepting being depressed as her default state and one day when shes tired of living shell end it all. She doesnt want to end it now so shes not eligible to be hospitalised. But she is calm and completely certain that eventually she will kill herself. I dont know what to do with such clear and calm certainty. She struggles with similar things that I do. I try to give the answers that hope are true. whats the point of living when all we do is work and sleep to pay for a place we never use because were working or sleeping Im not worth saving nobody cares etc, but she just refutes it and stays where she is. Problem is, I leave the country in the next 6 months so weve always known our relationship has an expiry date and she has no support network. She has no family and very few friends that are in a position to help out. Shes spent quite a lot of time homeless in the past. I dont know what to do. It feels like she only wants to get better if it happens organically, but that is a rarity. TLDR gf wont get help.",
    "To everyone who actually took time to read this, thank you for caring for me, a random stranger who probably doesn't deserve getting much help anyways. While I was using my iPad, my brother in law got all in my face and pointed out how I already used my iPad for 4 hours already, so he told my sister to block my iPad so I could stop using it. I got really stressed, and I couldnt vent because I could only text on my iPad and computer which was in the living room, and I didnt want to see their faces. So I resorted to using the back of a scissor blade, and ran it back and forth on my arm with all the scabs, and I scraped off the scabs  23 layers of skin. It wasnt bleeding much, so I just cleaned it and let it dry. Then when my mom called me to go on a family walk, I flat out refused, and I started yelling at her for never understanding me, and how fucked up I always felt, and how tired I was I had cried a few times earlier and I just wanted to never see their faces for the rest of the day. Then my mom saw my arm, and she just left the room. Then around 23 minutes later, I hear my sister freaking out about my mom having a bloody nose. A few moments later, my mom started spitting out blood, and thats when we decided to bring her to the ER. On the return trip from the ER, my sister just glares at me and says how the blood was triggered due to stress, and how we were lucky it was only some blood, since she couldve gotten a stroke. My mom starts trying to explain to me that it wasnt my fault, but she just starts tearing up in the middle of it. Of course, thats the last thing me and my sister want, so we just shut up and try to comfort her before something else happens. Then at home, after I had taken a shower and was trying not to cry as I explained the whole situation to my best friends, my mom just comes out of the room with Vaseline and sash in hand. She starts binding my arm, even though I was the one who caused her to be so sick, and she acted like nothing happened and tried to comfort me as I started shaking.",

Im this close to ending it all and my therapist will just refuse to let me see the psychiatrist no matter how many times I ask. If I do attempt it will be successful, so its not like Ill have multiple attempts ie. they may give me meds after one. What do I say to get them to think more about giving me them? Theyre so reluctant. I see people complain 247 about how they dish out meds on a platter. But its the opposite for me and there is absolutely no reason.

    "How can I (28f) help my Mum (56f) who is depressed and considering suicide. My Mum has struggled with severe depression ever since her early teens. She has been on a variety of antidepressants on and off for many years and has attempted suicide to the best of my knowledge twice before. She has never kept up with therapy of any sort as she doesnt believe it works. Previously when she fell into a depressive state she would become incredibly pessimistic and irritable, withdrawn, sleep long hours  really just your average symptoms of depression. In recent times over the last 6 months her behaviour has escalated to the point where I am deeply concerned that she will attempt suicide again She doesnt socialise. She has always had a small social group but is now not even engaging in the two things she had been keeping up with for years daily gym and a monthly book club and refuses to do anything new due to the cost. She hates her job and her coworkers, but will not look for other employment because she considers herself too old to get employment elsewhere. Her hatred of her workplace has escalated to the point where she will literally just leave, without advising anyone, and go home to bed. She justifies this as they wouldnt notice me if i was there anyway. Previously she has always had an incredibly strong work ethic, she wouldnt miss a day ever! She is unwilling to stay on antidepressants for extended periods. She doesnt like that they make her gain weight 5kgs OR shes feels that they have done their job and stops taking them cold turkey. This particular behaviour has been an ongoing problem for as long as I can remember but now she wont even consider making an appointment to get a script. She is sending nasty texts and emails to her siblings and cousins, accusing them of imagined petty insults towards her and reacting disproportionately when they tell her that she is acting inappropriately and needs to seek help, she believes they are just trying to get rid of her. Previously they had a friendly but distant relationship without regular contact.",
    "Realising no one cares is a heart wrenching realisation to come to When you come to the realisation that literally no one in your life would care for more than a few days if you die, is a pretty crushing reality to come to terms with.

I wanted to get high and numb myself like I usually do when I feel like this, but I only have a little bit of thc oil in my cart left and I was saving it for fun times with friends and with her, and I didnt want to waste it so instead of doing that, I decided to write a song. So basically Ive spent the last 3 hours writing and recording a 3 minute song on guitar. I wrote it for her, about her, her pain, my pain, my love for her, and just whatever thoughts were impulsively racing through my head at the time.

    "Feeling trapped.. I feel like Im losing what bit of control I had, and its really beginning to show since Ive become unable to work in the last few weeks because of my epilepsy... Im starting to become more paranoid, Im hearing things, I wake up thinking someone is in my apartment, Im losing weight, I cant make myself get out of bed or make a phone call. Its only been a year since I was diagnosed with epilepsy and I think I seriously underestimated how much it was going to hurt my already not excellent mental health. I was hospitalized for a suicide attempt in Sept 2018, and was diagnosed with epilepsy in Oct 2018. I do my best to maintain myself, but things have been really tough. As things increase in stress, Im getting closer to a huge episode and its freaking me out. I dont know what to do with myself. My mom sent me some bullshit audiobook about selfhelp CBT, but any of my halfassed attempts to listen just wear me out or make me frustrated.

Because of this, it causes a selffulfilling prophecy as I dont make the effort to do things because I find nothing enjoyable.

    "What would be the best way to talk to my S.O. about getting help tomorrow when it's a really upsetting subject for her even though she needs it? Ok, so me and my S. O. are both 15, I am a male and she is a female if that helps at all. Recently, my S. O. has been getting worse and worse and blocking outgetting rid of anyone or anything that helps her or makes her happy and Im extremely worried about her. She took up cutting about 2 years prior, even back then I knew her and did all I could, but eventually it came down to me calling the authorities to save her when she threatened to kill herself one night and her parents sent her to a mental hospital for awhile, which yes, while it did make her stop when she got out for awhile the things she got away with and did in there are absolutely horrible and Im disgusted by the way mental hospitals go about helping their patients. So anyways, recently she picked it back up again, Id say about a month to a month and a half ago. Ive been doing everything in my power to help her stop and I got her to for like 1 maybe 2 weeks at most before an event occurred in which she got her phone taken away by her parents and started it up again because I couldnt be there for her. She also most likely has an eating disorder, I say this because one moment she is eatingsnacking just chillin, the next shes throwing it all up and going days on end without eating. Shes claimed it has nothing to do with being fat shes under 90 pounds but yet she still brings up eating like a pug or not wanting to get fat so I assume that may be her reasoning but it could be more. She tells her parents who are doing a very shit job at looking after their daughter btw that shes just not feeling well or she pretends to eat and gets away with it.",

    "I’m terrified of thinking I’m giving up, but also I feel like I’m done. Im turning 30 next year and Im the biggest fuck up I know. Ive been all my life thinking I had a great future ahead as I was a betterthanaverage student, my parents let me choose the career I wanted even if it was an economic riskIm majoring in arts, went through college very competently, got good grades but I also was inadvertently sabotaging myself. Ive been suffering from depression and anxiety since I was a teenager, my parents were told I might have a mental disorder such as an anxiety disorder or BPD. I went to a psychiatrist for a whole year but dropped out since I wasnt feeling any different and decided to instead focus on school. But being honest I never truly made an effort in school. Many professors told me I was talented but I was always so afraid to prove them wrong so I did no major projects. I kept avoiding major job opportunities since I thought those werent for me and I wasnt the right guy for them. My professional life had a shine of light at the beginning of 2020 as one of my projects was being financed, then the pandemic hit putting everything on hiatus, got no job of course, and had to go back to my parents. One year later everythings worse. Still jobless, still with my parents, procrastinating, hitting bottom every couple months, with 3 suicide attempts already, and just shitty thoughts every passing hour. My parents are sick of me even if they dont say it out loud. Im sick of myself. Im a fucking parasite too scared to do anything to change that. To move back to my apartment and find a job. To see how accomplished my friends are and seeing what theyve done in the past year and me thinking good for you mate, I just tried killing myself more than once haha. Im too ashamed. Im too old now.

Currently, Im working on my next video which will be about Depression and I could use the help of this Communitysubreddit. My background allows me to understand the science and psychology of depression but, luckily, I never have suffered from it myself though I experienced it secondhand when my mum got a major depressive episode a few years back. So I want to add to the video by infusing it with personal stories and experiences of real people who have suffered or are suffering from depression. I have 2 questions 1. What would be the single most important thing the public gets wrong about Depression. What do people who never had any experience with it dont get? 2. If anyone wants to share a story or personal experience with depression that I could incorporate in the next video anonymously without username if desired I would be honored. This is an amazing subreddit and I appreciate all your comments and feedback. Please feel free to ask me any questions. All the best to all of you!

We say dark days and on those days his mood is selfdescribed as blah. He has depression, but we dont talk about it. Its not for lack of trying on my part. I wish he could open up and tell me how hes feeling. I wish he could cry with me and tell me that well get through this as much as I tell him. My husband has depression, but we dont tell anyone about it. Wheres your husband? Is the hardest question to hear sometimes. Why didnt your husband come? He isnt feeling well, I say. We decided he needed to get some rest. We dont talk about it. It is dark. It is a cloud that hangs over our house for weeks. Sometimes, it isnt so bad. We have good days. We even have great months. Beautiful months. But it rears its ugly head and we know. We know because the house feels tight. The rooms when were together feel as though they are squeezing in. It doesnt care that I need to be touched, or that I need to touch my husband. We dont talk about it. But we do fight through. We stand back to back. Sometimes, I have to support both of us with my broken emotions and iron love, and thats okay. I know he realizes all of this, I know because in those good days and great months, Im treated as a queen. We make love and make memories and we shine. We shine so bright that I know when the dark days come, well fight them. He knows he has me somewhere in those dark, cold days, even if he cant see or hear me, he knows Im there. And I know that hes there, too, still the man I love, the hero of my fairytale. The hardest part though, the part that I wish we could change because depression isnt something that can just be fixed, I know this my husband has depression, but we dont talk about it.",

    "How will I ever know if I’m well enough for a relationship? Ive been suffering from depression for as long as I can remember and suicidal thoughts for the past 4 years they started around the time I was about to enter uni. One thing that I have always believed is that, before I even consider any sort of romatic relationship, I need to work on bettering my mental health drastically and thus gain enough emotional maturity. However, Ive failed to define how much emotionally maturity is just enough for me to start considering myself worthy of a relationship. Thanks to a supportive family, medication and plenty of therapy, Ive bettered myself far beyond what I thought I was capable of. I havent had serious suicidal thoughts in a couple of months and Ive been able to confront situations which before wouldve emotionally crippled me for weeks. I still have a lot to work on, specially in terms of social skills, but atleast I can find some joy in my day to day life. So my question is how will I ever know when Ill be mentally stable enough for me to even consider seeking a relationship? Or am I just overthinking all of this?

And I know I sound like an immature spoiled brat in saying so. How does one find the motivation or the will to fight this? I feel like giving up before actually starting the fight. It wont be worth it. I really cant see myself feeling proud, happy or satisfied about myself, or being the person I want to be. I really cant put words to my thoughts and feelings, it all sounds so banal. I know a lot of people feel like this, like no one understands me, it will not work for me, there is no help I can get . I KNOW there is help I can get, although it hasnt for me yet. I KNOW it might get better if I put the time and effort into it. I just dont want to. I want to die. But Im not allowed to and it pisses me off. Ah shit, this turned into an unstructured, pathetic rant. Just read the TLDR.",
    "I don’t know what I should do My parents have brought me to several therapists, the one Im currently at had the correct medicine for me. The two therapist I went to said I have depression and gave me medicine for more dopamine as I lack any in my mind. The latest therapist I went to said I didnt have depression, saying that I have a social anxiety disorder and gave me medicine to relax. I live in Cambodia which is somewhat poor, and from what Ive heard from here, Im not sure if I should trust them or not. I need some advice.",

    "I can’t take it anymore Hi guys, I feel like I cant take it anymore. Im 15 years old and in grade 11, I go to an all boys catholic school, which predominantly contains white students. Throughout my whole life my parents have had a extremely bad relationship. When I was born my dad bailed on my mum, brother and me only to come back after she begged him. My dad currently cheats on my Mum and has been doing it as for as long as Ive been alive. My mum is dyslexic and works very long hours, I generally only see her for about 3 hours a day. My parents hate each other and havent spoken to each other in over a year, putting me in between all their bullshit. Ever since I started highschool I was getting bullied, it started out with name calling and me being him stopped for a while and they about 6 people started hitting me together. I told two of the housemasters at my school and nothing happened. This continued and I had a panic attack at school where I spoke another teacher about the bullying and nothing happened. Last year a large amount of the bullying stopped and my life seemed to get a bit better. This year two people have been going at me every chance they can. They taken it to the point where they have created instagram accounts of me where they create memes and just mock me it has been going on for about 3 months, I only found out recently after one of my friends showed me. I cant fucking take this bullshit in my life anymore. I just want to fucking end it",
    "Struggling this morning big time I came home from vacation yesterday which wasnt that great anyway and I woke up crying my eyes out. I feel so sad and empty. I know Im just overwhelmed by the trip back and unpacking and everything but I need some support if anyone can offer. My aunt also told me that her kidney function is low in her remaining kidney she had the other removed because of cancer and thats not great news. I am tapering off Lexapro after 7 years on it and Im expecting that most of this is due to that, but its hard to convince myself in the moment. I really need a hug but I cant go to my auntshes struggling enough. I feel so alone.",
    "I am beyond Pissed of spiraling out of control and need someone to help sort me. I felt like maybe I was growing in the last 6 months. I made a group of friends I could talk to for the first time. A group that would hang out all the time have a great time and just do everything together. About 2 months in I opened up to one of them after having really bad day. They said I could always trust them and they wouldnt leave me. Here I am a few months later and they call saying that they cant come and talk to me ever when I need it. I told them I was overwhelming as a person because Im so depressed and negative and that they would want to be done and they would stop coming over when I needed help. I was told however dont worry I wont ever leave you alone but as I had expected I was right and now they are giving up. I am beyond angered and sad and frustrated that I put all of my trust 100 into this person who even has told me to open up to the rest of that group. But now the whole group has a slight fear of me because depression is scary even for people who arent actually depressed because they just dont know what to do sometimes. I am no longer treated the same by the rest of the group and the one I trusted with everything has left me in complete shambles and my mind is freaking out. I am not really sure how to deal with this stuff because I dont have much time to do things or the energy to do much for myself. Any suggestions on how to sort my head or at the very least I dont know just acknowledging that Im doomed as always would be great. Or just you know the whole yeah people suck nobody can be trusted everyone lies and nobody could ever handle the worthless person you are. Because thats what my head tells me right now.",
    "Felt like I just should die, even if I don't want to. Hello guys, It must be like three days that Im registered on Reddit sorry if I say something weird or wrong, english isnt my first language, you can correct me if there is a mistake and you feel like it, thats not a problem I hope and I was trying to give an advice to people like just an advice that I believed was good to follow if a person was in a bad situation with someone with wrong intentions someday. My point was only to help, and I never said in the comment in question that Ive got all the knowledge in the world and that my advice was an order or whatever. But yet, somebody just told me that I should not have said what I said the advice because in her case which was a very bad one, like a situation I hope nobody would live, even if I know that everyday people unfortunately experience it and I had too, but I never said that in my comment or in reply to her because I didnt have to and whatever and I felt really attacked by her. Because she made me really feel like a bad person, as if I was even coupable of what would have happen to her in the past, and she told that BECAUSE she did not do what I was giving as an advice, she lived. But if she did what I have said, she would have been dead, and she made me feel really guilty about it. The point is, that I was just trying to help and she didnt have to talk to me like that. I didnt knew where to post what I am posting right now, because for the record, Ive been depressed for more than ten years and I experienced like, almost one time a year one time could be hours, days, weeks or months of me feeling like I really should kill myself. And Im even in one of this episode for a few weeks and everyday I try to help at least one person a day. Not to feel better about myself, but because I want to help as many people as I can and I know that it could help.",
    "Am i a bitter person? And why cant I have that? Similarly i saw an INstagram couple recently who, gave birth do a daughter. Inside i burnt, i hate this couple and they dont deserve to be happy, iv had the hardest life and i have had nothing go right for me, why should these people get it ? Today i saw my cousin again after 6 weeks and I feel so angry when I look at her, and the baby. Because of my own life, iv always wanted to bring up a daughter. I know what i was missing in my life, and i guess its redemption from my bad childhood that id love to bring up my own daughter like my parents couldnt amp give them everything id wish i had. I dream of it all the time, its my biggest goal in life. Thats why when she had a daughter, i was wishing it was a boy so she wouldnt get her perfect life. If it was a boy i wouldnt be this resentful, this hatred, this angry. When i look at her amp the baby i feel angry, that WHY cant that be me? Why cant i have met my childhood sweetheart, why cant I have a lovely baby girl amp boy, why am i the type of girl nobody will marry? Everything she says about the baby i get offended, i take it as shes showing off and rubbing it in and shes got her perfect family now, shes smug Honestly i cant be happy for anyone. If i see an insta couple have a baby, i block. If i see baby girls especially being born my heart sinks inside. I even hate my own cousin now of jealousy, anger, i feel like WHY hasnt god let anyone love me, iv suffered so much in my life i deserve some love, not these guys who get everything handed to them on a plate. I want it, why should they? I deserve it for suffering my whole life and nothing ever going right. I burn with jealousy when people have a good lifemostly with couples though, when i see people in love it kills me because im dying for that. I deserve it after the hell of a life iv had.

    "I Don't Want to Talk About It I am depressed. I live a joyless life. I dont want to kill myself but I dont really see the point in living. I keep seeing ads or public service announcements with celebrities that say Do you want to talk about it? Find someone to talk to. Im here for you to talk to. My problem is that I dont want to talk about it. I am ashamed. I feel weak and incapable of solving my own problems. I feel like my life is objectively great with no real reason to feel this way. I dont want to whine, I dont want to dwell. But I do recognize that talking about it has to happen if anything is going to get better. The people close to me clearly see theres a problem and inquire. My default response is I dont want to talk about it. Or I ignore the question. Or I change the subject. How do I get over this hurdle of being able to talk about this with anyone?",

    "Everyone around me has become so political and I feel suffocated by it. Hi. I just wanted to get some stuff off my chest and maybe reach out to some people for advice on how to handle this issue. I feel like everything I see or is recommended to me across all media is something depressing and political and its like a hammer beating me over the head constantly. I honestly cant take it anymore. Whether its watching tv, browsing Reddit, at work, even hanging out with friends playing tabletop I feel trapped and that I cant escape. I just dont care and I never have nor will. Im already an easily annoyed person. Its gotten to the point where Id rather sit in my room drawing by myself or writing than interact with anyone because inevitably something politically charged will come up and more than likely make the situation awkward at best and outright hostile at worse. Even telling someone I dont care about their politics is taken as a personal attack and I get blasted for being ignorant. Its definitely hampering my willingness to interact with the world and my mental health. Tldr how do I avoid being constantly exposed to depressing negative politics and people who are so consumed by it that they throw away any sort of human dignity? I need help. P. S I imagine Ill get some advice like limit my social media usage but, to be honest, Im rarely on Twitter, I hardly ever use Reddit anymore because it always makes me sad, and Ive never had a Facebook account.",

    "Being a teenager sucks Hi, To preface this Im going to sum up myself. Im a lonely geek teenager thats an only child with no pets, like stereotype computer geek. I just got back into physical classes again after 2 years doing online ones which I preferred I just moved and am having a tough time making friends and a tough time with my parents Were in a small apartment while ours gets renovated so Im sleeping on the couch and then going to school with no privacy really. My parents always try to turn the tables on me and then make things my fault or make me do things then insult me for things Im forced to do. I got some clothes a while ago I said I didnt like and I said I didnt like the fit , so I didnt wear them, now its my fault that I asked for them or other times they just say that I have to wear stuff because they say so. It feels like every night theres a screaming match between me and my dad or my parents , my mother is always seemingly depressed or has an attitude , I dont have friends and dont know how to make any. I just really dont know what to do. Teenagers nowadays dont care about Linux or old music , all they wanna listen to is shitty rap and use fucking tiktok. When we went to my doctor I had to take an exam where I have high signs of depression and my parents were told I should see a psychologist , that never happened of course They have alcohol with breakfast, lunch, and dinner which doesnt help either and it always feels like the standards are against me and that everything I do gets judged. They treat me like they own me and like I cant speak. Because no matter what I think my mom is always more important all she does it cook and smash I swear to god I really dont know what to do. Ive tried offing myself in the past and my mom laughed at me and screamed dont be ridiculous. I tried to come out as LGBT to them and was made fun of and still am and I have to lie that Im not. It makes me so angry seeing other people in classes and knowing they have pets and siblings and loving parents , and I dont.

Him being in a low place drains me a lot, but Im constantly scared of him doing something to harm himself. In these past few days he has constantly been expressing how tired he is of living, how he doesnt think he can do it live anymore, and how he wish he was never born.

    "Boyfriend broke up with me a week after I got a shocking diagnosis, says my mood was too bad lately hi, frankly Im here to hear some motivational words. Ive been suffering from depression since I was a child, this was diagnosed by a psychiatrist. Ive been feeling better for a while. However, after I got with my boyfriend it definitely got better. Now last week I got the shocking diagnosis, that I might not be able to get pregnant naturally because of an undetected infection that I had at some point and Im going to surgery in a month due to chronic pain as consequence of this infection. Ive been really depressed, angry and frustrated lately. I just think that this could have been detected sooner, as Ive had pain in my lower abdomen for a while. On top of this, Im really stressed from university because I have to do a lot of homework and also work. My boyfriend of 2 12 months just broke up with me because he said that Ive been in a bad mood and he feels affected by this. I cant believe that he would just leave me at a time like this. Hes shown 0 empathy for my situation and always said I should stop feeling grumpy. I mean honestly. I moved out of my student housing room during the weekend to go live at my dads place during this difficult time and discovered that there is mold in my room now. I just feel like I cant catch a break and wonder how I can deal with this. Im so shocked because he always told me he loves me more than I him and that he really adores me. And now this. I mean its good that I know this now after such a short time rather than later. No one can use a partner that wont be there for them during difficult times. Im just having a hard time grasping this situation. I feel even worse now that he told me his reason for breaking up was that my mood had been too bad lately. I am afraid that I will be back to my major depression due to the course of these events. Im probably gonna phone some therapists soon so that I can deal with this situation better, as I fear that I might selfharm.",
    "Depression and anxiety in cross cultural relationships? Year round I contend with anxiety and depression, successfully medicated for around 10 years now. Each winter I battle SAD in the form of depression and anxiety, and all the fun ways in which those can manifest themselves. Work interactions and personal relationships in particular suffer my closest friends either seem not to notice or just cut me a load of slack, for which Im grateful! This past summer I began dating someone who lives in another part of the US and grew up in the Philippines. As December rolled into January I explained how this time of year often affects me and I expect even more so by working strictly from home. I also reminded her that I take prescription meds. Her response is that Americans are weak and we should just get our and walk plus spend time with others, as no one in her home country ever has to take medication. That kind of sounds like bullshit in general, and also felt very insensitive for her to have said. Is it typical for other cultures to regard Americans in such a way regarding mental illness?",

I have several diagnosed illnesses, persistent grieving disorder and pdd with frequent mdes, so thanks brain for the double depression . I am unmedicaded In that past couple months after a huge mde I never quite made it completely out and have been progressively doing worse to a point where my work performance is suffering, Ive received a couple of warnings to get my sh t together not in those exact words but close.

Like I genuinely feel like Im going to either get fired sooner or later or suddenly quit, because of my mental state. I am going to discuss with my psychiatrist medication.

But a part of me has been considering temporary disability to basically be able to figure myself out, figure out the right meds if necessary, right dosage, etc before putting myself out there to work. I feel so heavy everytime I get ready for the day like what am I going to mess up today and its making everything so much worse. My work frustration is literally dragging me down harder.

    "Hello I need some advice about this. Hello, I have been dating my girlfriend for a while now. She has been dealing with depression most of her life. She bravely decided first semester of freshman year of college of last year to go to therapy. She is also doing her best to recover from self harm. I dont know her exact severity but the college has her on a watchlist. She really wants to change but has trouble getting out of the mentality she has grown up with for so long. She has planned to take her life but from what I can gather she has postponed it. To quote her You referring me will never know Im gone if I did meaning she wouldnt tell anyone. At night when she is alone is when she feels the most depressed, to the point where sometimes she has become a nihilist and only wants her death. I understand that its all up to her to change and her suicidal tendencies dont mean she doesnt love me. Unfortunately due to our situations we became long distance partners. However, I have done what I think is good support. My questions that I have are What can I do to better support her? Is there some things that I need to say or do to better support her? Feel free to ask more to get a better gauge on the situation. Id appreciate if you guys want to discuss deeper into it though if we do, could it be through private messaging as I wouldnt want the comments to be filled with so much info.

    "I need help *TW, self harm thoughts* Hi. Im on mobile so Im sorry for any issues. Ive never even looked at this sub, I just needed to find something because I have nobody to talk to so I used the search bar. Ive never admitted any of this out loud. Ive never typed them to anybody either, just in the memo section on my phone, where I keep a diary in case I end up killing myself. Im not technically suicidal, Im not trying to find ways to kill myself. I just want something to happen to me so I can just die. Im currently on a road trip with my kids two sons, ages 3 and 1 and my parents. Were on our way back to our home state, my husband is there. I want to get out of the car to pee or something at a rest stop and get hit and die on impact, I dont want anything to happen to my parents or my kids. Ive been having thoughts like this for a long, long time while walking or driving alone. I never have them when Im with other people. I have been diagnosed with severe depression, generalized anxiety, and PTSD from childhood trauma, and have gone to a therapist and a psychiatrist. I was on an antidepressant Zoloft but had to stop as it was causing me to have stroke symptoms. I feel like none of my friends give a shit. Im aware this could be my mental illness telling me this, but I cant help it. Nobody ever asks me how Im doing, and I ask them every day. I message or call them immediately after they post a concerning status on Facebook, check on them on anniversaries of loved ones deaths, etc. Nobody asks how Im doing unless I stop replying to them for over a week which I have done twice over the last year by muting all notifications from messaging apps when Im particularly depressed and cant handle anything else. When I post in group chats about something Im done or my sons have done, I feel like somebody always has something happen right then and whatever Ive shared gets ignored. Ive stopped telling people about my life and venting, and nobody has asked. Things have been stressful at home.",

    "How do I (14 M) talk to my (Typical Indian) dad about seeing a therapist? Now I dont know if I should believe him or not. Anyways, this was just the backstory and here is whats going on now I want to see a therapist to talk about my problems but there is no therapist where I live. The closest one is like 3 hours away. One of my closest friends lives in Chandigarh Its a big city and I asked him if he could find out about any therapists there. His mom used to be a dentist so she knew some people and one of her close friends is a reputable psychologist in Fortis hospital. He told me about her and I was like Well, so can I call her and talk to her about wtf is going on with me but turns out she needs to talk to my dad first because since Im a minor I cant be diagnosed without parental consent. So this means that I will have to tell my dad that I need to see a therapist. He will ask me why and I will have to tell him about my depression, suicidal thoughts, etc. Keeping in mind how our last convo about my mental health went and our notsogood relationship, can you guys give me some advice about how to talk to him? PS He gets irritated very easily and he rarely listens to me, and even if he does he will say Im wrong since I am younger and that I never listen to him. TLDR I am a 14 yo Indian dude with a typical Indian dad. Our last convo about my mental health went not so wonderful and he told me to kill myself and how to do it, and that he doesnt give a fuck about it. I want to see a therapist for depression, suicidal thoughts, selfharming, etc. but the closest one is 3 hours away. I need parental consent for even basic diagnoses, and I have no idea how to approach my dad about this.

    "I feel lonely even though there's no need to So I 25m gotta say that mostly my life is great  I have a lot of friends online amp offline and a lot of people like me for who I am which is very important for me. However  I have always been someone who was very lacking female contact. My whole life whenever I had female friends it was something very special to me and mostly those friendships were more important to me than to them. Always wanted to have a best female friend but after years where this wish never came true I gave up on it. At the moment I mainly have contact to two of my female friends. One is my ex girlfriend and we message each other occasionally. I know that shes very busy so naturally its rare for her to message me. But when we chat then its always very fun for both of us and we have a great time. And then nothing for like 1 or 2 months. I sometimes tell her how Im very happy when she messages me and stuff and then she always insists that its so rare because she has no time. So I can kinda cope with it. Then theres another online friend who I have known for roughly two and a half years now. We once were really close and even planned to meet up once but then quarantine hit and then the plan kinda fell into the water. Somehow the contact got less and less until it started again about a year ago. Mainly when its her or my birthday we keep saying how we should get into a voice call again and play some games like we used to. But then again when I ask her later she either says yeah we should do that soon or when she says I guess it could work out tonight she does not cancel it but at the same time I cannot reach her and the next day she says stuff like Sorry didnt work out. Im a very understanding person so I can easily accept that. However when you have planned something I think it should be your duty, if you post pone it, to message that person again and make a new plan. That doesnt happen. Last time she cancelled the plan nearly two weeks ago and I havent heard from her since.",
    "No matter what I think I feel like I can't stop myself from suicide Ive spent so much time thinking about killing myself, even had dreams where I have put a gun to my head and pulled the trigger. Just every time Im thinking I drift towards thoughts of suicide. I just dont see the purpose in anything at all. Every time I try to think myself out of it I just fall back into thoughts of suicide again. Like the finishing thought behind all my thoughts is suicide and nothing else matters. I just feel like unless I kill myself Ill just be here waiting to kill myself until I finally do it. At this point Im not even sad anymore, Im just THAT tired of being alive. I have nothing to gain from continuing to live, Id rather just be at eternal peace after death over each day being wasted time after time after time again. I dont know what to do. Love is the only thing that I could imagine that could pull me away from these thoughts but then theres nobody who loves me, or understands me or wants to spend each day together. So Im just left lonely and at that Id rather have been dead.",
    "I don’t know how to get help. Ive tried therapy and it just feels so fake, its so awkward talking to someone and then paying them afterwards. It just feels like they dont really care. Im on medication but it doesnt do anything. I dont feel any different. I dont want to talk to my friends about it cause I dont want them to see me differently. I dont want to bother them with my problems cause i know they have their own problems. It just feels like theres no solution.",
    "Finally spoke to my parents about my depression. Their reaction wasn't quite what I had thought. I 20M have been living with depression for the better part of a year now. I was always afraid to tell my parents because they worry too much, and I didnt want them neglecting their own health over mine. However, the circumstances over the past few days, added with the COVID19 outbreak and the subsequent quarantine has broken me like no other, and I finally opened up to my parents about my feelings. They told me to stop being a baby and to just snap out of it. What do I do now? I have never felt so lost in my life. And this is coming from a person who hasnt had a proper social interaction in more than a year. Any help would be much appreciated. Thank you.",
    ":( friendzoned by a super nice, cute sassy geeket I like. cross posting This really cool geek babe I like oh so friend zoned me  She has a bunch of health issues, but shes easy and fun to talk to.

    "how am I supposed to live in a world like ours? So much pain. So much suffering. So much loss, for so many varied, completely unnecessary reasons. How am I supposed to enjoy a cup of coffee? When I know the suffering we have endured. I cant take myself seriously because I feel the pain, for what very very very little that is worth. How am I supposed to believe that I, me, tiny inconsequential me, is supposed to want to live amongst all of this pain and loss. How am I supposed to live knowing that Im breathing air that could be used by someone else who needs it more than me.",
    "I'm seriously considering suicide again. Im getting tired of posting here repeatedly, not because of the sub itself actually, it helped me go through tough times but because I have no one else to talk to except internet strangers. The post is long, bear with me. This might be my last post, and I want to have to get some things out of my chest. I am very tired, and havent been really feeling anything since yesterday, after I got back from Chicago, so it might be a bit messy, and just... not organized at all. But here goes Im so lonely. I want people to like me. But all I am is a waste. A waste of time, resources, and opportunities. By no means am I the unluckiest person around. I have an above average IQ 152 WISC, 149 WAIS, I have certain traits that Id like to be proud of, such as being orderly and responsible, speaking 3 languages fluently EN, ES, KR and 2 languages in the beginner level FR and ZH and know a couple of more alphabets like Cyrillic, Greek and Yiddish, and I absolutely love to learn, read, and to experience. but somehow, even with all that, I managed to be the biggest fucking trainwreck I could possibly imagine. My father locked me in dark rooms for hours when I was 3 to 5. I was diagnosed w T1D when I was 5. I was always a bit weak, underweight. I started having behavioral problems since 10, including but not limited to violent tendencies, compulsive lying, stealing I dont know if its kleptomania, I hope its not. But even if it is, wont make another difference. Just another problem on my list, etc. I was diagnosed with Night Terrors and Bipolar Depression when I was 12, 13 maybe. I have suffered from achluophobia and a mild claustrophobia, as well as some social issues. I wont label my social issues, as I havent got a clinical diagnosis like anyhting else on this list, but I think it fits more into the antisocial category than asocial or social anxiety, because of my negative and possibly misanthropist views.",

    "Everything is a Blur Hey guys, ive been suffering a lot recently regarding depression and anxiety to be honest. I just wake up feeling awful, and my days are a blur, hell i cant remember what i was doing like 5 minutes ago. It genuinely feels like ive got alzheimers at times. I just feel like all the joy has been sucked out of everything as usual. Everything blends together, my depression and anxiety are collaborating each other on their next big project Make me feel as miserable as possible! shitty idea for a youtube seriesalbum, right?. Its either, feeling utterly miserable, useless and guilty with low energy and nothing to even look forward to during the day even though i should. Plus, i feel like ive lived a thousand years already and im just beginning to hate the world if im honest with how people are. Or its my health anxiety  Regular ol plain anxiety, with panic attacks, thinking im dying constantly even when im not having a panic attack. Whether or not its one of the two is all up to the wheel of misfortune that i spin most days, sometimes to keep things fresh and exciting it can be both at the same time! ampx200B Anyway, im looking for some support or some advice on what to do.

    "Feeling helpless, stuck, and confused I dont understand why Im so depressed all the time, like I just cant cope with what I have to deal with. Im on multiple medications and Im trying so hard to get a therapist but where I live you need parental consent, and Im not in public school because of my disorders so I cant get a school counsellor, and Im so scared of counselling now because one wrong word, one accidental confession and theyll lock me up in a psych ward again and that was the hardest, most embarrassing, and most traumatic experience Ive ever had, that I now have diagnosed PTSD from it. I just dont understand why Im like this, like I want to be normal and happy and go to school and go out with friends and get a job and a boyfriend and be productive and enjoy life and I try so so so so hard but its never enough, I never feel any better. I feel like Im gonna be like this forever. I just want a normal brain, without any mental illnesses and trauma. This is so debilitating I cant even function on a normal level. Im five steps behind everyone around me. Theyre graduating and I cant get out of bed to do my schoolwork I get from an alternative school, because eventually I have to hand it in and then take a test in an area of complete strangers for the entire day, doing nothing after the test, and sitting there for the rest of the day because no one can pick me up and I have no way to get home until my mom gets off work, 3 hours after the school is closed. The amount of anxiety that situation gives me makes me sick. I want to do it, I want to get my schooling done and graduate but it takes so much to bring me to even have a sliver of confidence to even consider going. Not to mention, my family makes fun of me for it and always makes jokes about Well, thats because your sister actually graduated Not until you graduate Well it gives me anxiety when you dont do your schoolwork Being said by someone who has never experienced even the slightest bit of an anxiety disorder. Ive tried to explain why doing basic tasks is so hard for me but its hard to explain something to someone who will never get it and just label you as lazy.",

    "13 years old. Wanna die Hello Reddit. This is my first post. I have read some post of other people here so I think I want to share my thoughts so that I can get help and your options on how can I be better. First off I live in Hong Kong. I have been studying for a while. I am now having a never important exam that I need to have soon. I have been studying for 247 but never get any results. I dont like studying. But out of studying. I have no hobbies and friends. I am not good at sport and art or even music. I can just study. I need to improve myself. But I cant. I get that being top 5 in my grade is nice. However I can never feel happy. I hate my teachers. They always force us to do the work in their ways. I wanted to die. I cant find the meaning of life. I cant find joy. I wanted to die. Every thing I have done is trash. I cannot find anything that will make me happy. I tried talking to my parents. However no one cares. They just said oh. And that is all. I really needed help but I cannot find anyone that cares. All my classmate are depressed and wanted to suicide. I need help. I will update soon. Thanks I got to study bye Reddit.",
    "Does anyone else feel like they deserve to feel depression and feel shitty all the time? Im just curious if this is a normal feeling. I might have options to get out of my depression, like certain pills, maybe PMS pills antidepressants seem to never work but my depression gets 10 times worse around my period and maybe counseling would work. Maybe these things would work if I tried them again even if they havent in the past, but for two reasons I haventbesides cost. First I dont think theyd work or the side effects to meds wouldnt be worth it. But second and perhaps more important idk that I want to get better, I feel like I should live with all the shitty feelings and guilt, like I have to or deserve to. I dont do it for attention, maybe once in my life when I was much more lost, when all this depression started to get bad, but not anymore, I barely even talk about my depression to anyone anymore. Is this normal? Or common? To feel like you deserve misery? Or am I actually just being an attention whore throwing a pity party for herself or something stupid like that? I dont want to be that.",
    "Depression, anxiety and panic disorder(IBS as a bonus), dont know for how long i can take this shit. So i am 22, been anxious and depressed for many years but somehow managed to survive school, but after 11 months of working IBS hit me hard. Had to stop working because i just couldnt leave the house. That was almost 2 years ago, now i still cant leave house without taking good amount of benzos, i am non stop depressed and anxious and thanks to the IBS i have developed a panic disorder. I have tried everything that doctors could think of for the IBS itself but no luck. And for the mental problems, i have tried taking three types of SSRIs, SNRI, TCA and antipsychoticsin special dose to act like antianxiety meds and every one of them made me feel worse, one of them totaly broke me for two weeks. Tried therapy for months. And have been hospitalized for 10 days at psychiatric unit and left because i felt much worse there. So i thought i just need more time to fight this, so i tried get money from the states safety net for living with disability. They acknowledged that i cant function and cant have social life but told me that i can work just fine, so big fuck you to my face 34 of income taxes really pays off.... Now i got work that i can do from home but cant really do it, i have no motivation, no joy from learning it or finishing a project only stress from the huge struggle and probably going to lose the job in a few days. I just dont know what to do, feeling worse than ever, going to be jobless. Should i try another antidepressants even thought i am scared because of the previous bad side effects? I am really desperate. Any advice is really appreciated.",

    "HS ruined my life HS was the start of several problems to my mental health, stress, anxiety, social problems and bad grades with it too as a consequence... Everything started back on the 31st of October of last year when we were having a party in our class because of Halloween, then two bullies entered the classroom, and basically changed my life. There was a bully episode that day, and was the consequence of me changing the section of the class, which means changing classmates and teachers. I made the right choice as I was constantly harrassed by the old classmated and the teachers were bad, like, really bad. So I changed the section, and I thought everything was back to normal. I was wrong. I find it hard to even study now. I cant force myself into doing nothing. Literally nothing. There is nothing I can do even to go to school. Its really fucking hard. I failed my mom. I failed everyone and what I wanted to be. I find myself in the situation where I cry a lot thinking about this. I am a failure. My mom had faith in me. There is still people that love me. My grandparents, my mom, everyone in my family. Except I havent talked about it to any one of them. I think it would be embarrassing because they cant understand what its like to be like this. I expect an answer like youre too young. And they are almost right, except depression can be found at any age. Im having a mental breakdown, seriously. As I said before, I struggle when I want to force myself into doing things, like homework or just study. I just want to end it right now. The only thing that makes me sad about it is what my family will think about. It not gonna be their fault. I even failed them. They were never strict with me, always there to love me. But now everything has changed, Im a disappoint to them even though I dont know it already. They know nothing about my mental state. Its hard guys. Life is hard. And meaningless.

    "No appetite, suggestions? Hiii and thanks in advance for any advice here. I struggle even wanting to talk about it because my family members are all I have, and they all 3 have binge eating habits. I feel guilty about it so please be gentle with me. About 4 or 5 years ago when my mental health started taking a nose dive I noticed I started losing my appetite. I started to fluctuate around 2030 lbs throughout these years. I have no trouble continuing to drink. Ive mentioned it to my doctors but they have never elaborated on it with me, and I have had blood drawn a few times, making it seem like its not as much of a problem. But its getting worse, no matter what food I prepare or go pick up I can only eat a few bites before I cant even chew it anymore and have to put it away. And I only do that 12 times a day. Its really starting to get to me. Does anyone here also go through this? Ive thought about some kind of protein drink for when Im on the brink of passing out.

Ive been going to therapy for a while now and Im currently taking medication I see both a psychiatrist and a psychologist, but it seems like nothing is changing. In fact, things actually seem to be getting worse. My psychologist is very kind and smart, but she doesnt know what to do with me anymore. I have things I know I have to work through, but Im not able to talk about them, most of the time because I am ashamed and fear the judgement, even though I am aware that she is a professional and is there to help. I keep withholding information from her. So Ive been thinking about trying online therapy. Just writing down my thoughts and sharing them with a professional I dont have to face.

    "I think I have genuine depression. I was hit by a drunk driver in November. I got some bruises, shock, and my car was deemed total loss, but it still works just fine thankfully. Since my accident, I went for a run in a violent snowstorm in St. Louis, slipped and fell on my back and hit the back of my head on the ground. It hurt a bit but I continued running. The knots on my head healed up eventually. Ive seen like 5 different accident scenes around the areas since my accident back on 1122. These past like 5 days, Ive felt incredibly emotionally unsettled. Im not in control of my emotions, and I feel so emotional inside my head, I cant speak that well. Today I feel is the worst because Im extremely emotionally unstable, I feel out of control of my emotions, and just powerfully depressed. Ive noticed Ive been waking up around 6630AM or so every morning even though I want to sleep more and refresh my mind, brain chemistry. Im going to Finland in a week or so, for a week or so. People have been cold and rude to me in public recently as well, as well as over the phone unfortunately. Ive been trying to keep marching on, but I dont feel interested, lively, confident, and vibrant like I usually do. Do you think this is depression genuinely or something else medically? Tell me your thoughts and thank you for listening and for your concern and human empathy. I care about you and your feelings too. I do hope you have a wonderful happy new year for yourselves. .",

Dont know what to do, but I dont wanna live like this anymore. I had to come back to my parents house, Im almost flunking out of college and it feels like everything is falling apart. How can I leave this terrible place?",
    "how do i deal with no appetite? i never have any appetite for the past few years and yet i gained so much weight. i hate all the food we have even though i used to love it. im just laying here with a migraine now bc i didnt have enough food and yet everything is so unappetizing to me. i know this is going to lead to too much hunger and binging later. how do i help my appetite? and please, serious answers only. this is a real problem for me, dont tell me to do drugs.",
    "How do I feel less tired? So I need some help with my motivation, and basically even though Im able to force myself out of bed and get up, I still cant find the motivationenergy to do stuff brushing my teeth in the morning, doing my work etc. Currently the only way Ive gotten the motivation to do anything is by chugging a can of monster I need 2 cans a day usually and I heard its pretty bad for the body. I was wondering if you guys knew any better ways to do so?",
    "depressed I dont know why, but im feeling depressed, I tried to kill myself sometimes, but I never make it... Why im feeling like that? I searched for help, I even went to a psychologist, but he did just say you can leave now., it was kinda of rude, i barely said why I was there... I dont have support by my family, they dont really care, my friends too... They think thats is just a joke or a drama. Im feeling tired of life, i dont have any motivations, life, at least for me, have completely lost it meaning, Im feeling like Im slowlely dying... I tried a lot of things to avoid the emptiness, i tried gym, games, books, studying, hobbies, I tried to change myself too, but it didnt work. I dont know how to say everthing that I feel.. is it wrong for me to hate myself?",
    "Do you fall out of love when you're depressed? Please. Anyone. My boyfriend and I had been together for 7 months. He first mentioned he was struggling in January with depression and needed to figure it out but had never felt that way before. We were still happy and talking all the time but I could feel him distancing himself still but he wasnt emotionally just physically. Then coronavirus hit... I saw him right before he went back to work in the beginning of it all, he had taken a vacation for 3 weeks when it was starting. After that last time I saw him, it wasnt for another week and a half until I saw him again and he was totally different. He was irritable, quiet, just NOT himself at all. During the time I didnt see him he hadnt seen his children either and it broke him. He broke up with me a week later when I saw he had basically broken down and mentioned he should get some help because he was different and suffering horribly. He said he needed to get better and it wouldnt be fair to me to wait. 2 weeks after ending things I asked if he still loved me and he said he didnt. He cut off all emotion from me. This whole time Id been trying to help him, was supportive, gave him sites to read up on it, got him to tell his mother, and also got him to reach out to a therapist through the fire department. My question is...did the depression make him stop loving me? Did he actually stop loving me or is it masked by his depression? Will he come back? Im drowning in despair and want the man of my dreams back. What do I do? Each time Ive seen him since that last day before he ended things he has been shutting off more and more...and eventually wouldnt see me anymore. Please someone help. I dont know what to do anymore for him. Or even know if he really just doesnt love me.",
    "How do I stop myself from relapsing? Im posting this here because I asked this same thing in the rmentalhealth subreddit and no one answered so maybe you guys can help Ive been struggling with depression and anxiety for almost all my life, but these past few months had been especially hard. When I go through these depressive episodes I tend to procrastinate a lot, I dont have the energy to clean my house or do my work. And this is obviously making me have consequences at my job, Im scared Im gonna get fired, all of this is just making me feel worse. So I started seeing a therapist who has been helping a lot, but she told me it was normal to relapse and that recovery is not linear, I started working better and I cleaned everything. My routine went back to normal for a couple of weeks, but since two days ago Im going through another depressive episode, and again, I dont have the energy to do anything, I havent been able to work at all. What can I do about this? Do you have any advice for me? I dont mind mentally relapsing and feeling sad, I can deal with that, but I need to keep my life going and keep my routines intact or at least functional.",
    "Why can't I talk to others about my anxieties, depression and other mental issues without breaking down into tears? Whether it be friends, parents or anyone else, I just cant talk about my own issues without breaking down. This then causes me to think even less of myself in the process and as usual I just bottle it all up. Even if I were to get psychologist help, I am certain that it would go nowhere and I would look like an utter idiot. Does anyone have any similar experience andor suggestions?",
    "Trapped in my thoughts Im stuck in my own depressed thoughts to the point where I cant sleep. I was so happy today at work, I had a conversation with the cute new guy, I had conversations with customers. The only bad thing that happened to me today was my annoying manager but shes annoying everyday. As soon as I got home I started to get stuck in my thoughts again. The people I thought were friends dont hang out with me anymore. Im anti social, alone and have no one to talk to. I want to get into a relationship but all I do is cry all the time, nobody wants a depressing crybaby. Even my grades are dropping not because I cant understand the material but because my bedroom is a dark unproductive place. I just sit here and cry all the time, Im even crying right now. But I have no one to talk to or no where to go. I cant stay after school and I dont know how to make friends. Even if I did they would leave me because Im always depressed. I need help.",
    "Trying to figure out \"why\"? Im 23, male, born and raised in a middle class family in a first world country. No serious traumas Im aware of, only thing I can think of is not having an emotionally available father. Thats about all I have to complain about. Family history  both my parents and lots of cousins are on depression medication. I was on it for around a year until I tapered off. I grew up with no reason to be depressed but from around age 1213 to now 10 years I have been getting more depressed, anxiety and anhedonia. What went wrong in my brain during my developmental years? Is this purely hereditary? Was I destined to be depressed due to some predisposition from my parents genetics? Its so frustrating I want to give up.

    "I'm an asshole and I don't know how to fix it Recently I made a post on AITA am I the asshole. PLEASE do not go there and tell me things just because you want me to feel better. The sub decided that Im a major asshole, and thats the fair ruling. Multiple times Ive been called rude, mean, even lacking in empathy. I hate myself for it. I dont want to be like this. I want to be a good person. But I cant because I dont understand how. I have autism. I see the world much differently than everyone else. I have no idea why people do the things they do, and I dont think Ill ever understand it. Theyll tell at me for my behavior and I never understand why what Im doing is wrong, even when I explain myself. The AITA post kind of broke the camels back for me. I posted because I just wanted to make sure that I wasnt being mean, and... well, I was. Bigtime. People were telling me I was an asshole to the bone, ungrateful, manipulative, etc. One person said Douche alert! with red siren emojis. Another said that Id lose all of my friends. Im a monster and Im not even aware of it. Even after reading all the replies, I still cant understand why Im so mean. But I am. Honestly, Im just considering suicide at this point. I cant function in the world, so why should I even be here? I dont know how to get better. My brain is wired wrong and Ill always think the way I do. Would anything help? Should I just die? Id rather kill myself than be any more of a horrible person... please help me...",
    "Im 14 and i already managed to fail my life hi guys, this is my first post on Reddit. I am only 14 years old. Ive been suffering from depression ever since i was 12. I rarely feel happy anymore. Unfortunately these intense feelings have lead me onto a path of constant drug use which only makes my depression worse because I know i am smarter than that. I started smoking weed 2 years ago and obviously things have only gone downhill from then. I am literally mentally and physically addicted to a fucking USB Juul and Ive even found myself robbing weed dealers just because I thought that would make me feel sick but it only made things worse. I have been taking escitalopram since I was 11. Ever since I wet to high school I did a lot of stupid shit and now that I look back at it i purely did those things because of peer approval. These couple of years have literally felt like a lagging game. I havent smoked in a day and I feel like complete shit. Theres probably a lot of things I left out because when i dont smoke for extended periods I feel dumb and slow. I made a Reddit account just to post this so please dont come at me with some bullshit jokes. I feel like ending my life my family is fighting as im writing this. Even typing a paragraph as simple as this feels mentally challenging. In elementary school my teachers would constantly say how smart i was and I would get 80s and 90s without studying and now I feel like because of the effect weed had on my brain I wont be able to find a career later on in life. PLEASE SOMEONE GIVE ME SOME ADVICE",
    "I feel so sad today I 25m was trying to do the homework my therapist gave me last week. All I had to was look, not apply just look, at different jobs I think might be qualified for. I agreed to this and was looking forward to it. After 5 minutes of looking I started to feel hopelessly overwhelmed. Ive been out of work for a year and a half now, and my BA and MA arent very useful in terms of finding a job. I dont have many practical skills or much relevant experience outside of retail and being a TA. Im going to keep trying to do the homework but I dont think I can keep going past this week.

    "Struggling with health services, would like some advice (23F) For the first time in years after being the support for my other half who has struggled with anxiety and depression, I find myself on the other side of the fence. I have been trying for over a month now to make an appointment with my GP, I have tried calling my local Adult Mental Health Services only to be bluntly told that I have the wrong number I didnt, I live in the county they are responsible for and then hung up on. I then tried calling the nonemergency number for health services and was briefly assessed and told to get to the hospital within the hour to meet a liaison for adult mental health. The liaison spoke to me for a while and she was very comforting and listened to me, and then gave me a leaflet and said to keep trying to ring my GP. I am at the end of my tether  I work very erratic shifts, sometimes early work and sometimes I finish at 2 or 3 AM making it difficult to ring the GP at 8AM to make an appointment. This has been happening for weeks now and Im getting desperate. I just want to get my health sorted so that I can look after my other half. Is there anything else I can try or do I continue to try the GP for the next few weeks?",

    "I’m lonely and depressed Then we were sent home. My friend and I who happened to be on two flights took some edibles before. We had to leave at 330, so we didnt bother sleeping before we went to the airport. These edibles hit HARD. Once I got to the gate wed be waiting at, I was paranoid. There was people around. These people might have COVID19. The seat Im sitting on might have COVID19. I cant escape it. It is everywhere. Whenever I heard someone cough, it felt like an impending bioweapon. But I was trapped in this airport and couldnt avoid it. I had a minipanic attack in the washroom. I got on the flight, and it was surreal. I hasnt really processed things yet. But I started to drift off to sleep, and saw myself at the house we were staying, with everyone in my volunteer group around. Then I woke up. And the whole world came rushing into me. I was on a flight. I was leaving. I was going home. I might not see some of those people ever again. My volunteer program experience was now in the past, and I couldnt change that. I wanted to cry. Its not like I even really LIKED everyone in my group. But after spending almost three months living with them, I was still attached to them. And it was hard to leave that behind. After a blurry 14 hours, I finally got to my home airport. My parents met me there and picked me up. I told them how things went, but its impossible to really communicate my experience. I got home, but realized I wasnt really home. Things were different. Society has morphed into a nightmarelike dystopia. Im not even allowed to see all my friends. How has the world changed so quickly? I was able to go out and see two of my friends. We played basketball, and it was pretty fun. I told them about how my trip was, and shared a few stories. But it was weird.",
    "Low-functioning Depression &amp; Exercise Ive struggled with depression for quite a while now, and certain times I find motivation comes easier than others. However, for the past three months I have been at a very low point, I shower once a week and I struggle to brush my teeth and hair. Thats where Im at. Last July I started seeing a personal trainer for the goal of weight loss and I havent seen her for 6 weeks now. My mom is encouraging me to go back, for my mental healths sake, but right now I have no interest in exercise. Also, I fear that if I go back my goal of weight loss will prioritize over my goal of benefiting my mental health. I know I inevitably kick myself for not going back, but the dread is over powering my rationale. I would prefer to just to 10 minute workouts on my own in my pyjamas, but I know I probably wont. Personal training just seems like a lot. What should I do? If you have been or know someone who is lowfunctioning, has personal training been helpful? Or exercise in general? Is it better to start small when youre low functioning or just throw yourself in? I appreciate any thoughts and advice as really I only have my moms perspective right now and she doesnt totally understand the depressed brain. Thank you",

    "Does anyone else feel like the world is incredibly dark? Ive never been treated nicely by anyone. Even the kids that are more rejected by other kids are mean to me. Ive never been mean to a single person in my life but i get treated like shit constantly. I dont know why but when I was a kid I imagined the world was a place full of empathy but literally every single person Ive met has been an unempathetic piece of shit. Im in a friend group thats so toxic it led one of the kids in our friend group to a suicide attempt with a gun but it ended up missing his brain I imagine he got scaredd and moved it at the last second. And even AFTER he attempted and was in the hospital they continued to treat him like shit and told him he shouldve just gone through with it. Dont worry, they also treat me like shit, Im in a similar position to him and I cant leave because I have no other friends. Not only that, but I treat the guy that attempted suicide with absolute kindness, Ive never been mean to him which youd expect him to be thankful for right? Nope, he actually treats me like shit more than the other kids and he even fought me a month ago simply because he hates me that much. And its not like I have a bad personality, Im extremely funny in groups of people, like its not uncommon for me to have people tearing up cause they laugh so much, but everyone still hates me and treats me like dirt. Im not exaggerating here, but when I imagine the world outside my bedroom I genuinely imagine darkness and madness everywhere.

    "Need help figuring out alternative reasons why I'm experiencing excessive sleep, extreme tiredness, low energy, no motivation but stable mood More recently  Started taking 50 mg Zoloft sertraline while weening off of Viibryd vilazodone in midApril. Have been taking lamictal lamotrigine almost as long as Ive taking medication for depression  Ive been wanting to get off of it for years but I either havent been consistently stable enough or it was not a good time due to school or work  finally started tapering off today To the point Throughout the past month, aforementioned symptoms have been worsening excessive sleep, extreme tiredness, low energy, no motivation. No matter the amount of sleep I get 4hrs, 6hrs, 8hrs, 10hrs, 20hrs I feel overwhelmingly exhausted when I wake up. Any energy or motivation I have seems erratic and is dwindling. Motivation is very upanddown but progressively more down. My depression has always been heavily tied to excessive sleep and lethargy. These symptoms are definitely nothing new to me, HOWEVER, its always been accompanied by very low moods. At this time my mood is decently stable and thats the baffling pay. I wouldnt say Im the happiest Ive ever been but Im stable. Instinctively I assumed it was a med problem since my symptoms are indicative but my Dr isnt entirely convinced thats the case since my mood is stable. She didnt up my Zoloft but we finally decided to taper off lamotrigine. She doesnt really know whats causing the excessive sleep and exhaustion. She mentioned that its possible the Vyvanse is negatively contributing even though its pretty much the only reason I can stay awake all day. She suggested there might be something else medically wrong. As luck would have it, I see my primary Dr tomorrow for my yearly exam so she told me to bring it up. Ive had my thyroid tested twice, the last time was a year ago and that checked out fine both times. I dont recall getting treated for anemia ever so maybe its that? Any other ideas? Id like to get a better idea before I go to the Dr.",

Usually its when someone starts talking in depth about sex and relationships, and the magic surrounding it. Its therapeutic and part of myself thinks I should be punished. I guess I cant really express my emotions either because people will find it too dramatic and silly, as I have been told before. No one takes my emotions seriously. Im too afraid to cut my wrists and the endorphin rush from the punches feels so good afterwards, but it hurts and my face swells up. I make sure not to hit my jaw. I feel like its the only way I can calm down. Everything feels so smooth after Im done. Ill only do this every so often though, its not consistent but I think I might start doing it again.

    "My depression has been so bad, no one has tried to contact me for months to check up and it tears me apart Everytime Ive felt that my relationship with a person is stable and we connect and have known eachother for years, I get proven wrong. I now naturally feel intense instibility in friendships, or seeking out friendships in general, because I now expect people to already have a circle of close friends, and I cant be apart of that. And it keeps happening, even online mutual friends have not reached out to me despite seeing my personal posts and how much of a hard time Ive been having this year. Even me disappearing for months did nothing. I feel intensely stupid and selfish, while at the same time feeling like if I had killed myself during these months of such bad depression, life would resume and no one would know. I feel stupid and selfish because I absolutely know its not peoples responsibility to worry about me, especially when they are living their lives and are probably going through their own issues, and I shouldnt be throwing my frustration and bitterness on people. But it feels Ive been just left in the dark while online mutuals who have known me for years, continue to enjoy their interactions with eachother and pretend nothing is happening unless they want to engage in a post thats not a personal one. Theres a lot of different issues in my life which have contributed to my diagnosis of depression and anxiety, but this year it feels like God wants to keep telling me no one cares for you. Til this day I dont know how people make lifelong friendships with people you have so much history and connection with. Maybe because of my own insecurities and outlook on friendships, Im simply expecting something that normally isnt how it works. I just feel so suffocated whenever Im online, its like I want to scream at everyone and say LOOK AT ME PLEASE, IM SUFFERING RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU, I THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS and for never paying attention when I suffered so much and continue to suffer, but want to interact with me on posts that are not about my personal mental health.

Hello, Ive 22F struggled with my mental health since I was young, I was bullied when I was a kid and developed social anxiety because of it. Then I became depressed in my teenage years, but got better when I was 20. Ive never been good at interacting with people, due to my anxiety I find it really hard to talk spontaneously to people, but at the same time I can get defensive over anything, like I feel people are attacking me or trying to make fun of me but in reality theyre just joking around. A lot of people dont like me because of that, I seem really mean but Im not, I wish I could be friends with people like a normal person but I just cant. Lately Ive been having good days and bad days, but exaggerated. When Im having a good day I feel amazing, Im productive and do a lot of things. But in my bad days I feel way too bad, I was clean from self harm for 4 years and I did it again like a week ago. When I feel bad I also cant stop thinking I want to die, I feel like no one will ever like me, Ill never get a job because I run away from good opportunities because of my anxiety.

    "You Every day I wake up and think of you. I wake up and find myself further and further away from you. The summer mornings feel colder, and no blankets but your jackets could keep me warm. The mornings youd send me a text to check up on me gave me a warmth that no family could fill. The scent of your cologne and the grass beneath us both as I watch you close your eyes, the sun glinting off your hair like copper, and when you smiled. It was like the sunrise after months of night. You. You are the reason I feel. You are the reason the sun rises on the moon. You are the reason pictures start to dance. You are the reason things make sense. Or, were, I guess. I still remember all those times wed lay in the grass listening to songs, songs that I cant listen to anymore, because they remind me too much of you. I remember trying to fall asleep on your shoulder because id only slept five hours that night, again. I remember all the concerned messages from you because you hadnt seen me at breakfast when Id slept in. The times in class when youd just hug me and watch me take things apart, and whisper compliments in my ear. When youd remind me to drink water, again, because I was being an idiot and getting dehydrated. It was... the best I think Ive ever been. Then camp ended, we video called almost every night. I was so happy, but... were you? You started playing games every night, trying to escape everything because I was making you worried, and eventually the worry and pain overtook you and you left. you left. So you do you, Ill live my life, we can ignore each other, pretend the other person doesnt exist, but deep down we both know it wasnt supposed to end like this.",
    "Feeling helpless, stuck, and confused Ive tried to explain why doing basic tasks is so hard for me but its hard to explain something to someone who will never get it and just label you as lazy. And whenever I try to explain how I feel, Im having a meltdown and being selfish and you just need your meds right now. It just feels as if my feelings and professionally diagnosed mental illnesses are being brushed off and not taken seriously. Ive had multiple attempts and for a week or so after an attempt, everyone suddenly cares and supports me but then it quickly wears off, and If it was really that bad you wouldve actually killed yourself, or You need to start making a real effort this time. I have no support systems or people I can talk to and the only reason I havent succeeded is because I cant leave my dog. Ive had her since the day she was born and people call her the dog version of me. Were so insanely close people are shocked by how mentally connected we are, and she gets upset when Im not with her. Were two halves of a whole and shes saved my life multiple times so i cant just abandon her like that, I love her with all my heart. So I guess what Im saying is I feel insanely stuck in my situation right now. Im a minor, no job, no license to be able to transport myself to get a job, no support system, no one to talk to who completely understands, no therapy access. I just feel like a hopeless cause because what could someone even do in this situation? My mom constantly gets mad at me for having anxiety attacks and I feel like Im just a burden to her, because shes the one who has to pick up my medications, etc. and she is always yelling at me because she has to take the responsibility of having a kid with a mental illness, and she wont do any research on my illnesses or how to manage a kid dealing with them even though Ive asked her many many times to. I just feel completely alone and helpless, and no where to go, and Im always terrified of asking for help or support because I dont want to be a burden to them as well or seem selfish or Im asking for pity.",
    "I'm losing my mind and need help. I contemplate suicide everyday. I don't see any future anymore, just think I'll kill myself one of these days. Everything makes me irritated, or break down. Noise seemed to be the problem. Voices make me go mad, but even when Im alone and in silence I keep thinking about everything needing to shut up. The chatter is all inside my head, and it never stops. ampx200B I feel like sometimes I am already dead on the inside, and Im not really human. Just a shell o what I wanted to be. I started going out to partys and things, mostly just filling myself with alcohol, or Ill just drive around going as fast as I can. Hoping Ill be something else, hoping Ill feel. Ive had one relationship with a girl, that eventually ended. I loved her but after that I couldnt feel anything for anyone and no, not even her. I just ended up obsessing over her, even if I didnt feel a thing. Really tried after I started to get over her, and even tried with another girl, but even with all that I managed to bosses with her as well, and got called a creep and that I harassed her. The meds make me worse off. My sex drive is completely dead. ampx200B By the end of high school I have made some friends, but I end up isolating myself, and losing them. Im starting college in August, and Ill move to another city for that, but I fear that will only isolate me, and make me worse. I think that if I dont kill myself soon, Ill do it then. I see no real future past a certain point. I fear itll all colapse, and Ill truly break down. I fear Ill lose interest in my career, since it has already happened. I was going to study astrophysics, but after an episode I saw nothing in that. ampx200B Im going crazy, always suffering. Everyday is pain, and I just want it to end. I am sick.",

I have only just started getting paid reguarly in October 2018 and I have been working for them since June 2017. I need therapy.

I feel numb and going through the motions. My family is Christian and all my life, they have had more faith in prayer, but I need real help. I want to sign up for Betterhelp in the future. Does anyone trust BetterHelp? Also while I am set and preparing on leaving, what should I do to calm my guilt. While they seem sincere now, I have seen them get very nasty.

    "Can depression cause a bad memory? When I was a young teenager I was diagnosed with depression and an anxiety disorder. My entire teenage years were dedicated to getting better and school  friends were not my priority. I still had friends, but I didnt see them as much as most people see their friends. I went to a clinic to treat my suicidal thoughts and anxiety, so I missed out on a year of school. I finally got better when I was 18, but now I am in my twenties and Im realising that I barely have any memories from that time. I do have some clear memories, but most are related to my depression, but I can almost never remember any fun stories my friends bring up, that I was apparently involved in. Its 67 years of a weird blur. I keep seeing people posting pictures of themselves as teenagers, and talking about how crazy that time was and how much fun they had in high school. Their first job, their first boyfriend, their first drink. I am glad I got to the point where I am doing a lot better. But I do feel like a I missed out on a huge part of childhood, and dont have great social skills because of it. I was wondering if its normal to have a vague memory of such a huge chunk of your life, and if depression could be to blame? English isnt my native language, sorry for any mistakes",
    "Why do I feel so shitty Yeah I post here like everyday, I cant get myself to do any of the things I say Ill do. I feel like Ive done everything I could do at this point, so why do I feel so shitty? I feel so tired and emptyheaded even though I really need to start on a paper for school. I just cant make myself get up to do it, I feel like I cant even start bc I am so weighed down by my own thoughts. I feel ugly, useless and I wish I could just get over that, learn to accept it in the back of my mind as something I cant change so I could actually do shit. I dont know what else I can do. Going to try to email my dr tomorrow, but I guess I wont if I dont get a good start on this paper bc Im spending so much money on college, literally cant afford to not do my best or get a shitty grade. I eat healthy everyday, try to lose weight but of course its very slow, but I just feel like I just sit around and rot and I dont know how to get out of that.

    "I don’t know how to maintain my relationships I think I used to be close to people and I dont feel that way anymore. I have friends but I know I put up a lot of walls and I dont know how to stop. Im scared when hanging out with people because I feel like I could mess up at any second. I invite people out and go to things Im invited to but I think my interactions are wrong. My friends have started to point out that Im not as present, and its hurting their feelings. Some have completely stopped reaching out. I want to be a good friend but I dont know what or how to change. Has anyone made their relationships better while depressed?

    "No longer actively depressed but now I need help beating the apathy. I think my life has been changed forever by the major depressive episode I had last year. I dont think Ill ever feel quite like that again I hope, but its left me a parting gift. I just dont care about most things anymore. This is positive in some ways  it makes me less of a perfectionist for example good enough is fine and I dont get choked up on the little things as much. However, it is also very very negative in other ways. I will go for several weeks without doing my laundry, wait until the last second to do assignments, wont clean, etc. I have NO sense of urgency or shame, particularly urgency, but still have minor guilt after the fact if someone comments on my slobbishness. Like, if someone was coming over and I had an hour to clean I wouldnt get everything done. Id probably pick up a few things and say Im sorry for the mess and feel guilty afterwards that Im a slob. But it wouldnt make me change, however and that annoys me. I know that I do care that these things are happening, but theres a total disconnect from actually caring enough to do them respectably. For example, I would like to clean my room because I enjoy the look and space of a clean room. I know it makes me feel accomplished when I do. But a bigger part of my brain doesnt mind living in squalor because it is so apathetic to everything. I dont like this about myself. I want to be timely and disciplined but I have a hard time caring and almost 0 motivation though its slowly creeping back in occasionally. I feel this may be a discipline issue but I would also like some sense of motivation or ambition. I get like this with my career goals too. I want to want more for myself, but I dont act on it.",

    "Can missing morning erections be caused by depression? I understand that depression can lead to loss of libido and erectile dysfunction. But nowhere I find information whether missing nocturnal  morning erections can be caused by depression as well. And Im not talking about a missing erection once in a while, but total lack of it every day for months. In my limited understanding, morning erections are a pretty much biological thing, which cant be influenced by bad mood or thoughts, so I would assume a depression couldnt impact the presence of these erections. I know about the side effects of antidepressants, but here I am just trying to find out whether regular, untreated depression can cause this lack of nocturnal  morning erections. I feel like I sleep well enough, so missing REM phases is probably unlikely. Any input will be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",
    "Student Burnout and Losing Myself on Antidepressants. Hey, junior in high school here. The final stretch of this semester in an allgirls private school has been pretty exhausting, especially with the high standards they expect there. Im currently and have been remotely learning for about a year in the pandemic and went on medication. Right now I just dropped down to 75 mg of Effexor due to feeling dead and totally unmotivated. My body feels like lead, my eyelids droop, and I just stare into outer space during my classes. I found myself struggling to pick up a pencil last week. I cant even look at my overdue assignments without feeling like I want to crawl back under my warm blankets and fall into a sweet, deep sleep. I declutter my space, eat, hydrate, and let a little sun in, but Im still very fatigued and out of inspiration. Months ago I could barely take care of myself like that, so am I just impatient? Should I just ride it out and try my best with school? Seems like my only option right now. I want to feel like myself and WANT to get my passion back for my hobbies. All I do is school and after that is just endless consumption of media scrolling on tiktok and instagram for hours. Im tired of feeling empty. I dont want to go off of my meds since I want to subdue any overwhelming anxiety while learning how to drive and getting my first job this summer vaccinated and taking precautions, of course. Any tips or advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading.",

To the point where two and a half weeks ago, I went to bed and had my first full blown panic attack while going to sleep had to close my eyes to force myself asleep and not face it. All of a sudden a week later, I woke up and slowly realized throughout the day that Ive never felt like that before. The depression everything was completely gone as if someone just snapped a finger.

    "I don't know what to do I just graduated from high school recently and I thought that would help with all my anxiety but Im just sitting in my room feeling lifeless. I dont sleep or eat regularly, and I barely know the time. The past 5 years have been really difficult for me, and Ive only had 2 people to talk to, one being a school counsellor. I think they just prolonged whatever I have but nothing really helps. I stopped having constant suicidal thoughts since 3 months ago, but it was so sudden and I just feel this lethargic tiredness always lurking. I dont know if its residual or its because everythings physically taking a toll on me. Even when everything I thought was giving me stress was over, nothing changed. And I have been trying to go out and meet my friends. Ive been out of my house more these days than most of my life combined. I thought whatever I was feeling might have been situational but I dont think it is. Ive tried swallowing pills a bunch of times and hurting myself and nothing happened, so I took that as a sign to try to be more healthy, but its not really working. I felt completely fine and then a few weeks ago I took 24 colored pills and thought maybe something would happen, and I just ended up with nausea and a stomach ache. Thats not normal, is it? I even took cough syrup with it. I dont get how nothing can happen, and I really dont get why Im still doing these things when Im not under stress which is usually the only reason I would hurt myself when it all started. I cant meet a paid professional because my parents wouldnt ever believe me. Theyre not bad people but theyre ignorant and misguided, and that mental illnesses only exist for people with real trauma. Theyd say I was lying or faking it. And believe me, Ive tried approaching the topic with them. I had 2 panic attacks in front of them and they still wouldnt let me meet a mental health counsellor even when we went to the hospital and the doctor recommended it. Whats wrong with me? Im just stuck. I dont even know why Im making this post.",

    "I’m tired of pushing forward. Hello all. This is my first time trying to reach out for help and doing so with friends and family feels shameful because I am my familys rock and support system. Its never been the other way around and the few times I asked for some help from my wife its always ended badly. I am 27 Male with a wife who is 28 and a son who is 3. When I met my wife I was already depressed, though never clinically diagnosed. All the signs were there though. Always tired, no motivation, indulging in vices just to feel something. I had no purpose and in all honesty I never ended it because it would be more trouble than it was worth. My mother and sister would be hurt and financially strained from my sudden death so I just lived day in and day out trying to not to sink too low. They were my excuse to live. After meeting my wife things because brighter. My family definitely noticed an improvement in my attitude and I started taking care of my self more. For a while we only hung out, nothing official yet so I wanted to put my best self forward in hopes of building a relationship with this amazing woman. A year later we married and she got pregnant. It was my sons birth that pushed me to go back to school and get a better job. Simply put my finances would not be able to sustain a decent life style. Ive noticed though that slowly over the years Ive started to fall back into the same depressed state of mind. I am unbelievably tired all the time, I have started buying more alcohol than normal and spending more and more time playing online games in hopes of getting some moments or happiness in a day of glum. My wife has noticed and started complaining that Im changing for the worse. I can see it but I just cant seem to do anything about it. I have moments of motivation where I will be good for a couple days but then revert back. Recently I had a bad episode where I just started drinking and wallowing in self pity. My son was already asleep so he wasnt exposed to it. When my wife came home she seemed concerned but didnt really know how to react.",

Ive been feeling depressed for 7 years now and last year I finally found myself strong enough to see a doctor and since then Ive been trying to get therapy but its basically impossible since I dont have private insurance. I am on plenty of waiting lists but Ive not yet gotten one call back. I am scared that at some point it will be too late because Im gone. I want therapy so badly. I need it. I am not able to live a normal life at all, everything weights me down no matter how small the issue is. It affects my daily life way too much. When I start panicking, starting to cry, scream, hurt myself, I want to have myself locked up, so someone can look over me, give me medication, etc. I really want that but the thought of it scares me insanely much. Right now, the only thing bringing me joy is spending time with my boyfriend online. Weve been together for a year now and it couldnt be more perfect, except my disorder ruining a lot of things. I play games with him online, we have so much fun. I dont want to lose that. Additionally I am studying and Id be done next year and graduate. However without some kind of help I know I wont be able to do it. I already had to repeat a whole year because of my issues. I dont know what to do. I really want to be somewhere where I am being watched so I can get help anytime I need it. But I have so much to lose. My partner, my dog, my computer, what if they even take my phone? I started writing this to calm down from another panic attack over something super small and it helped me calm down but I rarely have something to make me calm again so all I usually do is scream and cry and hurt myself for two hours till my body is too tired to even stay awake so I basically just pass out...

    "The Story of This Year Im a 22yo male and Ive been struggling with depression and anxiety since before I can even remember. I was put into the foster care system in Australia when I was 3 and stayed there till I was 18. Thankfully I didnt cycle a lot like most kids and I found a foster family who I now call my real family. Im having a really difficult time at the moment, this year had been really really tough. Im in my 4th year of uni and Ive failed the last 2 years because of my mental state, Ive been seeing counsellors and doctors and Im on medication. 2 weeks ago I got diagnosed with Bipolar II and now been medicated for that. But I just need to vent so Im going to talk about my year and hows its been the worst and best year Ive had in a very long time. So the best year started on the 31st of December 2018. I was at college by myself over Christmas and in news years eve I wanted to spend it with someone because I couldnt with my foster family. I invited 2 friends that were in my town at the time who came over. We sat and chatted for an hour and they started to get bored, my mate asked if he could invite a friend over to join us, I agreed. This friend ended up bringing a fair few people, I would say around 10. Me being anxious as all shit over everything in life, freaked out and stayed silent. I ended up having a few drinks and with each one became more confident and less anxious. Turns out these people were pretty amazing, I made a friend who was 7ft tall and he was honestly the big friendly giant. I made another friend who Ill call Max, we hit it off straight away and Ive never connected so well with someone. We instantly became best friends, he stayed over my place for an entire month until we decided to move out with 2 of our other friends, one of those who was homeless and was desperately trying to find someone to live. A little back story before we get rocky, I lived at a university where at the time our flat 8 bedroom house sorta thing was located on campus. All 8 people were and still are my closest friends. They are a very important part of my life and they mean the world to me.",
    "Can a 14yo have depression and anxiety Hey, a few informations Im on mobile, not a native english speaker, my father divorced and unable to see him only at weekends , middle child of 6, game addictreally bad 58h a day, smart and dumb, lot of people say that Im gifted and mature for my age. I was the normal trouble child. Good but not too good grades. My older siblings use drugs alcohol, weed, Shisha and Cigarettes and were raised like me old school getting slapped like me, it was normal in Germany. I didnt have the same father as any of my siblings. I entered first grade and was a weird child because of my Nigerian side that wears other clothing once a month and almost bold haircut every month to like 2mm. I was darker than anybody darkest at school and only a few friends. My father pickt me up one day and they realise why I was brownlight skinned and started bullying me. They called me things like burned chocolate muffin and other 4th grader insults. After the 4th grade we all enter a new schoolin Germany you Enter a new school after 4th grade with exceptions all the people where really nice and I started to become the main class clown. Got in trouble a lot and the grades where dropping and I got neglected more at home I didnt got attention in my family so I want it in school and our family which was already broken got broken more. My sister was is an entitled bitch and my mother an angel who wants to do their best. The problem is that my mother does this in a completly wrong way and scars us even more. And all their trouble is going straight to me and my small siblings. I sometimes ask my mother what depression feels likeshe had depression in her 20sand she always said you cant have depression youre to young which is always hurting. Because I think she doesnt care enough and always talks shit about my father and the other way too. She only cares about my grades thats why I show her the good ones and false signature the bad ones it works they only look over itafter I realise that I was thinking about suicide how I should do it which ways there are and what last messages I would give to anybody I love. This got worse and worse until I thought about suicide almost everyday.",
    "I feel like I have to kill myself, it's inevitable I think that there isnt any other option, and that in the end it will always come to this anyways. Like no matter what I do, I need to die. Ive always felt like dying is my only option whether I like it or not, and theres really no reason for me to be here anyways. Ive been in therapy and different treatments for so long, and it just always comes back to me wanting to stop existing. There have been days where I think it could get better, but that stops pretty quickly. Ever since middle school Ive been thinking about ending it. Its only until recently that Ive made a true plan and stuff. I feel like a complete asshole because I have a great life, my parents love me, yada yada, and yet I still feel this way. Im still so tired and lonely and I feel like a complete fuckup. Honestly, its not even that I want to commit suicide, I just dont want to exist anymore. Its just that suicide seems like the only way of accomplishing that? I dont know if this even makes any sense.",

    "Can you be depressed and not suicidal? I know its probably a stupid question but I really dont know. Ive had symptoms of depression for a long time, and ive moticed them because friends of mine have been diagnosed for the same things but my friends have all had suicidal ideations at one point or another so I have this mental wall in my head that I cant ask for help because im not really depressed unless im suicidal too. Is it worth me going to the doctors and seeing what they can do or will they really just not do anything unless im a risk to myself like ive read online?",
    "Excessive drinking, help please Hello guys. A friend of mine has always been quite introvert. Preferably staying at home to read a book. He hated alcohol, partying and smoking. And he used to be very socially awkward. Since he became depressed, he started drinking and partying a lot. He also gets drunk quite often, sometimes this will make him scared and I would have to go get him. This isnt the person he used to be. And I know alcohol is bad for his Multiple Sclerosis and Depression. He is using antidepressants. But he doesnt seem to care. I dont recognize him when he behaves like that.. All the while he keeps ignoring peoples texts because he doesnt have the energy to respond. But apperently he does have te energy to party? Which is something i do not understand. I will have a talk with him tomorrow. What can I do or say to support him? How do I make him realize that his behavior is selfdestructive without making things worse? What could be his reason to drink so much alcohol? I really want to understand this huge change in personality, but I keep thinking that depression isnt an excuse for it. Please give me some insight.",
    "I started isolating myself again Struggled with depression for a long time, Im currently doing ok in my life. I got sick a few weeks ago and cancelled all my plans, since then Ive really struggled with making any. After work I sometimes message some people but mostly just watch TV. Every weekend my parents go out to meet friends and I stay at home alone. Ive slowly been getting back to messaging and calling certain friends, but I keep avoiding or cancelling making plans. This is partially due to low energy but also because my self hatred is so bad that Im convinced all these lovely people secretly hate me and dont ever want to spend time with me and Im doing them a favor by not being in their lives as much",
    "Severe treatment resistant depression Tried therapy meds lifestyle changes exercise basically everything what do I do ? am I doomed in this condition ? Will it ever ends ? The title basically summed it up Ive been dealing with depression for around a year till now and it just gets worse with time please dont suggest things like fight it dont give up theres nothing to fight or to give up on. Depression affects everyone differently and My depression Isnt the type where I have negative thinking or suicidal that I can get over with therapy my depression is basically severe anhedonia and fatigue Nothing absolutely nothing I can enjoy foods doesnt taste good girls dont make me feel horny orgasms are numb dog doesnt make me feel happy friendship and exercise doesnt help me a bit. So theres nothing to fight its just that the reward centers in my brain for some reason decided to turn off and no matter what I do I cant get them to turn back on again. And please please dont suggest working on the root cause Im not depressed because I dropped my ice cream or because the teacher yelled at me Im depressed because I have fcked up genetics and Im trying to cure it. I fking tried everything I tried therapy I tried Cognitive Behavioral Therapy I tried every antidepressant SSRI SNRI Tricyclic Wellbutrin Mirtazapine Atypical antipsychotics they helped minor symptoms like concentrationfatigueinsomnia but did absolutely nothing for my anhedonia. Anhedonia destroyed my relationships costed my friends took my gf away obliterated my college marks and pretty much is fcking up my life So what do I do ? Keep living in this condition and not giving up ? but for what if nothing I do I enjoy whats the point of living on ? if theres no chance that a brighter tomorrow will come what point is there in going on ?

    "At 43 (M), depression is new to me and I don't know how to handle it. Im a married man, to a wonderful woman. We love each other tons and consider each other our best friend. We recently made a huge move across the country and for the first couple of years, my wife was so unhappy. Despite having a couple of college friends in the area, as well as some of her family, she missed her parents, her job sucked, she just was miserable. And this made me miserable, because the move was mostly my idea as jobs for me are more plentiful where we are. But weve always had evenings and weekends and love our time together. We go on day trips, check out restaurants, everything together. Then we both got new jobs and the world changed. Suddenly, I was working from home and have been since early March, 2020, while she continues to go into work in healthcare. Her new job is mentally stressful, but really great for her. Shes making friends with the women she works with, which would make me SO HAPPY... except now Im the odd man out. My day is make us breakfast, make her lunch, take her to work, come home and work from home, go pick her up from work, make dinner, do the dishes, etc. Of COURSE she helps around the house. Laundry, cat boxes, taking out trash, etc. Im not mentioning my chores to show an imbalance, just a monotony. A few weeks ago her work friends planned a gettogether after work. She mentioned that I should come by when they were almost done with dinner so I could grab a few drinks with everyone. I parked the car and texted her that I was nearby. She said, uh oh. I dont think they wanted husbandsboyfriends here. So I drove all the way back home and realized something. Im lonely and depressed. I knew I was down about working from home. Im a very outgoing person and need human interaction and its been soulcrushing. But once my wife had something with friends that didnt involve me, I realized that I have nothing but her.",
    "Is anyone in the same position as me? For the longest time I thought I was some kind of psychopath because of the whole complete lack of empathy, manipulation, charm and general lack of feelings. But then I thought Im probably just exaggerating that too to feel better about myself. I crave labels. I crave being put into a box so I can belong to something. I can be recognised. I can be remembered. Ill probably update in the comments when I remember more about myself.",

    "Breaking up gave me depression.. and I want to speak my mind.. please be nice. I did not think I would end up this way. Drowning in selfpity in my room creating a post on Reddit because I cant express how I feel to anyone. Im just hoping this venting post could make me feel slightly better. Im not looking for pity, I just needed to speak out my mind. It was a 4year relationship, I broke up December 2019, Its been months. Ive done all I can, move to a new country, try a new sport, meet new people, and many more. I cant say that things did not get better in time, because it did. Time heals all. It helped me move on and lose most of my feelings for her, but it left a pretty nasty scar on me. So if time heals, whats the problem?? I dont wanna be a whiny prick, because we all go through breakups, and my situation is certainly not harder than anyones situation in this world. I just need a place where I can speak out my mind and not be judged. I dated a girl that I idolized, I see her for the angel that shes not. I was blinded by my feelings, and I see that now. Dont get me wrong, she was wonderful, loving, caring, and it just didnt work out. Around August 2019, we moved from our hometown to different countries for University We started an LDR. After our 4th year of dating, she started changing. Id like to believe that it was the people that she surrounded herself within University because I have never seen her act this way. When November 2019 came, she started doing something that ruined me. She would go out drinking and kept it from me, she also started ghosting me for days. I was not used to being ghosted because, throughout our 4 years of dating, she has never done that. And really, being ghosted by her ruined me so much. I started getting panic attacks. Initially, It was once every two weeks, then it became once a week, then it became 23 times a week. Eventually, she broke it off in December 2019.",
    "Real Down Ive been feeling really really down lately to the extent where I just dont want to do anything but curl up in bed or be absolutely alone. Im mentally and emotionally tired. I just started a new job doing something I thought I would be happy doing. I had plans, I had a goal. 2 weeks into it and everything seems to be falling apart. I realised Im utterly unhappy with what Im doing and the place Im doing it. I left my previous job though the work life was simpler there and rushed into this new job because I was stagnant there going nowhere in the company and pay. Ive never been able to hold a job for long 3 years the most and Im always unhappy with the job. I do know there are other jobs out there which I could be better in but never took the risk fearing the low pay starting from bottom as I have plenty of commitments. I fear starting afresh My wife has been the main financial support in the family and shes doing way better than me. However the saddest thing I found out recently was that she is also very stressed out and unhappy with her job. The only reason why she is staying on is because I am not financially stable. My wife is such a wonderful woman and she doesnt deserve this. In summary Im 31, not getting any younger, not going anywhere in life, in debt, no savings, unhappy my job, unhappy with myself, a burden. is someone cutting onions?",
    "Death Anxiety Like, Ill feel great doing these things and then Ill think that was nice, but Im going to forget that it happened and cease to exist eventually. Ugh. The whole thing makes life feel unreal and dreamlike. Im scared to die. I want to be alive. I want my self to be connected to everything. I dont want to fade away into nothing. Ive tried spirituality and I will continue to because i think does help more like a temporary fix though, but its based on so many opinionsmaskingastruths that my overactive brain just wont stop picking it apart and reducing it whenever I try to participate. I guess Im sad that Im stuck right now being a reductionist and a realist, and that my inner self seems to want to do this even though I know Im much happier when Im blissfully ignoring these kinds of questions. Now I get the sense that if I ever want out of this, Ill have to think my way out but every time I try it seems to make it worse. I dig myself deeper into this pit by engaging with it. I can feel myself enjoying music, art, video games, podcasts, books and movies less. They all feel like distractions, which I guess everyone kinda knows they are, but it just feels really clear and I wish it wasnt. If any of this sounds like you, and youve gotten past it, please let me know. Note I switched up my meds and they do seem to be helping with stuff like anxiety attacks and suicidal ideation but the depression feels deeper than just a chemical imbalance",

    "I lost my job and potentially my career due to a deep depression. Hello, I 27F am using my alternative account because there are people who are trying to hurt me with anything they can find out about me. I was diagnosed with Anxiety, depression, and Bipolar disorder at the age of 11 and have always struggled, but I functioned for the most part. A little over a year ago, I was in the darkest place of my life. My dad had just had a major heart attackstrokeaneurism and was destined to die according to doctors he beat the odds with months of comastherapy. My favorite aunt had committed suicide and left my two high school aged cousins motherless. Most terribly though, my ex had blindsided me and illegally started a child custody battle to take my only child, a 7 year old, away from me who I have raised his whole life. I spent all my personal investmentssavings, 15,000, to hire a top attorney and was left broke and completely shattered. My partner was there to support me as much as he could so my son an i had a roof over our head but i was suffering. Shortly before this all happened, I had completed my 1 year internship at a major Financial Firm amp had gained my Series 7 amp Series 66 FINRA licenses. I was so proud of my accomplishments, salary, and stability after 10 years of customer service and sales jobs that did not provide full stability. I was so happy, the happiest I had been in a long time, and then everything came crashing down at the same time. I had an amazingly supportive boss who helped me every step of the way until I exhausted my PTO, UTO, FMLA, Short Term Personal Leave and he had run out of options to offer me. During all this time, I was nothing but a husk. I wouldnt leave my bed, eat, shower, and I spent hours just sleeping. My partner didnt know what to do and Psychiatrist were unavailable due to a large shortage in my city over 6 month waits and up to 9 months. I refused to go to an inpatient facility because I knew it would hurt my child custody case but at the time, that probably would have been the best option. This went on for over 3 months.",
    "I feel like no one understands me, and it makes me incredibly lonely When I was in school, I thought it would get better in my 20s. Im now approaching 30, but Im still not seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. I tried to understand others, to listen to their problems without judgement, and to give advice when asked. Ive been told that Im a good listener and a good friend. But when I need someone to talk to, no one seems to understand. Sometimes I am ignored, other times I am misinterpreted and even criticised. The more I try, the more I am misunderstood, and the more I feel frustrated. I tried to improve myself, to read books, to try to think more rationally, and to communicate more clearly, so that others can understand me better. But after years of trying, it still seems fruitless. I hate going out to parties, where everyone talks over each other, and no one listens. The more I socialise, the lonelier I feel. Its no ones fault, really. I have a sensitive temperament that makes me a bit out of sync, a little hard for others to understand, I know that. I cant change who I am, nor can I change other people. But this doesnt make the pain go away. I can feel myself changing over time, becoming more cynical, more critical, and less trustful. I know how counterproductive it is, but I dont know how else to cope. On some days I feel like wanting to end all of this somehow. I just came out of a bad depression, where I spent entire days in bed and even had suicidal thoughts Im feeling a little better now. Im thinking of going to therapy, but Im hesitant because of the virus going around. Im also thinking of moving to another city and start over after the virus ends of course, but Im not sure if this would help. Id hate to waste so much effort just to end up back at the same place. I guess Im just looking for is some advice from people who have personally been through something similar what worked for you? how did things improve? No generic advice please Ive already spent a lot of time googling. Thanks in advance",

Not a day goes by when I dont consider suicide due to my physical maladies. My physical maladies are only the start! After all, according to my Psychiatrist, I have Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, ObsessiveCompulsive Disorder, and Autism. My father didnt want to raise me. I have a mother who berates me regularly and my stepfather who is an angeraddict. I dont have any friends. Ive had five jobs in the past 365 days, but none of them have worked out. Hell, I cant even figure out for gender identity or sexual orientation for crying out loud! I know someone is going to tell me to go see a therapist and a doctor, but all I can say is that I do. It doesnt matter. Im broken. I expect to die of esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, or some other such terminal disease. Life has lost all its meaning. I would rather be dead that going through all this suffering. And nobody seems to ever read my posts, and if they do, they write insulting replies. I am worse than Hitler and Stalin combined.

    "TW; First Fatherless Father's Day I23m lost my dad to covid19 at the start of this year. I woke up and realized what day it is and just started sobbing. My partner25f lost her dad at a young age and has numbed herself to cope as his passing played a huge part in the path her life took, but this is still fresh for me. Its the first Fathers Day without him. I asked for some support from her and her responses were very cold. You cant let today hurt you like this. I just ignore this day, you gotta just stay off your phone. You cant cry all day about this. I get that shes had time to cope with this trauma, and her responses are partly to protect herself from her feelings about her own dad shes been dealing with for years, but fuck. I needed support, just some time to let it out and confront my feelings, and after the way she responded Im no longer sure how I feel about this woman. What would you do? I try really hard to be understanding of others feelings, and especially compassionate of my partners feelings. But I honestly dont know if I can be with someone who would invalidate my feelings like that, even with their own trauma. She came to apologize and acknowledge that she was being inconsiderate, but that hurt me so much I dont even want to look at her right now. I dont know. I love this woman, and Im incredibly patient with partners. Her responses show a fundamental lack of compassion that I cant teach, but her apology shows an understanding of her fuck up and an attempt to right it, so I dont know what to do about it. Maybe after I take some time to cool off we can talk about it and gain better understanding. For anyone else hurting today, Im so sorry, just remember our fathers are out there somewhere, having a big cookout in the sky, fighting over Grill Master and looking down pridefully at the amazing children they made.",
    "Is being home triggering my depression? Hi. Im not too familiar with this subreddit but honestly I really need someone to talk to right now. Ive been diagnosed with medical depression anxiety for a couple years now, taking medication and am now generally doing pretty well. I started college in the fall and the semester was amazing. However, since winter break started Ive been having awful feelings about just living. I wouldnt say I have major suicidal tendencies but heck Ive thought about it. I want to pain to go away so badly. Its gotten to the point where I feel physically sick. I cant stop crying. I feel awful. Im lonely here and things arent the way they used to be. That automatically fills me with anxiety. I havent felt this way in so long and I thought I never would again. I dont know what I need but maybe someone here could help. Im scared to fall asleep because of the nightmares Ive been having. Maybe someone could talk. Idk.",
    "idk how to get better since 7th grade ive cried myself to sleep so many times and ive hurt myself before but i got better, i dont think i was ever diagnosed with depression but i am with anxiety. Im in 9th grade now this has been happening for a little more than 2 years. recently its like the darkness is coming back. my room is a mess and i have no motivation for anything. I keep crying breaking down and im so scared to tell anyone i dont know how to ask for help. i have a counselor but i just tell him im fine and feeling good. Its like i freeze and im physically unable to speak about it. i dont want this darkness to come back but its already here. ive thought about suicide even but i dont want to hurt the few people who really care about me. I know suicide is wrong, i just dont want to live like this anymore, constantly getting hurt and dragged down until im crying so hard my body is literally shaking while i struggle to breathe. its like whenever im happy something happens and my happiness gets ripped away and im isolated with my own thoughts and they just get darker and more complex as time goes on. i feel worthless, like im just a background character im peoples lives. ive been told that im loved and people care about me but when you hear it 1,000,000 times and nobody shows they care it just becomes that same old speech. i dont know how to get better i dont know how to reach out for help. i just cant take this anymore. how do i be happy?",
    "I feel so empty Its been nearly four months since my dog passed. And Ive had maybe a handful of good days. I cant even make a ham sandwich without getting upset sometimes. Ive been up since midnight and I cant get back to sleep. My sleep patterns are all over the place. Setting a set time for sleep just adds to my stress. And the. My anxiety goes all haywire. I did start one of my hobbies back up, but I noticed I can easily get lost in it and blow time I need to do chores or run errands. And while its good distraction , it hasnt gotten its joy back yet. Just finding a new routine without my caregiving duties, and especially without mymy Moms dog has just been hell. Nothing feels as good and any step I take is without them. I literally got a slight raise at work, and the first person I wanted to tell, I couldnt because shes gone. Its like I cant even be happy with anything because I dont have anyone to share it with who cares. Even when my dog was here, I still felt pride that I was doing good for her and making her life a little better. I dont know. Life just isnt as fun without them. And while I dont feel suicidal, every thing just feels like motions and so dull. Sorry to post yet again, the sad anxiety just really gets to me.",

    "Staying POSITIVE is ALREADY hard and now I am the caregiver to a SUICIDAL FRIEND Hi guys, I dont know if this is the right forum for my overall mixed content. Im 23 F. And I need some advice on my situation. Appreciate it if yall could share with me your thoughts. To start off, I have both anxiety and depression. I know that with those 2, it definitely would be a roller coaster ride with my emotions and I am familiar with this as it is like a cycle that I kept having to go through. I would say that my depression is not as severe as my anxiety though. So back to my main story. Recently I have been busy trying to help a suicidal friend. I have known her for 7 years plus and am aware that she was suffering from depression. I always thought that it was going to be okay as time goes by but then I realized it worsened. She was really going all out on ending her life that I had to call the police on her. Thing is, she has been planning out her will and settling whatever she considered as necessity for the preparation of her demise. Its like i am scared but I have no choice to take charge as she does not have a good rs with her family. I managed to persuade her to go and seek help from the professional. She was adamant but somehow agreed eventually. First medication didnt work so we changed to another type. End up, she decided to stop taking the medication all by herself. She went MIA for about a week or so. When she finally texted, it was bad news  she was prepping to end her life. I had to call the police on her. Apparently she lied to them that she was okay and would be attending her appointment, so they couldnt do anything in my country the police can only intervene if you are caught in the act of committing suicide. However later on she berated me as she felt that I had betrayed her. She however continued to confide in me. I was pretty much unsure what to do so I wrote a letter to the family secretly I know where she stays and i made sure to text her mum that I had put a letter outside their house gate.",
    "I feel like my subconscious is trying to keep me depressed Lately Ive been struggling with my mental health. Its gotten to the point that I feel physically sick from it, and Im fed up. Im a person who gets stuck on details and repeating the past in my head over and over to the point that I get sick. And then the next day Ill be extremely hyper and euphoric for about 4 hours and swing immediately back into this depressive state like its my default state. I feel like no one likes me and that I have no friends, and the reason that Im in a leadership position in theatre is because my director feels bad for me. Although people tell me that thats not true I cant engrain that into my head for some reason. Part of me knows that Im being irrational and overthinking everything, but I cant stop. It feels like Im subconsciously looking for something to upset me and get me down so I can keep feeding my depression, and I hate it. I want to get better, I really really do, yet my brain wont let me. I keep making things a way bigger deals in my head than they actually should be. I keep feeling like people are out to get me when theyre not. Its like I have tow people living in my head, the depressed one is in charge, and the rational one is being held captive and out of control. Its negatively impacting my relationships. Please, Im begging, if anyone knows how to stop this please tell me. Im so tired of everything getting spun out of control in my head.",
    "My Government won't support my parents any longer for having me Disclaimers Never posted on reddit before, but I dont know who else to talk to. The grammar will be off because I am quite upset as I type this, my apologies. Quick backstory Ive suffered from depression ever since I was around 16, now Im soontobe 25. I tried seeing a therapist back when I was 18 and started university. She was truly awful and I thought I had no right to see a therapist. Fast forward to january 2019, I decided to try another therapist because I am truly incapable of living in this state. I still havent finished university. Im trying but failing. Im incapable of doing most tasks, let alone focus on studying. Although I have a job I dont get paid much. I depend on my parents who try to support me, but soon wont have the governments support because Im too old to count as a child. I just found out and I feel aweful. I never wanted to be a burden to my parents. Theyre not made of money, and although my mom said she wont kick me out, I know shes growing impatient. Shes having a difficult time understanding me anyways and this will only make it so much harder. I struggle very hard not to let the thought of ending it all so theyll be better of take over. Because I know my mom wont be better of knowing Ive commited suicide. I dont want to die. I just cant live. Does anyone on this reddit know how to deal with this? I should talk to my therapist about this, I know. But my next session wont be for another 2 weeks.",
    "My problems So my hate is even getting worse to be honest I just hate my friends and everyone. I regret ever meet them to be honest even tho I dont want to think like this. They did nothing wrong I just have deep hate and its annoying it repeats in my head and I want to punch something really bad but I hold it back. Man I am just completely sad like I really am sad man I dont do shit I like anymore I want to find something to numb the pain and I want to hurt my self with something man just dont know what tho. All this verbal abuse shit that I still goes on in my life made me think about love completely different then anyone to be honest I will probably not even ask anyone out to be honest just might not even going to try. Anyone that trys to be nice to me I tend to say thank you but in reality I doubt myself I dont think anyone likes me even my own parents I just dont trust much feelings anymore just does not even matter to me I see it as a joke to be honest. I am probably going back to my really bad phase of depression I think happen in 9th grade even thought of killing myself even if I go back to that phase I wont kill myself Only two of my friends knows this will probably tell them about this shit sooner or later idk",

    "Hey. Hi. I wanted to reach out. To have a genuine interaction with another person. No pretenses or ulterior motives. Im on the balcony of a hotel in Thailand and looking out at that long drop, it just makes me wonder what if. I dont know if Ive ever felt as lost as I do tonight. In my cynicism I fear that people dont actually genuinely carefor others, me included, and why would they eh? Does that kind of warmth and love exist in the world outside of fairytales and movies? I have these doubts so I really dont reach out usually, even to the people I surround myself with. But right now maybe Im chasing rainbows again, but Id like some genuine communication, even if its on the internet and under the mask of anonymity. If anyone would care. If you would take the time to hear me. Im 22. I live in South Korea and Ive been quite sad, depressed, since the 9th grade. Its been 8 years. I feel like Ive lost a lot of what made me me in that time. I feel like an empty shell. All the color and life sucked out and nothing but an empty husk left. Yet despite all that Ive lost, I believe I have much more to lose still, because I have despaired before, believing Ive hit rock bottom. Then time would pass and Id look back, only to realize how much I had back then. When I first started to have depressing thoughts, self doubt, existential problems, I turned to my family for help. My mother, father and sister. Why? because theyre my family, and I thought it would matter to them that I, their son, was suffering so genuinely, in so much pain and doubt. When I was so lost and confused and desperately reaching out to them, they fucking turned their back on me. Or so I felt, back then and I still do. I felt so betrayed that the people I loved and trusted the most in the world would do that so I became bitter and made a promise to myself that Id never share my life with them again.",

I have a huge fear that he will leave me, which I have expressed to himand which he always denies, but I know it must get annoying that I keep bringing it up, though I cant seem to help myself. I cant imagine how annoying and difficult it must be for him to come home from work and not know if hes coming home to see me on an okay day or a really bad day. ampx200B Our communication isnt bad, but Ive recently felt myself pulling away and trying to rely on my own inner strength, but sometimes that backfires and I do a 180 and turn into an absolute mess with him. ampx200B I feel like he deserves so much better than having basically a halfwife who is so unsteady.

    "I don’t know what to do anymore Im scared. Im so scared right now. Ive been bottling up every bit of negative emotion, Ive been smiling and saying Im ok. Ive been pretending out of fear.

Nothing is going to change. If I say anything Ill break. If I say anything itll all end. I dont know what to do. I want to talk. I want to scream.

Its getting harder and harder to lie. I lie everyday, my very existence is in itself a lie. I want to tell somebody, but who do I tell? Who is left? The smile is crumbling. Im afraid when it comes off Ill break, literally. Im afraid that itll end in an outburst. Im afraid.

    "Advice on personal hygiene/self care Hi everyone! This is my first post on reddit so please forgive me if I dont do this right p Ive struggled with severe depression for about 12 years or so now, and lately it seems to be getting worse. Its gotten to a point where I dont have motivation to do the most basic of things  such as showering daily, brushing my hair, even brushing my teeth... its incredibly embarrassing, but I just cant find it in myself to care. I used to put a lot of effort into my appearance, and I took pride in how I presented myself. Now though, I feel as if its pointless. I feel like the way I present myself currently is an accurate portrayal of how I feel inside. Does anyone have any advice on how to change this, or how to find motivation, or anything at all? Id greatly appreciate any ideas on how I could improve on this. I feel ashamed when I show up to work in the same outfit, or with my hair in a tangled bun because I couldnt be bothered to brush it. Not ashamed enough to change though, I guess. Thank you in advance for any responses, and thank you for taking the time to read this",
    "I just need some advice about my new psychiatrist, I am shocked Ill try to be as brief as possible I was diagnosed with depression around five years ago, when I was only 17, after I tried to commit suicide. As a consequence, I started seeing a therapist while also taking medications. And I actually saw some improvements. However, Everything went downhill Two years ago, when my mother passed away. She was the person I loved the most in the world, and the only one who never made me feel guilty about my problems, so because I am dumb as fuck I just disappeared, never contacted my therapists again, stopped my medications, and moved to London while also taking drugs and leading a very wild life until I almost killed myself. I have now come home for nearly one year, and I made the hard decision of starting therapy again. Last week I went to see a psychiatrist that a friend of mine suggested me to see. After he asked me a few questions whose answers I am not sure he understood since he kept interrupting me, he told me, Listen to me, kid, you are not sick, or depressed, look at yourself, you are all pretty and dolled up, you are probably just sad because your mum died, you simply need to toughen up and get over it, and youll be fine I Was shocked. I left his office crying, and now I am totally at a loss. Should I give up on therapy? Should I see thiS guy again and give him a second chance? I dont know what to do.. maybe I am just destined to be miserable.",

Shes also made many attempts to kill herself. Every few weeks, she gets into a suicidal state again. And the part that makes it the hardest to help her is that, she has tried therapy many times and it didnt work.

I have a pile of books Ive bought but never read, and sadly, its not because Im just too slow at getting through them. Its like, when I try to do something that isnt work, I get these voices not literal in my head screaming you shouldnt be doing this. The more I try to have fun, the worse I feel about it.

I graduated  though there wasnt a ceremony or anything thanks Covid  and felt... nothing. I didnt feel pride, or relief, or anything. It was like Id just finished washing the dishes  okay, thats done, whats next? A couple of years back, I got my black belt in a very difficult martial art after 7 years of training three times a week. The test was a fourhour ordeal that literally involved, at one point, blood streaming down my face as I fought a marine twice my size they paused it for a few minutes so I could clean myself up. When they announced the results a few days later, I didnt feel pride, or accomplishment.",
    "Meds? To keep it short my mental has steadily been deteriorating. I finally decided to seek help and start seeing a therapist. I didnt know what to expect or how anyone couldve helped me. Three sessions in and I dont see a point of therapy? He keeps asking me the same thing and suggests I get on anti depressants. Im not against giving it a shot but Im just disappointed at how therapy went. Can anyone here tell me their experience with anti depressants?",
    "Nothing feels good 22M. Literally nothing feels good. I spend my day solving tediously difficult problems with little resources and poor instructions. Hours of frustration. Eating is just another chore that doesnt bring any joy, unless I eat bullshitjj foods in which case again it will make me feel even worse than the little pleasure it brought me. Masturbating is basically a desperation attempt for something to feel good but honestly its just lack luster, there is no real desire. And if I watch porn it will feel good, but I dont because porn will make me feel even worse after. There is no emotional support from anyone, no one cares about a young mans feelings. Finishing at the gym makes me feel a little good, but its fucking exhausting and the energy and effort I put into it feels as shitty if not more so than the little dopamine I get after. I think this is where my problems with women come in. I want them badly, because sex with women feels awesome. Having a woman around is validating and feels awesome. Cuddling feels awesome. It feels like a woman is the only thing that can bring good feeling into my life without having an immediate and often worse downside. And I know this is problematic thinking. Everything just feels shit. And everything that feels good will make you pay.",
    "I'm so uninterested in everything, any advice on how to enjoy / care about things again? tldr at the bottom Im taking SSRIs and Vyvanse for my ADHD and they help me function, but a big problem Im still facing is the fact that Im just so bored with life at the moment. I make music and thats cool, but I never go out, never want to do fun things with my partner, never want to do much of anything besides play video games and watch youtube while mindlessly scrolling. Its putting a real strain on my life because I used to love going out but I just feel so eh about everything now to the point that when I do make myself do things it feels like a chore. Any advice you guys can give me? Medication suggestions? Things I can do myself?",

Everyday I find a way to fk it up more somehow, I find a way to disappoint loved ones or just people in general.

Like???? I cant believe this, we are friends, if anything Id say platonic friends, I dont know what to do, I just had my whole day and mental ruined by 5 voice messages and its just adding up to me wanting to end my fkn life even more. Some background, Im a very needy person Im the type of person to always reply instantly because Im always checking for friends messages because I feel without them Im unhappy, I love having someone giving me their attention all day, might sound toxic but so be it, Im nothing without friends either way.

    "Am I Disabled Enough? one house. We live in a room with my two daughters. Due to Covid and being a lifeguard during this time, my partner lost his job at the pool. So there is no employment. Both of us have been job seeking, him about a year and me since bub was weaned. Weve also been rental searching but theres just nothing in our price range and those that ARE dont want an unemployed family. I have nightmares, PTSD flashes for me thats flashes of rage that make me barely restrain the urge to hurt myself or very occasionally other people. Or flashes of devastation that take me out by causing hysterical sobbing and emotional pain Panic attacks and depressive numbness that could last for days where I struggle to care about anything at all even my beautiful kids. Im try, hes trying and we are drowning while my depression uses the situation to become even worse. So finally Ive decided enough is enough. Im going to the doctor to talk about options for disability and what services can help. so finally we come to the point of this post. Am I disabled? because as silly as it sounds reading this as if it were someone else Id think yes of course but because its ME my brain keeps saying that Im being a fool. Ill be cast out of the doctors office and banned from Centrelink and lose everything if I try. I feel greedy and stupid and mean and lazy even thinking about applying. Anyone got a similar story or any idea if Im even eligible? I swear I dont want to sit on benefits and drain resources, I just want some help getting a job that wont put me in a hospital or the ground due to my condition and maybe some help getting a place so Im not boxed in.

I often need to externalize my emotions and I throw them on me to punish me. Mentally I dont really make me feel good but I also bite and hit myself.

I feel so ashamed and embarrassed, not of my actions as much as the fact that the whole word had to find out about it. I know youre thinking, this kid is in school, still a teenager and probably just overthinking it, but I literally cant go to the city center without fearing for my own life. I live in one of the biggest cities in the world, Ive lived here since forever and I know how big it is. I didnt think it would get this far, but it has. There is not one person I know that doesnt know about this. I cant have any friends here because everyone judges me and no one can ever see me for who I am, they even found ways to get to my friends abroad. I have nowhere to go, and no method of escaping the thoughts I get. I get mad at the world and I want to take revenge for all the people that hurt me but then I realize I could never possibly do that so then I feel powerless, just like how I felt all those other times when IT happened to me. So then I get mad at myself, and I make myself believe it was all my fault, and this leads to a cycle of self harm which very quickly develops into a fine line between life and death.

    "I don't know if this has any logic, but I think I have daytime depression and anxiety Im in an unusual situation.

My depression and anxiety lift, and I start enjoying life until the next day. Im off medication for a couple of months, but to be honest, I feel better now than when I was on meds.

It didnt work, but I had a weird reaction, I was on 300mg before bedtime, but it didnt make me sleepy at all, it only gave me a stuffed nose, it was impossible to breathe through my nose without Olynth.

Abuse, sexual assault, violence, suicide, self harm, NSFW, and addiction is all mentioned. Tread with care. ._. Just a little background I am an 18 year old preeverything FTM in high school. I live with my parents and my disabled younger brother. I almost attempted suicide last night, I guess. A friend talked me through it and helped me fall asleep, but now that Im awake all the feelings have just come back. I have been casually suicidal for like, 2 years at this point and have attempted suicide twice before. The thing is, I really dont want to die. I just want it all to stop hurting. Its just that nothing Ive found so far can make it stop hurting. Id just.. really like some advice about where to turn now, thats all. And maybe some validation or support. A lot of things have happened over the course of my life, and it gets really long. So like I said, Ill add another TLDR at the end, but here are the events that have lead up to now, listed neatly in chronological order. I have a lot of memory gaps, which I assume is a defense mechanism against trauma, so I will try my best. Before I was born, my parents who had met at 12 and 13, and are still married at 41 and 42 were severely abusive to each other. Physical fights, using weapons or objects to harm each other, severe emotional abuse. My mom tells me about a time she kicked my dad down the stairs 3 times while he was drunk, just for fun, and laughed at him each time. She laughed about it as she told the story despite the mortified look on my face. I swear, theres something wrong with her. Both of my parents had really bad home lives growing up, apparently, but my dad especially. Anyway, my dad was an alcoholic troublemaker who always ended up in juvy, or eventually jail. My mom was some sort of sick twisted bitch or whatever.",

Yesterday he told me I was becoming too much to handle. Hes told me he doesnt have the capability to feel empathy, so every time I have an episode he thinks Im fighting with him. Ive told him multiple times Im having an internal battle that has nothing to do with him. My episode was stressing him out and he left. We live together and he went to stay with his cousin that lives 3 hours away. I dont want to be alone and Ive never felt so angry at myself for making him leave. I just need comfort and support.

To start, I watched this video on YouTube after scrolling through my recommendations for a bit. httpsyoutu.bemB_0FXiFHd0 To be honest, I thought it was pretty sad, and it spoke to me in a way Ive never felt. Afterwards, I began to feel an emotional hole in my chest, or, a void. Im not sure what feeling this video triggered, but its happened to me only a few times before, and its never been this bad. Going on 6 days now, whenever i think of the girl in the video, I think of the song and what she went through. I feel it. It doesnt matter where I am, what I am doing, or who Im with. Ive also began to feel less motivated to do things in my pastime. As a naive junior in hs, Im really not sure what to make of all this. Help would be much appreciated.

    "I'm getting angry at my depression. I want to break out of it and I can't seem to shake it. There are tons of various things that have contributed to my mental state at this age. Abusive parents with narcissistic personality disorder, running around with bad friends, I was molested sort of, and publicly, starting drugs in middle school and becoming addicted by highschool, heavy psychedelic use, and whatever quirky autistic spectrum disorder or attention disorder caused school to be so overwhelming for me growing up. I want to feel better, thats for sure. But I look at normal functioning and it doesnt match my ideal for what a human life should be. Ive looked down on normalcy for a long time because it leads to brainwashed nonindividuals, not questioning yourself, and honestly I think it limits our evolution.

Im going to school to become a teacher, before this I had a 2 year existential crisis where I didnt want to do ANYTHING and I would become psychotic and suicidal, I just hated everything in life and I felt like I had tasted multiple ways of living and none of them resonated with me.

My GF and I have been in an onoff relationship for 7 years and have been together since highschool. 25M24F. Last summer she broke up with me over because she wanted to experience other things which she didnt come up front and said that I just figured. It was an extremely rough month for me after that but slowly got over it. Few months later Over the holidays she decides to try and come back into my life. I tried not to sleep with her for a bit since I knew thats what she wanted at first. Now were back together but I found out that she slept with what was a close friend over the break up. She also was dating someone off tinder for majority of the break up and all of this is just really fucking me up. I really love this girl and I am trying to move forward since she claims that she loves me and wants to have a future with me.

Theres a part of me that just gets sadder when I see posts from my friends showing off their engagement rings or the places theyve traveled. Im not supposed to feel that way so I try to ignore it, but the emotion becomes so overwhelming that I can no longer ignore it. Im supposed to be happy for them. I should stop wallowing in pity. An unspoken pitfall of depression is that you can become quite selfabsorbed. Id love to be in a relationship, but not many people want to date the mentally ill guywhich I guess is reasonable. Another shitty thing is that my religion teaches youre not even allowed to think about sex before marriage, which makes my life so much harder now that I associate every urge I have with guilt.

Also I became incredibly more awkward, in trying to better myself, I became super apologetic and passive. I struggle to joke around because I dont want to offend, or I just feel awkward. I never know what to say, and I am always trying to think like is this what a good person does. Which inches closer to today. I struggle so hard with making friends, I dont have much interesting skills. I dont have much hobbies besides piano, business, and like history. I am not super funny. I am awkwrd and uncomfortable with new people. I am needy. I am dependent on social interaction yet I get none. I am not as good looking as I once was. I feel so unattractive. Like why would anyone want to be friends with me, and no matter how hard I try to get out there or be interesting, it seems I am always the one putting all of the effort to relationships. I am the one chasing, and no one is giving me any thought. I actually am in a relationship though, we started dating in april.",
    "Anger Im 17M and have suffered from depression and panic disorder for a year and a half. I dont talk to my parents about it because I dont want to trouble them. For a past couple of months, I have been unable to handle anger. First off, I get angry too easily and start hitting my head and punching the wall or if possible, I try cutting. As if depression wasnt enough, anger is now sapping my energy and the little will to live. I would be thankful for any advice or support.",
    "Spiraling out of control I can confidently say this is the hardest my depression has hit me in the 10 years Ive been struggling. I find myself so angry, lashing out at people who love me and just destroying everyone in my path. I just wish I could have a second chance at this. I am super hard on myself and cannot seem to control the negative self talk. I beat myself up over everything, especially not being able to control my emotions. Ive seen so many mental health professionals that I just get tired of telling my story over and over again. Committing myself to therapy or standing psych appointments seems more exhausting than suffering alone. I dont know what advice Im exactly looking for, so please forgive me if this is all over the place. Im just desperate. Im thinking ending my life, but Im definitely too much of a coward to carry it out. Any input or kind words are welcomed. Thank you",

    "Bottling up and i cant anymore In short i was depressed and had social anxiety and generalized anxiety for a couple years. For the last few months i can say finnaly i am no longer depressed or my depression has gotten really better as there are still days when i feel extremly low but those days happen maybe onde or twice in two weeks. My social anxiety is i would say seriously lower as i could not speak to people and now i have almost no trouble approaching a stranger but keeping longer conversation is still a struggle but im working on it i just need practice. The biggest problem was GAD... I spent half of 2018 and whole 2019 in constant worry i felt like that period of my life was one constant panic attack and i seriously worked on myself made peace with some stuff from past and when last panic attack occured couple months ago i just said to myself i cant be like this no more and basicly numbed myself and life was pretty decent for last two months but as it always happens its all starting to come back and i became emotionless and detached.. Life feels too cold and lonley and my anxiety is still there in my mind but i cant express it..i feel like a bottle that is soon going to explode",

    "Could you read me? I consent to him so anal sex with me. When the violence was over and started the sex it was awful. It was the most unsatisfying experience Ive ever had. I couldnt believed what I just did. I just ruined the only healthy male relationship that I had for a disgusting experience. I still didnt remembered what happened with my brother, but I tried to repress this memory as well. I wasnt successful. ampx200B Me, at 16, didnt saw any good thing in life anymore, and the memory of the sex that I had with my cousin was still in my mind. In therapy, I accepted that experience but it just seemed that something was wrong. Of course, it was around my whole life so it was very obvious Im gay. Right, Im gay. Mom Im gay. Dad, Im gay. World, IM GAY. Now Im gonna be happy. Except that I wasnt. So I decided Im just gonna be happy when I kiss a man. I kissed. Three. And I hated. Once I kissed a girl, but she humiliated me in front of the whole class and said that was the worse kiss ever. The other girl I was interested rejected me totally. So I just said you what, Im gay. I dont fucking care. I surrounded myself with gay people, feeling that I would feel part of something for the first time. I didnt. I wasnt interested in any man, except the ones that treated me badly and bullied me. Those one were straight. ampx200B I lived for two years as a gay man, that has never felt so unhappy in my life. Empty. The memory of what happened to me and my brother started to rise inside my head. But neglected it and just said its normal, boys do that. It was until the last year. when I was making coffee. I accidentally let it fall in my brothers body and, of course, he started screaming with me. At that moment, I just cried like never before. Since I was 10 I didnt cried.",
    "I just don't care badly enough unless I'm in a crisis. Nothing is really interesting or exciting. How do I care enough ? I cant get myself to work on my resume. I cant get myself to apply to jobs. I cant get myself to look for a new doctor. I cant get myself to read a book. Im not even interested in planning a trip. Its all just whatever to me. I only do things if I HAVE to or if Im inspired by a strong emotion. Like if Im angry, Ill do something. But that wont last long. I used to be ambitious. I used to care a lot more. I used to have some sense of passion. Now  I see just how powerless Ive always been and how overall meaningless it is to care so god damn much. I understand I need to be providing others with something of value to get value in return. I understand that the more value I can give, the more value I get. Its just that whatever value I can get in return just doesnt really appeal to me. None of it is incredibly interesting or exciting. And even what I would classify as the most exciting  its not like I can accomplish it. I cant attract the type of life companion that I want because I wouldnt even date myself. I dont have the type of money as Bezos does to see Earth from space and its extremely unlikely I ever will be able to attain it, let alone attaining it ethically without harming others and by paying my fair share of taxes.

    "I’m not sure if it’s depression, I just see no point in living. This is my first post on Reddit and Im not really sure where else I can talk to. For the last 2 years or so Ive lived every day bored, and I mean bored as in bored of having no friends or people to talk to, bored of constantly feeling like shit and knowing Im causing the ones closest to me pain, bored of spending 40 minutes scared to leave the house because of how bad I look. Ive not seen a point in living for a long time now and people around me ask why Im so down or why I dont talk much and I just see no point, I know none of them care about me or care about the answer so whats the point in replying. Every night I go to bed I literally pray to god, even though I dont believe in him, that I die in my sleep as Im too scared to actually kill myself. I get so easily pissed off and pissed off at the fact I feel like this, I have so much more than most people and what most people could ask for and I just still feel like a constant shit bag always letting down others and as everyone around me says oh you have so much to do etc and youre only 17 none of it matters. I just hate every day as it goes on and theyre just all merging into one big day. I dont remember the last time I was genuinely excited about something or happy for something that I wasnt forcing myself to feel. I just want to be happy, its all I want. What can I do when there seems to be nothing that can make me happier.",
    "I'm begging someone for support rn. Anyone I was wholeheartedly convinced she was the woman I was going to marry. Eventually, after I had gone to jail, she decided to leave me and fucked 3 of my best friends... at the same time. It was complete betrayal, and thats when I realized I was truly alone. No friends, no family, it really fucked me up. Thats when my anxiety started to peak. The last few years of high school, I was addicted to cough syrup and would go to school tripping every single day. It destroyed my social skills, and fucked up my mind permanently. Eventually, after turning 21, I turned to alcohol. For the last 4 years, Ive drank basically everyday. Im at the point where I just hole up in my room, drinking around 18  20 drinks continuously everyday. Nothing is more terrifying than alcohol withdrawal. Ive gone to the hospital on numerous occasions for it, and every morning and night Im absolutely convinced Ill die of a heart attack. My 2nd gf I met 4 years ago. Finally, shed had it with my addiction and irrational behavior, and she left me. The thought of her being with another man crushes me, and Im at my lowest point. I cant stop drinking, havent showered in weeks. I have alcohol withdrawals constantly, and I cant even rid myself of the pain because when I start to drink again, its constant vomiting. I have nobody, and she was the only one that I had. Id call her at the end of everyday, and atleast I had someone to back me up. Ik its so cliche, but really she was my only hope. Im just really at the end, and just need someone to tell me it gets better. My life has been aweful since birth, and I just cant find hope. If you took the time to read this, I really appreciate it. I hope someone talks to me",
    "How do you, not only keep existing, but actually be productive, when you're depressed everyday? As someone who has chronic, but still functioning depression, its been a real struggle to be productive and better myself while Im depressed, which, unfortunately, is practically everyday for me. I usually do the bare minimum going to work, making myself look put together, etc. But, tasks outside of that tend to fall by the wayside, and I notice that Im not bettering myself or my future. I have looked this up before, i.e. how to do things when youre depressed and usually I come across articles that explain how to get basic things done and reminding the reader that the small stuff is important too. While I really appreciate this sentiment, I want to know, how do I not only exist with my depression, but also flourish? Like, doing things that will favor me in the long run? What do other people with depression do? Maybe some success stories would be helpful? also, a side note Im currently being medically treated for depression, so Im not really looking for specifically medical advice Thank you!",
    "Today would’ve been Mom’s 65th birthday After a couple of weeks of slightly improving mood and feeling, today has me right back where I started. Mom wouldve been 65 today. She and I were both looking forward to this because she wouldve qualified for Medicare today. And we couldve finally gotten some help for some of her issues and some caregiving relief for me. Mom passed two years ago and Ive never been quite ok since. Its funny how stuff such as transferring her from her bed to her chair, bandaging wounds, and even cleaning up accidents is stuff youd end up missing after they are gone. Just to have them back. All this is added to Mom and Is dog, Harper, had to be put down in June for kidney failure. My last family. So, now its just me. The sole survivor of being a family caregiver for 13 years, to sift through memories upon memories by myself. And the weight of today is just a lot. And its really taxing my anxiety and just putting me back in grief and darkness. They should both still be here.",
    "(TW: Suicide) I can’t stop thinking about my suicide attempt I attempted suicide earlier this year, and I cant stop thinking about it even though it was a while ago. I overdosed the day before my dads birthday I wasnt thinking about the fact that his birthday was tomorrow and was sent to the hospital at about 1am on his birthday my friend forced me to tell my dad what I did when I tried to vent to her about how much pain I was in otherwise shed call 911. Im glad she did. On the way to the hospital, my dad yelled at me for ruining his birthday and told me Im selfish and stuff for attempting suicide. He told me later that he did that because he was scared and didnt know how to react, but I still feel awful for ruining his birthday. He spent his birthday in a hospital with me. I cant stop thinking about being in the hospital and the mental hospital. It was horrible. Memories keep coming back to me and it makes it hard to sleep or focus. What should I do?",
    "Goal in life: not to feel suicidal Im a pretty solitary person. I rarely talk to anyone on or off this internet. I think Im happy with this. Ive tried the normal life for a couple years and have reverted back to my introverted, solitary ways regardless. Ive rarely felt happy or enjoy many things. Most of the time Im fairly blah. Im perfectly fine with this and I usually am pretty bored unless Im working on class work university engineering student so I am not bored often lol. I find most things boring, even video games most of the time which Im sad about bc I loved games growing up. ampx200B All of this, Im fine with but one thing. Thats feeling like I dont want to live anymore. It happens occasionally when Im stressed out or extremely frustrated. Its pretty much always bc of all of the schoolwork I have to do or an upcoming exam. My life is completely consumed by schoolwork which would be fine if I were comfortable in it, but Im constantly behind or dont understand stuff. So that just frustrates me more. The last time I wanted to die was about an hour ago. I was frustrated at having spent my 13th hour non consecutive on a homework assignment. I wasted two hours of my life sulking and looking up various ways to kill myself. Finally found one that doesnt make me scared. Its the one where you put a bag over your head but pass out from innocuous gasses like helium. ampx200B So what are some ways youve found to counteract these random depressions. Im a very pessimistic person so when people say enjoy the flowers or life is so awesome, I think thats really dumb in my opinion. That logic doesnt work for me",
    "I'm at my end point. I feel so alone and like no one cares about me, I have no one to turn to for reassurance or comfort in these very difficult times. Other people have friends and family but I have no one. Suicide phone lines dont help me one bit and besides, Ive called too much at this point and I consider myself a nuisance to them. Ive attempted to make friends but I always ruin it or theyre not interested and ghost me, let me tell you, being thosed or ignored is one of the worst feelings when youre lonely and trying to reach out for that human connection. I dont know whats wrong with my generation or society as a whole, it seems empathy has gone out of fashion with my generation or it went extinct.",

I know this because last winter I was clean for 3 months. I finally felt self love. I finally felt happy. I finally could smile. But then I selfsabatoged.. Ever since Ive felt horribly insecure and shameful 247. I constantly deny myself everything that brings me joy. I hide from the world. And I hide from my friends and family. I hate myself.

    "Debate on suicide Here are my arguments against all the arguments to not commit suicide. Id love some intellectual debate on this to help me reframe and try to stop feeling suicidal. 1. Committing suicide hurts the people you leave behind to that I say frankly, Im in so much mental anguish, that I dont care about that. When Im dead I wont be feeling any guilt, right? 2. Youll feel better soon ok but its been seven years of this emotional distress and its not getting better? Could someone please help me debate myself on my thoughts? Thanks!",
    "No One Cares So Why Should I? I am not great with conveying my thoughts but Ill try. I feel like no one cares whatsoever. All of my friends have others to hang out with, and honestly they probably enjoy each other more than being with me. On top of this, I dont really know how to tell people Im not doing well for a few reasons. I always seem to get short responses like itll get better or Oh and then its left at that. No one knows how to help me, which is fair I suppose, but after so many cries for help, Ive given up. No one knows how to help and surely it must upset or annoy them hearing about me having a bad time, so I decided to lie. I dont tell anyone how Im really feeling except on rare occasions. Even then, its not usually helped. Im so useless to everyone by being this way, so instead Id rather put on a mask and fake happiness, that way no one has to bother. I dont care about myself, I just want others to be happy and if that means ignorance then thats fine I suppose. I dont think anyone should do this, but I dont carry the same standards for myself as I do others. Im sure itll be bad but I just dont know what else I could do. I wish I could just be better but its impossible. Everything hurts in my heart so much that sometimes it makes me nauseous. I cant stand living around people who barely notice me. I allow myself to get used to make others happy. I hate it, but Ive decided its logical if it makes others happy. Instead of two people hurting, I just do, all the time. In this sense, Im like a doll. Im used for whatever purpose and then discarded afterwards. It hurts so bad, but I dont know anything else. Im worried about asking for help since I feel like I disappoint others when I cant tell them whats wrong, or if what they say or suggest doesnt help. I dont know what I need honestly. Sorry to be a bother.",
    "I don’t know what’s going on And then that summer I got my shit together, started training for soccer,and I thought I healed. But I guess I didnt because junior year here we are.

You know my ex, got over me so quick. She already found a prom date, and she and her best friend replaced me with another guy. Double replaced. This guy they replaced me with is annoying as hell though, but hes so much smarter and more athletic than me. I guess they did better than I did. Im just here alone, no one to have my back. I guarantee you, no one would give two fucks about me. No one thinks about me. No one is there to check up on me. I have no one. And its killing me. I thought loneliness was strenght, cus Kobe was lonely, and he became one of the greatest athletes of all time. So I thought me being lonely was gonna help.

At this point I have accepted she wont talk to me, that she will not come back to me and probably will never do so. However, I cannot accept never getting a chance with her again. In MarchApril she is leaving the country and I fear I will never see or talk to her again in person. All I need is to talk with her and some understanding. Though I know I have messed things up so bad. I have put so much stress on her. I have done everything wrong while I knew better, but still I did it. So far I have been diagnosed with MDD and Persistent Depressive Disorder PDDso a double depression, and they said I show signs of anxiety, bipolar disorder, and a personality disorder e.g. avoidant, dependent, antisocial, existential OCD. I am still at the early stages so I wont have a definitive diagnosis for a quite some time still. What is certain is that there is something really wrong with me. Most of it originates from my horrible childhood and upbringing. Only the MDD was actually caused by the breakup. Still, my ex thinks she and the breakup are the main causes of my current state, but that is simply not true. Of course, I cannot tell her as she wont speak to me nor believe me. ampx200B Now here is my dilemma I feel the pressure to move forward with my life. I feel like I have to take on all these life responsibilities again that I have to live my life to the fullest. I always felt like that, but because I keep overthinking everything I become this passive person who does only the minimum. I feel incredibly weak, pathetic, and scared to do almost anything, like a little kid in grown mans body. Even though I know I can do some things well, I just do not have any solid confidence. If I do nothing then my life wont get better and I will for sure never get back with my ex. Though I dont see the point of putting in all this effort to do things if it doesnt make me happy.",

I noticed that there is not a day that goes by without me thinking about all the horrible things that are happening in the world, all the terrible things that may and will happen to me, how Im hurting my parents by lying to them, how I should be ashamed of myself, and after I go on about this for some time I start to think about how I am selfish for indulging in my own thoughts and problems so much. I also have IBS. It used to be not very bad but these days I sometimes come very close to having a nervous breakdown because of how much pain it causes. I sometimes take almost freezing showers to stop the pain, because my body goes into were dying mode and blocks the pain from my bowels. I feel ashamed of myself. Im living a better life than 90 percent of the world. I dont have to worry about food, getting ill, getting killed or not having a shelter. I live in a clean home. I can take a shower whenever I want. Both my parents are still alive and well. But I dont feel okay. And whining about not feeling okay makes me feel very privileged. But Im not okay.

I was dreaming of becoming an electronics engineer. I always had issues with my gender identity, but it used to be not so bad. Its strange really. Back in the old days, people had a lot of life threatening problems. There were plagues, long and bloody wars, famine etc. I feel very privileged for feeling bad about my issues. And Im not the only one with these problems, and majority of the people in the world has much bigger problems, I know that. But they still try to keep going, but I cant keep going.

    "I ( 26 female ) have decided to take care of my severely depressed younger brother (20m ) by letting him move in with me last week and need some tips. Not exactly suicidal in that he does not intent to kill himself but he is fed up of living so could very well do something dangerous if this continues . I have been pestering my brother to move out of my parents for the longest time. He finally did last week and came to live with me. I congratulated him for taking the right steps. I told him he always has a place with me. And this is why I still took him in despite having reservations as I am not exactly where I want to be in my life financially either but I am doing better than him and better than before so I felt like its worth a shot  and still do  . He has never worked a single job because of his mental illness and because of my parents hostility. This past year I have focused a lot on healing from my own health issues had two surgeries and heart issues but I feel better than ever before and also getting over a breakup which is hard for someone like.me who tends to get reactive depression as a result of difficult life events . Im doing well at work, was recruited by my manager to follow into her foot septs and applied to a program at McGill university that my employer would pay for the purpose of developping my career at the hospital I work for. I work in admin and might work in management following this management succession program  if they accept me because even though I was recruited still waiting for acceptance letter . But it took me a long while to get to a place where I can be stable enough mentally to get back on track or at least try too. I have anxiety too  was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder  but I feel like its been under control the last few monrhs. Moreover , I have my own fears of failure as Ive had a difficult experience with school in the past even though I graduated highschool and college .. My brother is the sweetest person. He is 20, however never grew up or matured properly due to lack of socialization... Never experience love, only had friends before his teens and made virtual friends via his gaming on Xbox until this day...",

I just... dont feel optimistic about my prospects anymore. I dont even care about the debt, I cant see myself ever buying a house and I cant even bring myself to imagine having a so and kids. All I want to do is go to bed and not move from under the covers... I dont know when this even happened.

I tried so hard to phrase the question in the best, clearest, most polite way possible, because I was worried about being a burden. There were a few people who answered my question and were helpful but it got downvoted a lot, because someone reposted my post on a different subreddit made for making fun of people. And the repost got so many upvotes. It had people in the comments calling me retarded, and a fuckwit and stupid and just generally shitting on me. I wish I never posted anything, Im probably going to regret posting this as well. Im so completely crushed. Ive never been bullied this badly before. I dont trust anyone anymore. Ive used this new account to post this because Im so terrified of these people following me around on any different posts I make. I really thought that it was going to be a nice community. I wanted to make friends and get advice from people in the same situation as me.",
    "accountability buddies i need an accountability buddy on discord. i have been depressed fr as long as i can remember but later i cant do anything, i had periods like this in the past but now i am starting to get used to it and i hate it. we can make a server on discord, just for us two, a vent channel so we can dumb our thoughts somewhere, a to do list for each day, and encourage each other. Im sorry i am not sure how this works exactly but if you have any other suggestions you can add them. i would need someone extremely open minded though because i have been through a lot of unexpected stuff. of course i will try to help too. please reach out if you are interested in us helping each other. just keep in mind that i am looking for a friend not a partner so your sexuality should not matter thought i know straight men or lesbians feel more comfortable talking to girls in general and that is okay. i dont care about your race or gender or anything but i am kind of beat down of talking to so many strangers on reddit without actually building a meaningful connection with anyone so please leave sort of intro in the comments. thank you for taking the time to read this, even though i might be a bit awkward.",
    "Help with depression Hello everyone, This is my first time on reddit and my first time posting. I am sure many people face issues that are much worse than mine, but I dont know what to do anymore other than ask for help. English is not my first language so I apologise for any mistakes. For context I am 24 yo, female, with a stable job and a loving boyfriend. By all means I should be happy right? Well I started feeling more and more depressed a few months ago and so far, it hasnt changed. I dont feel like eating and have lost weight, I dont feel like going out or hanging out with people and I could literally spend my whole day sleeping which I did for the past two days, missing work, I often find myself crying for no reason and I dont enjoy anything anymore. My boyfriend is abroad for a while because of his studies, and so I am able to hide from him most of the time. But its getting harder and harder and I think he is starting to lose patience. Our last two conversations was him telling me that he is sick of me moaning every two days and crying for no reason. This is not the first time I have been depressed, and usually it follows something bad, but this time I feel like its all in my head and its Something that I cant get out of. Its starting to impact my job, my Relationship and everything else in my life... Do any of you have any advice for me? ampx200B Thank you for taking the time to read this post!",
    "What advise do you have for someone who is not functional anymore? I break down into tears every day. I get almost nothing done every day. I am doing nothing with my life and I cant make myself care enough to try to make it better. I get to the end of every day and realise yet again i have achieved nothing of substance. The worst part is going to sleep though. I feel even worse laying in bed at the end of the day. Someone spent about 24 hours with me recently and i am embarrassed to let them see that this is the way I am living. My vague motivations to do something might last a couple of hours or day but nothing ever comes to a worthwhile fruitition. So i spend yet antlother week where all i do is surf the internet and tidy the house. Im really scared because I am so close to giving up and i reallt dont see any of the rewards of making the effort to be worthwhile. And im so ashamed that this is the way i have been lovong for so long.",
    "I don't know what to do at this point other than end it. Nothing has helped so far. Just blamed me. I live with constant guilt. Whenever I make a mistake, I hurt myself. Consciously or not. I have scars up and down my arms and all over my fingers from stresspicking, and my shoulders and thighs and stomach are covered in selfharm scars. It does not matter if its a big mistake or a small mistake. I cannot deal with the guilt of fucking up even a little bit, so I hurt myself to punish myself. Its the only thing that makes me feel a little better when I fuck up. I have been sexually abused 3 times. The first instance started at the age of 10 and ended at the age of around 12. My childhood best friend had started acting really strangely, cutting me off for no reason and telling me he hated me and treating me like shit. Essentially, we made a trade I get to stay friends with him if I send him videos and pictures of myself. He never told me why he started acting this way. The second time was the worst one. There is serious background to this. I made a new best friend in 4th grade, and we have been super close ever since. We had a mutual crush on each other for years. In 9th grade, I couldnt handle the stress anymore, and set my suicide date as New Years 2017. By some stroke of luck, my best friend invited me to an Xbox party and talked to me all night long and distracted me from killing myself, and we confessed our feelings for each other that night and started dating on January 4th, 2017, during my 9th grade year. We have been together ever since. However, in 10th grade, he admitted to me that he had a fat fetish. I was mortified I was pretty overweight back then from stress eating, and had no self esteem, but I tried it out because I loved him. It was horrible. I told him we needed to stop doing that, and that I was going to get fit and lose weight. He then insisted that if I did that, he wouldnt love me anymore.",
    "The Story of This Year The male room mate out of the 2 that were sleeping together ended up finding another girl he liked and he spent a lot of time with her which left me and the girl to get very close. Now all these people I consider my close friends, but the girl and I became really close and spent a lot of time together. We were just friends, and thats the way I liked it. We would spend every night chatting and laughing and having a grand old time while my other roommate was off with the girl he liked. The girl he liked who studies nursing ended up leaving for placement. She had to move away for 6 weeks to study so he spent more time with us at the flat. I started getting more and more depressed, just little things getting to me and stuff playing on my mind. One of my biggest stresses were bills and money. Our first electricity bill was close to 700 and that was for one month. I was so stressed about the next one that it made me really depressed. About 5 months after the first bill, our second one was due. About a month before I knew we would receive it I tried my hardest to start looking for ways I could pay it in case it was as high as the first. I desperately were looking for jobs, I started thinking about selling my stuff and I couldnt think of anything. So I came to the conclusion that I might not be able to pay it, and that if I could, when the next bill came out I would have to do this all over again. So I decided it might be best for me to move back to college. I ended up telling my room mates and they werent happy about it, we got into a fight and upset me so much. I was so stressed and sad that I thought I couldnt take it anymore. So I went to my medicine draw and grabbed every pill I could find and took them. It ended up being about 70 different pills in total. After doing it I freaked out and called my house mates, they both had left to go to a party. The girl came home and rushed me to hospital while the other one stayed at the party to get drunk.",
    "Need Help I have this stupid habit to seek validation of my actions even though it has nothing to do with people. The choices I make I always try to seek validation of it. Just, for instance, I need to take an exam which is difficult and expensive and for like six months I am just asking around from family to friends whether I should take it or not. I think I just dont want to take responsibility for my actions thats why I dont have confidence in myself. I wish I could make my decisions with confidence and not seek validation from any family and friend.",
    "venting because i need to (somewhat nsfw based on this sub's rules) recently ive just been drinking to feel something because im numb to my depression but its to the point where my drinking makes me brutally aware of my depression. i cant use drinking or drugs to help me feel anything anymore. i shouldnt have in the first place. but im at a point where i want to go to self harm to feel something. even if its a created feeling that lasts a couple of moments. and ik at some point that wont help anymore and ill become helplessly numb. and im coming to the feelings of suicide like theres no point. when im happy its amazing but it comes down in a crash and all the sudden im just absolutely numb again. and i used to do a lot of art but even that doesnt help anymore and ive lost interest in everything.",
    "I wasn't diagnosed with depression So I spoke to a psychiatrist today. Ive been suspecting that Im depressed for years now. I have a hard time with really basic taskspersonal hygiene. I have no energy. I have really demeaning thoughts about myself, and my self esteem is extremely low. I think about dying pretty much all the time, and my suicidal ideation has greatly increased recently. I have no motivation and I cant see any kind of future for myself, let alone a happy one. Just generally, Im not happy at all. Now, the psychiatrist told me I have generalized anxiety disorder, and I was diagnosed with anxiety years ago, so that makes sense to me. But when I told him everything that I mentioned above and then some, he told me that these symptoms were not the primary focus, and that treating anxiety should make them go away. He never explicitly said that I have depression, which is throwing me off. Obviously Im not a professional, but the way he didnt actually name the reason for my symptoms is making me feel like such an idiot. I feel like all this time, Ive been making it up that Im not actually depressed and all my symptoms are just in my head. I just dont know what to do. I feel horrible about myself.",
    "We were engaged. He left me for a 19 year old he has been talking to online for the past 3 months This will be quite a long story, and I also apologize in advance for any grammar mistakes, Im Brazilian and English is not my first language. In 2017 I was 18 I met an American through an app called Yellow it doesnt exist anymore. He was 20. We talked for over two years before we got to meet in person. Our love grew and even though we didnt consider ourselves a couple because it would be crazy to start a relationship with someone that lives almost 10 thousand kilometers from you that youve never even met in person, we didnt have anything with anyone else in the meantime. To be honest though, he wanted us to assume ourselves as a couple back then, but I refused. We were always messaging, video calling and sending each other cards for special dates, so we could have something palpable. In 2019 I got my very first job was an internship actually, I didnt make much, but I saved all the money to buy a plane ticket to go there and see him. Important to mention that his parents didnt trust me enough to let him come here first, because theres this stereotype of people from third world countries wanting to marry people from rich countries just to get citizenship, so in order to prove I wasnt that type of person I had to go there first. I spent a long time trying to convince my parents to do so and also raising money for the ticket. Our mothers actually started messaging each other throughout the process, and that helped build some trust. Finally the day came, I got enough money for the ticket and bought it. That was one of the happiest days of my life. That was June 2019. We met on January 2020. The rest of 2019 I was just dreaming about the special day and I was so motivated I got the best grades ever at university. My life was perfect, I had nothing to complain about. So the day came. After almost 24 hours of flying and airport layovers, I was there. It was a feeling Ill never forget a mix of the good type of anxiety and victory for finally being able to meet the guy I loved. I stayed there with him from January to March 2020.",

    "How to tell my parents I think I’m depressed? So, Im a 15 year old boy, and I truly believe I am depressed. I have looked at symptoms online and have thought about them and I do have some of them at least I think so,and I at least want to get help and find out if Ive just been sad or truly depressed. However, I dont know how to tell my parents that I think I might be depressed. So, a little backstory. My grades have been slipping this year, and Im working hard to get them back up, but Im worried that if I say something about my feelings now, my mom will think its an excuse for my bad grades which it isnt, i should have been able to keep up with my classes. I also dont think she will believe me. I dont think I can actually convince her to let me get a diagnosis. If any of you guys have ideas on how to tell my parents, Id love to hear. Heres what Ive been thinking of doing sitting them down, telling them Im not joking with what Im about to say, and tell them how Im feeling. But again, I dont think my mom will believe no matter how hard I insist that I want help. So to reiterate, any ideas you guys may have on this are appreciated, and I want to hear your ideas.",

Im not being able to go, and have missed some classesthink Ill do today too because at the moment I wake up I get a horrible, sharp, piercing feeling of depression and I just want to stay in bed. I take 50mg of sertraline at 1000 and another 50mg at 1700. At night, at around 1800, I take 25mg of amitriptyline, and just before getting to bed I take 2mg of clonazepam. This type of depression doesnt seem natural to me and I suspect it might have to do with medication. Naturally, Im not going to talk to a.doctor when I can, but Id like to hear opinions on that. This is my first post here, hope Im following the rules",
    "SSRIs Rantseeking advice Ive been diagnosed with major depression and generalized anxiety disorder for 6 going on 7 years. Currently Im on 60mg nuzak to treat my depression. Ive been feeling like it doesnt work anymore. Ive said this to my psychiatrist, and ive tried to make appointments time and time again. She just doesnt get back to me. When I do have an appointment shes about 30 minutes late for a 30 minute appointment. Im just feeling incredibly frustrated with this. I get that shes busy and that life happens but its impossible to reach her. Im going to a new psychiatrist at the end of the month. Should I share these experiences? Should I share that I think my dosage is a bit high for not working well? Im nervous about this. I just dont want to feel dismissed again. I feel a little defeated.

After a few days of doing some good work and feeling good, Ill go right back to that negative mindset. Whenever I have this mindset, I feel like I dont even WANT to help myself get better because my brain is like oh, youll only be productive for a few days again anyway.

I got bored of playing bored games so I went to my room that Im sharing with my friend to just hang out. And when they were done with Games she just went upstairs to continue hanging out with them instead of me. I always feels so replaceable. Were going on a hike near cliff tomorrow. Guess where I might go. This is it all just because what I just said. Its also me feeling so replaceable by other people. Feeling like I always have fake friends, feeling like I can never trust anyone. I just want to feel cared about, I do have a boyfriend, Who is always saying he loves me, but sometimes I just dont trust it and I just dont know if hes telling the truth. I always feel annoying. Same with my family, I can never tell if they really do love me.

I just fell worthless, helpless, dumb, ugly, all the worst things, but I cant explain why. I feel like my life is pointless and I dont know what could give me a point. Now I start to think that Im just losing my money on therapy, because all I do is crying infront of woman that asks me questions I cant answer. Should I keep going? What should I do? And when I find answer why I feel so, I dont think it will help. How understanding what I feel, will help me with feeling?",
    "How to get over feeling like a disappointment and failure? I graduated from university about a month ago with a degree in acting and creative writing. Always was told to pursue my passions, so I did, and I was extremely pleased with my college career. I performed every single semester I was in school and wrote so. Much. Stuff I am so proud of. But now that Im out of school I feel like a disappointment. My family is supportive of my choice in study but it feels like theyre scared Im not going to have a career or get a job with my degree, that Ill always be in financial trouble and live the life of the starving artist.

Never has my brother been pervaded with the number of, what if..., what will you do...., backup plans... Just cant help but feel like going for what little I actually enjoy doing only allowed me to set myself up as a failure. I wish being in the arts in America was a respected career choice instead of being seen as majoring in unemployment Yes someone has told me this A career in the arts is very difficult but not impossible, and it takes a lot of time to get anywhere in such fields, but my family doesnt see that and Im treated like a kicked puppy.

    "Has anyone else experienced anything like this? Ive been dealing with depression and anxiety for nearly five years now but recently been dealing some stuff I havent experienced before. Ive been having thoughts that I feel like i cant control  not all the time but a lot. When it happens i feel out of control and like I cant stop thinking. Normally those thoughts are desperate or self loathing and sometimes its suicidal not active. I feel like someone is injecting thoughts into me and that Im just kinda there as those thoughts are happening unable to stop it. Ive also been having weird dazes where I feel like Im just doing everything on autopilot. I dont really know how to describe it honestly except sometimes I feel like Im thinking nothing at all, or sometimes it goes hand in hand with those racing thoughts. A couple of times when this happened at college I would be walking around campus but didnt feel like I was really there. I dont know whats going on but I feel very out of control and im worried.

Rant I probably think this way because as a child I watched my family overwork themselves, working multiple jobs to support me and my siblings, just to go home and be miserable. Mental illness kept them from being happy as a child, they never had the time to be happy as an adult, and being elderly is driving them to madness.

    "I study at university and things have become EXTREMELY difficult Im a university student and recently things have become really tough. There are several problems that Ive got no idea how to solve 1. Social anxiety its insanely stressful for me to interact with people. My classmates are girls and Im the only guy in the group so it makes interactions even harder cause I try to be nice with them. Sometimes I get random panic attacks dizziness, increased heartbeat, sweaty and trembling palms that make it impossible to talk to anyone or even to keep up with what the teacher is saying during lectures. Moreover, I cannot even approach my crush, cause this girl is very cute and adorable 2. Irritated bowel syndrome this thing makes my life like ten times harder. I have to endure extreme pain all the time and I also often get late for classes. Recently one of my teachers hes not aware of this problem has told me that he wont let me in for the class if I get even a minute late ever again. IBS  panic attacks also make things like public speaking extremely difficult 3. Conscription the main reason I study at university is to avoid it. For me conscription is constant beating, humiliation, shitty food, life without sleep and weekends and being in a tough environment 247. My health is not good enough to endure conscription, I just wont stand it. Also if Im gonna have a girlfriend, she is not gonna wait for me to return. Most girls here break up with their boyfriends if those get conscripted. There are several other problems like studying in the faculty that I dont like but cannot change faculty because here its almost impossible. Psychological help is also very expensive and mostly useless here so for me its not an option. What am I supposed to do to solve it? How can I make this life better?",

    "I feel like a failure, because I'm failing to get certain things done I am really struggling with certain aspects of my life, I cant get motivated. I am diagnosed with depression and anxiety and have been receiving various forms of therapy for the past two years since my son was born. I believe that I have suffered with depression since way before my son was born but the signs werent recognised until I was being seen by a health professional regularly. I am very lucky to have a roof over my head, a loving husband and a full time job. However, I cannot seem to escape the void of depression. Currently Im in a the crippling pit, and I cannot motivate myself with certain things. I dont take my medication, I know I should but I have some sort of mental block that stops me taking it. My work is suffering because Ive found a way to get by, doing the day to day tasks but not doing my daily reports. I would describe myself as high functioning depressed as I can get out of bed and get dressed, but the only reason I do this is my son. I live with my husband and in laws and Ive just realised that Im not happy anywhere. Im not happy at work, Im not happy at home. I get on well with my in laws but they drive me crazy by parenting my son. At work I feel out of my depth and like Im just winging it, badly. I just want to escape, and the only way I can think of to escape is suicide but I cant bear the thought of not seeing my son grow up. He is my lifeline but what kind of mother is he growing up with? I cannot motivate myself to tidy up after myself, only my son. I cant motivate myself to take my meds, check in with my therapist, or complete my work properly.

    "Drowning in my own tears I F22 am a reserved person and never really had a positive or functional family life. My dad died when I was 10 and my mom youngest of her family never really moved on from that and has always been dependent on other people. My childhood home was foreclosed and at age 18 I lived in a crusty trailer park with her for three years. Finally out now, but the deep emotional turmoil is still with me. Its been a long journey to accept and let go of grief and constant longing for a protective nurturing positive figure. My current boyfriend of 2 years and 4 months has been there for me more often than Id like to admit to get me out of that trailer park to finally start living on our own. And were finally doing that and for that Im very grateful. But its been obvious that I am still emotionally dependent and needy. Ive had over sixteen weeks of therapy and its helped a lot but this is the hardest obstacle Ive had to tackle with myself, trying to build resilience and harden myself like my partner has. We had a long talk tonight basically about what wed change about each other. He said he feels like my parent sometimes and that he can only rely on himself and maybe 2 other people, sometimes. But not me because Im not in a fully realized independent position yet. To be honest that struck me like an arrow. I already told him if he feels like he has to act like a parent, Id rather him not act at all. I dont want to be constantly coddled or comforted, and I told him its not fair to assume he can only rely on himself if he doesnt give me a chance to. We ended this conversation on a good note that we both have to make changes and now hes hanging out with our friendsroommates but for the past 3 hours Im still upset and crying in the room I told him I needed space. Why is letting go so hard for me. Why is it when I feel this shitty and keep thinking about my dad that I have to be the most alone. Its been over 12 years but I feel like I cant move on like my mom hasnt and one of my biggest fears is ending up like her.",
    "I'm truly stuck - can't quit, can't work. Can't get out of bed. Desperate for any advice. Im a grad student and Im suffering from depression. My progress has been slow in the last one year and my relationship with my PI is strained. Even before this pandemic, I was barely managing to do anything. Im in a different country and my visa depends on my PhD. It was my dream to do it. Even against my familys wishes, I secured funding and it was wonderful. I dont know what to do. Im really slipping. I cant seem to do anything with regard to work. But I cant seem to do anything else either. All the time I dont work, I spend feeling guilty about not working. I feel like a rat, which gets a shock if it goes right and gets a shock if it goes left at the end of a T . So its stuck. I am running out of time to finish this degree. Im making progress in therapy and even doing it several times a week. But its not helping me change my present. I wont get an opportunity like this again and see it slipping out of my hands. It makes me feel like an unreliable, irresponsible person. I dont want to be that person. I dont want to selfsabotage. I try my best everyday. I sit down to work. My therapist even said I was the most diligent patient hes met. Please point me to something. Anyone. Ill do anything.",
    "Skipped school to kill myself, didn't go through with it, what now? Please help me, anyone. Hopefully this all makes sense, confused and tired right now, and Im going to not go through and reread anything like I usually do as I know I would probably just end up deleting this post, so hopefully this isnt too confusing. Itll also be long probably, sorry for the long read, but I need to at least get down all of what happened. Just need some advicesupport, or whatever please, Im not really sure what I need, like I said, Im not in the best state of mind currently. ampx200B Ive skipped school maybe 56 times this year when things were too much, as school is one of my biggest stressors and I dont even see the point sometimes, just to get a mental break. Ive never done much on those days other than lie around, or maybe play some video games if I felt like it. These were the worst days for me, constant suicidal thoughts since my parents and brotherssister wouldnt be home, either at school or work. These are the days that I kept toying with the idea, feeling safe in a weird way, I know that I could kill myself if I needed to. I havent skipped for about a month or so, but all throughout yesterday I was thinking as I get closer and closer to graduation, theres a time limit of sorts on when Im actually going to go through with it, as it gets closer and closer I feel more pressure that I have to do it, because I feel like I need to kill myself before I graduate high school, Im not sure why. Today I woke up at 630, and as soon as I got up I was already battling with the idea of whether or not to go to school, and this thought stayed with me throughout breakfast, throughout my shower. I told my brother, who I normally walk to school with, that my alarm woke me up late and that hed better walk to school ahead of me if he didnt want to be late, so he left. I literally did nothing for the next 30 minutes to an hour, literally felt nothing, just thinking about what I was going to do.",
    "Where to go and how to get diagnosed. For years Ive gone through what I self diagnosed as episodes of depression. They usually last about a month or two of being super down and not having any drive to do anything at all. Im 21 now and it has been this way since 15 years old. When I was 17 I told my mom I was depressed and I told my guidance counselor in high school. Nothing came out of that except they sent me to a doctor to get blood drawn for some reason and I was sent on my way because the counselor said maybe I have a thyroid issue. Terrible counselor and terrible doctor. Never went back. Not blaming my mom either I just think she doesnt really understand what Im saying I feel. Ive talked to her about it a lot and she usually just tries to support me and tell me things will get better or youre just in a rut right now. Which can sometimes piss me off. But she is in no way doubting me or anything like that. She even told me to go see a therapist or doctor. But I dont know where to go or even how. Who do I go see to get a diagnosis? I dont want to be brushed off again. Instead of trying to self analyze my problems and try to treat them my own ways Id like to finally get closure and see if I really am depressed, or something else, or just dramatic.",

It started out as episodes of sobbing crying a lot and then I started having episodes of obsessiveinstrusive thoughts in December 2018. I started having thoughts of suicide this year. They started as instrusive thoughts and now they bring comfort. I live in a small town, surrounded by other small towns and there arent many options when it comes to mental health. I do have a GP that I really like and trust and my insurance pays for 1 check up a year and that is this Thursday. I want to talk to her about my depression and what I should do.

    "My problems are ruining my relationships. (I’ve also realized that I really don’t like myself.) Like a month ago Ive met a girl and weve been texting every day since then. She has a very good influence on me. My problems stress, sadness, anxiety etc. are getting easier to deal with thanks to her. But feeling better naturally comes with worrying about losing this goodness... a lot... I worry about losing her so much that its probably not having a very good impact on our relationship... Even though I feel better that doesnt mean Im totally fine. I still get these waves of insert any of my problems here. We very often argue when this happens. Im extremly worried that this will end up ruining my relationship with her. She will not like me anymore if I keep having these waves... Yesterday we were talking and she brought up how I have very low selfesteem. She wanted to help so she recommended something that has helped her with her selfesteem issues. Go to a mirror and say I love myself. I was almost unable to do this... I mean I said it but I didnt belive it and it made me feel way worse because I didnt think it was THIS BAD... Then I realized how much I dont like myself... Ive felt like shit because of that since yesterday. Its getting better today, thankfully. She probably isnt too happy about having to deal with me in these situations... Im not sure what to do... I really dont want to lose her because of this... I hope someone has some good advice for this...",

Its been roughly a year, I recently moved out of my parents house around this time last year. And its all gone to shit... I guess I rushed into adulthood faster then I should. Was promised a job from my mother in law. That only lasted 3 weeks. Ive been bouncing from warehouse to warehouse job for the last year. I feel disconnected from my own life. Worthless... like I dont belong. My relationship with my SO is rough. Theres days where its the ideal relationship, and days where I feel like Im the only one loving and actually trying. My relationship with my own family is little to none. I dont have the courage to say whats really going on. Idk I would rather people not care about me. Not worry or pressure me about whats going on. But Im at the end of my road and my last options are dark. I cant keep a job, cant keep a place, cant hold a conversation with family and friends. Im so numb and hollow. I cry randomly throughout the day, suicidal scenarios play out in my head all throughout the day. What if I wasnt around? People wouldnt have to worry. I wouldnt have to live a life I feel like I dont deserve. Ive contemplated actually doing it numerous times. Just cant choose on how and where as in stuck babysitting majority of the days. I feel like Im rambling all over the place but its how I am at this point. I have no structure in life. My schedule consists of doing everything for everyone else and then sleep. I feel useless and more importantly worthless.",
    "I feel lost and disappointed in myself Im 23F I went to a 4year after high school, for 2 and a half years, struggled to find friends and did terribly in school but I stayed nonetheless??? I regret that so much because I spent most of my time sick because I had no one to take care of me. I continued going there for 2 and a half years? When J was almost miserable thinking it would get better.. i had a close friend there who eventually didnt want to be my friend anymore and I felt so alone away from my family. No one cared about me, why did I stay? Eventually I left of course, but why did I continue to go there for 2.5 years when I wasnt performing well and didnt fit in with people at all? Is this the same reason people stay in abusive relationships? Now, 23 years later, after working and going to community college, Im transferring this fall. I thought I would be able to get a second chance at college but this pandemic happens and my classes are online. I still feel so much abandonment after my friend left me in college. I felt like I put so much into them, and they left me. I feel like Im disappointing my family because they had high hopes for me, but I still havent proved myself to them. Im just so lost in my life.",

    "I can’t go more than 5 minutes without crying These last few weeks have been the hardest in my life. After covid cleared out college campuses and my partner and I were forced to go back home my boyfriends family told him since he was back living under their roof he would have to follow every one of their demands. In the town where we go to college we were seeing each other multiple times a week. And the week before we were booted we spent every hour together. As soon as we got home his family told him he could no longer see me. I understand we are in a pandemic but we had been swapping spit even that same day they told him to quarantine. If he had anything I definitely had it and vice versa. I agreed to two weeks not seeing each other, not knowing how hard it would be. Even after that ended they didnt want us to see each other because during that time my state issued a stay at home order. I have not been able to see friends obviously and my family is abusive and toxic there isnt a single day in the house that there arent screaming matches. I lost my motivation to do any of my classes that went online. I stopped eating, I started drinking, and taking pills in incrementing amounts hoping I would gather the courage to kill myself. I started cutting myself so I could distract myself from the emotional pain. All I do is lie in bed, and get water once a day. I cry so often starting as soon as I wake up, and even more so at night. I havent been able to sleep well, sometimes at all. I only fear this situation is going to get worse and it feels like there will be no end. It was a shock to come from months of being with my person so happy to have it all stripped away so suddenly. If anyone has any tips that would help me, Id appreciate it.",
    "I'm at the end of my ropes Please dont try to convince me to try more meds or therapy. Ive been trying for 12 years to find something that works and Im just 23. Ive also been to different therapists and have tried many types of therapy, the most recent ones being systematic therapy and CBT. Nothing has worked so far. I have stopped looking for a cure, I know it doesnt exist. But I need new ways to cope with my depression because my old coping techniques are no longer working. I have tried meditation too but seems like it does nothing for me. The only ways I could cope with my depression were doing something creative like painting or drawing and listening to music. I no longer enjoy creating things and listening to music and Ive been left without hope because every day I keep getting worse and theres no way for me to cope with my depression anymore. So heres the question, what do you guys do when you feel like doing nothing besides sleeping? I am literally not in the mood for doing anything and its tearing me apart because Ive spent the last few months of my life just being a leech and a parasite and doing nothing and its taking a toll on my mental health thats already damaged badly enough.

But I pushed them away because i habe major trust issues because if my past. But they dont seem to be that interested which I can understand but it still hurt. And I do found a nice group of two peps to chill but of course they arent always available and even if Im hanging out with them I tend to feel lonley thinking about my past and stuff, not always tho it mostly happens when I see other friend hanging around questioning why they didnt invite me. Or why other friends dont look out for me. I know everyone has a life and is busy but why cant I be a part of it. I mostly think its my fault but I dont think always like that.

    "Am I Disabled Enough? I latch onto my own escape in the form of my high school boyfriend. Im eighteen, 140 kilos and move out of the room I share with my sister into a unit with my boyfriend who, you probably guessed it, was abusive. over time he conditioned me to stay away from technology but the tv and Xbox, cut what few friends I had out, only family I could really see without some sort of manipulative guilt trip was my mother because shed drive me straight into his arms. He had control of everything, finances, time, everything. so now Im twenty three, married and pregnant with my first child. completely isolated and dependant. Police come aknocking when Im two months from birth and low and behold turns out my guy isnt a great fella. He had child exploitation on his Pc and planned to harm my daughter once she was born, sending photos and ultrasounds to prove intent. Oh but dont worry cause mummy was there to pick me up. I escape her when Im 24 and bubs nine months old for my own house but i dont fully shake her free until two years after that. Obviously as from all the above, I am not a mentally stable person. For my daughter I start to try and sort myself out. until my daughter is five, I took those years to do some inward looking and healing. I go to therapy, I find a antidepressant that works, I clip out the bad and keep only those positive influences. I have Depression, anxiety and PTSD. I have a medical diagnosis of only the Depression so far but the others are being worked on in therapy.

    "This is a cry for help... I wanted her but she was into me too? I spent a week chatting with Jane on Instagram. She was absolutely amazing. So, sick of depression and everything, I took a leap of faith. I dropped out of college and moved back to my hometown. A few days later, I heard jane broke up with that asshole because of me. I started dating her and we dated for 2 months. Finally, I was happy after a long time. I was living in heaven. She was so perfect that I was finally happy for a short time in my entire fucking life. I totally forgot about my ex girlfriend and fell in love with Jane. Note Jane is one month older than me. I lost my virginity to her. We had sex for 3 times when we were dating. So I became kinda attached to her, you know? I loved her and she loved me sooo much. We couldnt get enough of each other. Something to add, she was extremely jealous. I thought that was really cute and adorable cause it shows that she cared for me but, our relationship got toxic. She fought with me a few times about those 3 girls I dated in the past! I explained to her that they meant nothing to me and our fights ended with her saying I love you One night she told me she loved me so much. But if she sees that Im flirting with other girls and stuff, she will breakup with me cause she cant tolerate that. I kissed her and told her that there is nothing she needs to worry about. And I meant it. I was 100 loyal and honest to her. But one time one of my friends girl from my excollege commented on one of my Instagram posts miss you. The next day, I realized Jane flirt flirted with a few guys. I asked her what the fuck was going on, and she said I started it. I was heartbroken, told her that was a misunderstanding, and she apologized, which I accepted. But, I was heartbroken cause I couldnt believe Jane wasnt loyal and committed to me.",
    "I don't know why I feel this way I pulled out my notepad and no words come out of me. I tried putting myself in front of my piano, but I cant bring myself to even play a full piece. The one that Ive tried is mediocre at best. I cant pick up a book. I cant bring myself to enjoy the foods I eat. I dont even know why I feel this way. There is no reason for me to feel this way. I have a roof over my head, a loving family, and supportive friends, yet why do I feel this way? There are people that say they love and care for me, but why cant I bring myself to pull up the phone to say Hi? I know theyd reply back, but I dont know why I cant do it. There is a voice in my head that says they hate you. They never cared for you. They only tolerate you because they see you as a sad being. I know its not true, but why does my mind work against me? And now, Im lying on my bed. I dont even want to do anything. I just want to lie down and try to sleep. I cant even do sleeping right. Sometimes, I sleep too much. Sometimes, none at all. And all I could do to shut my thoughts to play is some mindless video or song. But I never really enjoy it. The saddest thing for me is... I thought I already survived it. Ive been out of my medications for two years now, and yet, here it comes again. I dont like feeling this way. What does it feel like to not have a noisy brain that feeds me with depressive thoughts? Its like every waking moment of my life, it has something to say. And I hate it. I just want to feel genuine happiness again.",
    "I don’t want to take out my negative feelings on my bf Ive been struggling with depression, PTSD, anxiety, and anger issues for a while now, and I keep feeling down and I dont know how to not take out my anger at my bf by getting snappy with him or saying something kind of mean. He knows all about it and hes been super patient with me, but I know its not something that should continue, regardless of him being alright with it at the time. So Im not sure what to do",
    "Well, it happened Following my last post. It happened my closest friend is gone, I dont know what I did wrong, I dont know how to deal with it and I dont know what to learn from it. I tried the best I could for this not to happen, but once again my heart is left broken, two of the people who made me the happiest in life are both gone, Ill never be able to chat with them again... I cant deal with that right now, corona, uni, distance, friends going, me hating myself, I cant deal with all of this crap anymore. Im tired of living Im tired of faking it to everyone Im tired of being tired. This is unfair, I want to be greedy and just let myself be at peace, but with that Id bring pain to others, and I dont want them to feel like I do right now.. Ive been cutting myself to ease the feelings, which is helping but I have nothing more and its becoming addicting. Any help or just support in general is appreciated, love all of you, thanks in advance.",

Despite living with family, I spend most of the time home alone because of different schedules and conflict between people. I try to reach out to friends, but theyre all busy living their life.

    "Both me and my spouse are depressed Then if there are any people, dogs, noises, or wind, he starts to panic, so I do too, he usually helps stabilize my moods, but were both afraid of people so it turns into a feedback loop. Hes house trained because most of the time, even when I get him hyped up to go outside and put his leash on, he just freezes at the door and refuses to go outside, and if I pick him up and put him down on the grass he just stands there. We live in a trailer park and our yard is about 10 feet wide, so theres no privacy. We both are hermits and dont like interacting with people and Im autistic so I just... cant converse verbally normally. We have no friends locally even though weve been here for a few years. I just got out of a bad friendship and at this point cant really be bothered to try to have another friend in fear Ill get myself in the same situation. On top of everything, Im going through an existential crisis and find no comfort in my hobbies I used to enjoy. Neither of us really do anything. We play video games and I draw, but thats about it. I have suicidal tendencies but havent tried for a while, but have been close to downing pills again. He isnt suicidal per se, but when hes at work he gets thoughts akin to ideations, but when were together were both fine. At this point, I honestly dont know what to do. Sure, theres plenty of stuff to be done, but I have issues prioritizing things, so I just see this long list and get overwhelmed and end up doing nothing. Our pets and plants still get cared for, and I can do some house chores our place is a fixer upper to say the least, but most of the day I just sit in paralyzing existential dread. Im too dead set on rationing my medicine from trauma that I either wont allow myself to take my sedatives even when I should or am scared that Ill have the urge to eat them all and kill myself. Dont overdose, kids, it aint as romantic as the movies make it out to be. It just feels hopeless.",

I am a highschool student I am taking concurrent classes at our local college and the teacher, an adjunct professor, is very rough on highschoolers and she expects a lot from them. This is fine but were fast approaching the end of the year and my grades are slipping due to some stress and dysfunction in my family and friendships that I am struggling to deal with. I also have to miss a lot of class for highschool events and such. There is a possibility I will not graduate and that I will lose my scholarships for college.

    "Am I pathetic? I moved 1,000 miles away from my hometown to live with my boyfriend a year ago and Ive been miserable since. I love my boyfriend with everything in me, but I have a very, very close relationship with my family and the distance is killing me. I practically raised my sister theres a 10 year age gap, so I feel like I abandoned my child or something, even though shes old enough to be more of my friend now. I miss living in a very small town I live in Miami now, and just being close to everyone. My relationships with my family are slipping and it makes me hate my life. My boyfriend refuses to live anywhere that isnt urban especially somewhere as rural and uncultured as my home, and theres no cities within a 4 hour distance from my hometown, which wouldnt help at all. Idk what to do, I cant imagine my life without my boyfriend, but I cant imagine living like this without my family near me for much long either. Am I pathetic for being so close to my family and not having the strength to put effort into building a life separate from them?

But then the reality of having two kids and a fairly oblivious husband creeps back in. I tell him how Im feeling, but it always feels like he thinks Im just whining or feeling sorry for myself. He kind of helps with the kids,but usually I have to ask. I am getting to the point where I feel like if I have to ask for help with the same shit every day, it isnt even worth it to ask. Ive also explained that to him. Things get better for a few days, maybe a week, then we go back to me having to ask again. I love my husband and kids, but Im at a breaking point.

    "Hi, Im fighting my way out of my depression but it is hard. Need tips on how to motivate myself again. Hi everyone, Im a uni graduate, 7 months out now but no job to show for it, a lot has gone down since this time, and id like to go through it if you can be patient with me. Before I left university everything was going well, i had just come back from an internship i had in China, I had a loving girlfriend, I graduated very well from a top universuty. And i was prepared to move forward with my life. But i think it has all gone wrong. First, I had a depressive spiral in my teens that i recovered from before, i had an L4 spinal fusion and spent 6 months recovering in bed Though snuck out to debate in parliament, take that doctors!!. Left alone with my thoughts, and my friends moving away to university. I sunk into a depression that nearly culminated in me killing myself. Though i fought my way out and tried to better myself. My girlfriend left me for another bloke, i got really ill and lost a lot of muscle i grew after my surgery and became skinny fat. And my Best friendship broke down after he threatened and tried to cut me with a knife A whole Mentally ill saga that would take pages and pages to explain.. And moved back to a struggling home with physicallymentally ill parents that dont know how to support me emotionally Not their fault!! they do try their best by me. All of which contributed to me sinking into a depression in October, i fought my way out and applied for a range of different jobs and schemes. But didnt get on any of them. This caused another spiral that lasted till February. Ive been fighting my way out though, i was seeing a therapist but covid killed that, and was taking antidepressants but they made things worse. Ive substituted them with Physical exercise. I run 10km every 6 days out of a week, and am blasting my skinny fat spots. And am learning new things with online courses and reading books that help give me meaning like Aristotle, Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus and Neitzche which helps give me purpose.",

    "Should I kill myself? I am the most uninteresting person and I feel like I am the only one who puts effort into any of my relationships. I slowly got more and more awkward and struggled more and more to reach out. Once highschool started, I did make a small group, but it was honestly super toxic so I had to break free. I couldnt deal with the constant threats and judgement. I left hating myself though and feeling out of place and like a loser. This went on for a while where I had one friend. Untill the end of grade 11, I got to this point where I thought maybe I should just end it, and that was just what I thought every moment. I was so close to doing it but these couple girls in my class started reaching out to me and pulling me along. I didnt tell them anything of course but they would just joke around with me and one of them was super flirty though I didnt read it at the time. I started to get to this happy high in my life, then I met a girl on a bus who sorta signaled for me to talk to her. We ended up dating for almost 2 years. Now one of the girls I met in class, Ill call her Angela, is a friend to this day. Throughout grade 12 we spent everyday together, we would always be togrther at lunch, or between classes. I met a lot of friends through her though, some of them I didnt vibe the best with. A lot of them were suspicious that we were dating, and her guy friends got jealous of me. So they started telling her I wasnt trustable and its sort of weird that we are so close even though I have girlfriend. But, I just vibed better with girls I found. She would rant to me, I would joke around with her, it was a fun friendship. We didnt text at all though so once we werent able to spend so much time together it got complicated. Ill get back to Angela later. My ex, the girl I dated from april grade 11, to december 2019, the end of my first semester of university. Ill call her Kayla.",

    "I’m tired of pushing forward. When my wife came home she seemed concerned but didnt really know how to react. She sort of pushed me away and told me to sleep it off. In the morning I wasnt any better and I didnt have the energy to get out of bed. My wife called my mother to come help and she did a decent job of making me feel better but I felt embarrassed about it. After she left I was disappointed that my wife wouldnt hug and just sit with me and instead just push for me to be back to normal. After this incident I definitely havent been as open about my thoughts because I know she doesnt really care or rather doesnt know what to do. I have noticed that recently when we argue I will have moments where I want to react in self harm. This comes usually around the time when my wife and I go into a the quiet part of our argument when everything has already been said but we havent come to a resolution yet. In both in a state of calm anger. In this time I always want to bang my head against to wall or take a kitchen knife to my arm. In the past I would tell my wife about these thoughts but it came across as me trying to manipulate her by threatening self harm so I know not to bring it up anymore. At this point I feel like Im in a downward spiral. I want to go back to when I put care into myself. When I gave my all every day. Now I feel like an empty shell pretending to live a happy life. By now both my mom and sister know its a facade but I cant admit to it. I was able to power through it and make my wife and son my reason to live, not just an excuse , but a real reason to push forward but now I feel like Ive lost steam. What can I do to help myself?

    "I could use some help figuring out if there‘s a possibility I‘m suffering from depression This could turn out to be kinda long so I apologise in advance if anyone wants to read this. Long story short Im not sure if Im actually depressed or just imagining things. So, this took quite a lot for me to post this and I will try my best to describe my situation. Some general information Im 15M and have like a lot of germans been at home for homeschooling for almost a year know except for a few months where we went to school in person. To be honest I dont really know when things started but I was talking to a friend of mine videochat about a month ago and after he asked I explained to him how I was feeling. When I was done he said something along the lines of Hmm that kind of sounds like some depression you got there. Now to what I told him I think I stopped expressing how I feel at any given time at least a year ago and since covid took hold things have only gotten worse. I cant remember the last time I cried tbh i felt like crying pretty often lately or truly told anyone I wasnt doing too well. I always pretend Im happy and everything is normal so neither my parents nor my friends start worrying about me. One thing that really bothers me is that every time my friends who I 200 trust ask how Im doing I tell them fine. The conversation with my friend was an exception i guess. I want to explain it to them SO bad but somehow I keep stopping myself. A minor thing that might be worth mentioning is that I unfortunately remember practically every single mistake in my only relationship I ever had with a great girl I am not really over yet, friendships and in general ALL THE TIME. I always have to distract myself with something because every time Im left alone with my thoughts I go down the good old Why did I do that? Why would anyone do that? Whats wrong with me? Does heshe still remember that? road. School is almost insufferable because it leaves me a lot of time to think to myself and unfortunately its rarely happy thoughts.

    "I feel my life is worthless, I'm ready to end it all, please help me. I've posted for help, and I don't know where to turn to now. I feel more depressed now than ever before in my life. It became like an addiction to me. For weeks upon weeks Id go to different nightclubs, and bar hop night after night after work, I didnt just savior my time there I indulged in it, there Id hook up with women looking for more than just fun. For some reason during this time I was able to hook up with a few local black chicks thatd be hitting the club scene, never in my life did I ever think I as a blond ass kid from Pensacola would I be hooking up like this, most of the times after drinking, and chatting with them, wed hang out in my car, and have some fun in a parking lot wed drive to, and spend a few hours at, during this time Id never use protection, maybe it was the combination of being drunk, or dazed but at that time I just didnt care. During this time I met this hot black chick with an afro, well call her Mandy, and after dancing with her at a nightclub late one night we really hit it off, but after my typical one night stand, this girl was different. We grew to have a connection, as days went by we started getting flirty over texts, and soon I grew to have a secret relationship with her, while my wife knew nothing about it. I even took several business trips to her place during this time. Every time I went it was well worth it. At first she was very sweet to me, and considerate, we even smoked pot together, which for me was a first. Finally for once in my life I thought I had found the perfect work life, sex balance. Id wake up, say bye to the kids, go to work, afterwards let loose at the clubs till 3am, come back while the wife is asleep, and so on. And finally with Mandy in the mix, I had someone to actually connect to when I wanted. Unlike my wife she was in her early 20s, my wife late 40s, Ive seen garbage fires that look better than her.",
    "Family crises She swears they didnt do anything sexual. Im kinda losing my shit right now..... Ive always been suicidal. My mom caught me in 5th grade trying to kill myself.

So she talked to her family about what happened and they all have her confidence. I dont have any family here, nowhere to go when things get rough. Shes just acting like nothing happened.

We have a phone conference scheduled for Wednesday. I couldnt sleep last night, my heart has been beating out of my chest, I cant relax, and my breaths are short but frequent. So far its not let up, Im sitting in an empty church parking lot right now. I wanted to post this to get it off my chest and maybe give me relief? The feelings of suicide are very strong right now, but I could never do that to my boys. I have no where to turn, and I dont know what to do about it. All I can do is think of how much of a piece of shit I am to push her to this point which isnt helping my already venomous thoughts about myself..... I dont want a divorce, but Im so upset, I cant even look at her.....thanks for reading",
    "Advice/Help Hi there! So I decided to create a new Reddit account to write this. Im not sure if this is the right subreddit  but thought Id want to just talk about things. I have been dealing with anxiety for around 3 years now, and have been experiencing depressive symptoms for around a month. I dont want it to sound like Im complaining  but I just feel exhausted. Im tired of always trying to be better, to improve and hoping that things will change. I had seen different psychologists over those 3 years, and although one had worked really well for me  the rest felt like I was just talking about my problems without actually coming up with a solution. Honestly, it feels a little bit surreal for me to even be writing a post  because Ive tended to lurk reddit for so long and just read things. I know people say that things will get better, and yes  there is COVIDlockdown. I just become so angry with myself that Im not improving at the rate that I really want to be. And I honestly dont even know where to start to initiate that improvement. I guess I just really want help.",
    "I'm a 14 almost 15 year old that lack confidences and have very low self esteem. Plus hate my appearance and it ruins my life. I just realized people try their best just to avoid talking to me especially at school. I often get ignored and pushed aside from my classmates during anything. Even the teachers and staff wont give me the light of day, when i need it most. Also comparing myself to others to the point where its an obsession. I cant stop! Some of my classmates amp friends have features that i desire curves, pretty faces, amp lighter skin colors. But sadly can never have without plastic surgery They are highly praised and make me feel ugly. Multiple people on multiple occasions have told me that Im ugly and dont want to be caught dead standing beside me. It makes me believe them even when i tried multiple times to disregard it. My self esteem and confidences just drowned within a couple of days. NEED HELP 14 almost 15",
    "What's so wrong with me that no one stays? Like, okay, I get it partly because I wouldnt want to be friends with me either probably? But also, I just want to know what I am doing wrong? I can be talking to people and have a great friendship with them and then they just totally... Disappear? Whenever Ive reached out, we might have a very distant conversation and then that conversation stops and we just dont talk again for ages unless I contact them. And even then, its just the same thing? So eventually I stop reaching out and they never send me anything. And this has happened multiple times with people I was very close with. What the fuck is so wrong with me that no one wants to stay? I want people to be close with or at least talk to but everytime I just end up getting hurt. Everything hurts tonight",
    "I'm so tired I ran out of therapy appointments, it didnt really help anyways and my therapist never really gave me any methods to feel better instead of just trying to do things more. I got swarmed with homework again, having to finish two full art projects and some other things I forgot, but my family was going on a trip over the weekend at this point I stopped fighting over quarantining it was clear they didnt listen to my concerns so I wouldnt be able to work on it much. Everything just built up to this point where something as relatively small as having to finish a project just made me snap. The night before the trip I just freaked out, I was a mess of tears and slamming stuff around my room while packing. I remember cutting my finger, I dont know why its just what I went too, I felt awful after it, it hurt a lot and while it calmed me down I just felt so embarassed and ashamed that I did it. That weekend everytime my finger brushed against something even slightly I just got reminded of what I did to myself, it was horrible. Sometime after or before, I have no idea really, something similar happened. I didnt do a couple of random spanish assignments in school and those appearently counted as quizes without us being told, causing my grade to drop to a solid 30 or 40. Again this was a pretty small problem that was cleared up shortly after but things built up so much that something like this was a breaking point. The night before a big spanish test that would either save or ruin my grade, I was completely overwhelmed again and just broke down, my mom was annoyed I was making noise that late and she kind of just aggressively told me to calm down a bunch but it only got worse. It just all felt so hopeless, but it was the first time in a while that I felt grounded in a way, that I ws actually there presently instead of just going through the motions, but the whole situation hurt. These downward spirals never really got better. Those were the worst examples but the time in between those was filled with me feeling a crushing sense of hopelessness and exhaustion constantly. I was tired of it all, I was overwhelmed to the point where small mishaps with homework could break me.",
    "The days have nothing to offer for me: Looking for projects or hobbies to ease depression Hey girls and guys, Im suffering from depression and social anxiety since I was 15 years old. Today Im 21. My symptoms are mainly anhedonia disinterest and joylessness, lack of drive, motivation and ability to get stimulated, painful negative thoughts starting right in the morning when I open my eyes about past, present, future, that I dont have anything to offer, that Im disabled, that future life has nothing to offer for me etc., lethargy, low mood, sadness, cognitive restrictions memory, focus, access to knowledge and thoughts and irrational social anxiety. I wake up and see nothing that waits on me, nothing that I wait for or am up to or interested in, no drive or motivation to stand up, nothing that drives me anhedonia again. I then think what reasons or motives do other normal people see when waking up? I feel so empty about what the day has for me. Only thing I can see is food, maybe. Even food is no drive for me, I dont eat that much and dont feel the need to eat, I suffer from lack of appetite due to depression. Sure, I dont have much self worth or confidence at all. I dont have many things Im passionate about or Im good in. I see the connection no things youre passionate drive or good at feelings of success giving self worth gt depression. I still do things. I have a side job, not quite good in it. I study psychology, 5th semestre already, not quite good in it. As already mentioned my cognition turned incredibly bad, I always think Im dumb and unable to follow conversations, intellectual topics and such. Studying and university tasks or contents are very hard for me. I play tennis but rarely, quite good in it. I used to go to the gym, was boring but still quite good for distraction and feelings of success. I produce digital music, quite good in it and makes fun when I have a good day. I would love to play tennis and visit the gym more often but 1. they all contain socializing as there are people, so my social anxiety makes it incredibly hard for me and 2. now there is Corona.",

    "Got rejected from my desired program Hi, I was bullied and betrayed by probably all the people I thought I loved and was also living with my abusive dad when I was attending my last year of high school. This caused me to be severely depressed and suicidal during that year, but miraculously I still managed to get in to my dream school which happened to be UBC Canadian school. Anyways I was accepted into the Sauder School of Business in UBC and went there right after high school. However, that was the WORST decision of my life because I was still severely depressed and suicidal by the time university came around and scored the lowest marks of my life. Im talking about me being a 95 GPA student in high school going straight to a 55 GPA student in university, and also failed a science course my favorite subject btw. This happened because the whole first term, I stayed in bed so much resulting in missing class, barely showered, ate irregularly, and refused to hand in assignments just because I subconsciously wanted to selfsabotage myself or something. This really screwed my grades up, but thankfully I started seeing a psychologist and also got antidepressants and they helped me function normally after my first term in my first year. Ever since then, Ive tried my best to correct my mistakes and raise my GPA, been scoring mostly As and Bs I managed to get my GPA up to 75 but that first term just... drags me down still. I recently applied to change programs to science because I realized business is just NOT for me, and I want to do science... but I got rejected due to my failed course and my past 55 GPA for the first 5 courses I ever took in university. Im already one year behind because of my decision to change programs but now Ill be 2 years behind because of this rejection  I have to reapply for the next year . Im broke and poor and have to pay more debt the longer I stay in school  I dont even know if Ill be accepted next year when I reapply... Anyone have any advice for me? Im so lost... I feel like even when I function normally, depressed me from the past will always drag me down and bring me back to that state...",

    "Can SSRIs worsen creativity/interest in arts/music? Hi, not sure where to post this. Ive been making music since I was 7, and I come from a traumatic background. In bad times, Ive often turned to music to help me deal with the negative feelings and it has been constructive most of the time. My mental health got worse through high school and college as a result of constantly repressing my trauma and trying to push through with sheer willpower and stubbornness. My life is a wreck as a result Ill spare the details, but I now have no college degree and havent held a reliable job in almost three years now. I kept up music through those hard times, and the last song I wrotereleased was in August of 2019. Around the same time, my psychiatrist diagnosed me with OCD and I switched from Prozac to Zoloft both SSRIs which Im currently on. The OCD has improved somewhat, but I cant bring myself to play my instruments since that month and I dont know why. Even when I listen to music on Spotify, which I used to do for hours per day by choiceenjoyment, it feels like I just hear noise now the patterns that I know I could recognize by ear before feel arbitrary and I lose interest before it can even form. Im doing introspection with my therapist and trying to get to the root of this problem, and Im sure there are environmental factorslife events that have contributed to this as well. Is this a common side effect for musiciansartists on antidepressants? Its hard to find anything written on the matter online.",
    "19 years old and its pretty obvious there's no reason to go any further To live without being under someone elses rule? Or is that gift only given to animals in nature who dont have to live by human code? Id literally rather be dead or anything else other than human. I just dont know what to do anymore I just live each day so sad and depressed, nothing excites me anymore and I have absolutely no motivation to even try anything anymore. I 100 dont blame drug addicts for their choices in life, smoking weed does help me feel better about myself and the position Im in but at the end of the day all it does is make me feel better about life in that exact moment and does nothing for me in the long run which from my point of view seems completely doomed of being meaningful anyways. Id love to have two children but if they had to go through what Im going through right now then all their pain and depression would be all my fault and this life just isnt something Id want to give to someone else its just not worth it. Im too much of a wimp to just shoot myself but at the same time itd just be so easy, I just hope that some accident happens to me thats quick and painless. Theres a gun safe in my brothers room and just about every day I just imagine how peaceful itd be after I kill myself to no longer be bound to this unforgiving world.

    "Life advice help? So New Years just passed and I just went on a former close friend on mines instagram page and I was just on social media in general and before I even finish this, please dont give me, everyday goes through life at a different pace I noticed that her and other people seem to have actual lives. She performs songs plays, etc , has a relationship etc. and me? No guy had ever looked my way, my life is literally wake up , school, come home, homework, rinse and repeat. I also have social anxiety so its hard for me to go out and even then still, I think Im grossly unattractive. Have never ever taken a good picture, last picture I took was for the school yearbook months ago. I simply just dont take pictures. I feel behind everyone and everything. I realize how at my age this decade is literally the decade on change for my generation, but I havent dont anything. Never been kissed, held hands, complimented, looked at. And it doesnt help that Im a dark skin girl and nowadays boys and men seem to go out of their way especially black men, to point out how they believe dark skin girls are unattractive in all ways. I just feel behind. I mean the girl I was talking about was the girl I did everything with in elementary and middle school till we moved for high school and she had the most basic things that I cant even get. I mean high schoolers get to yall about relationships, and me, Im here too ugly to even be given a second glance. 2020 is off to the worst possible start.i want to be someones first choice. I have friends but I know Im not their first choice, I feel like the leftover friend. I feel like if life is literally not happening for me, I shouldnt even be alive, whats the point. And I release that yes I need to go out there, but how do I do that when my head is constantly telling me all my flaws, from the shape of my nose to the darkness of my skin, to my introverted personality. I feel defeated, cause I dont want this life if its all Im getting, watching every body progress and experience while Im stuck and I feel I cant get out.",

I had surgery in April and should be back on the field in October. I try to exercise to the best of my ability, I try my best to eat as much as I can appetite has been very low recently.

    "Soon to be dad and I’m struggling to cope So Ive written posts about this before but heres the basics. My pregnant girlfriend split up with me. She said she dident love me anymore. I lost my temper and said some things I shouldnt have which I admit was my fault. We dident talk or have any contact for 6 weeks I drunk heavily during this time and my depression was unbearable. I eventually reached out and apologised and explained I wanted to be there for the baby. She agrees I meet her for the first time since we broke up and she makes it clear she never wants to get back together and just wants to be friends. So since then Ive cut right back on my drinking intact I dont drink anymore. As the son of a alcoholic looser father I dont want that for my child I want to be a good dad. Anyway every time I talk to her it feels like a kick in the teeth. So I actively avoid messaging her and only respond to her when she messages me cause of all the pain it brings up. The only thing keeping me going is the baby. But its been 10 weeks since we broke up and I still feel just as broken and miserable inside. I dont have any friends I sit on my PlayStation all day just trying to zone out and focus on something other than how miserable I am. I thought that when I stopped drinking I would feel better and to be honest I dont I still feel like shit. I have a therapist whos helpful and a support worker to help me not go back to drinking. But it doesnt help much and to be honest I just dont know what to do anymore.",
    "I’m 15 and don’t want to live with my dad anymore. My parents have been divorced for 7 years and I go to my moms house weekdays, my dads weekends. The main issue I have with my dad is that I simply cant trust him. I cant open up to him without him rejecting my opinion. Growing up with him has made me feel helpless, and living with him feels like giving him all the control. He has threatened to take my phone because I said I value emotional relationships more than comfortable living. He threatened to go to court and call the police if I refused to go to his house. I said I wouldnt mind going for dinner and such, but he outright rejects my opinions. He said it wasnt my choice, and that just proves my point where I cant trust him to respect my feelings. He knows I have depression. He says hes willing to change, but I dont have the mental capacity to live with him if he doesnt change by himself. I live in BC Canada, so the age requirement for choosing who to live with is 19, but I researched about it and it said that the court will mostly decide for the childs best interest. Im terrified of the slightest possibility that my dad will win custody. At that point, I might as well kill myself. My dad is a negative influence, a toxic personality. I cut out most toxicity from my life because its caused me to be depressed, and its why I dont want to see him again. Im trying to compromise but I cant live with him. I just feel upset and terrified right now.",

    "Post-divorce depression Hi Im 38 and male. I had a divorce 6 months ago. The divorce was not my choice , but relatively friendly , I dont see the point of staying with someone who doesnt want to be with you. But in a way that made it even worse .. because it just feels like she gave up on our relationship. Since then Ive gotten more and more depressed. Im originally from Costa Rica , but studied and worked in the US where I was very successful . When I was 32 I decided to move back because I wanted to start a family in a place with more permanence and better worklife balance. In order to do that I took a very big paycut and work at a job that isnt really that challenging for me. Everything made sense when I was getting married , but now Im divorced, we didnt have kids  a big part of the breakup despite no medical reason for it , and both of us trying  , and I feel like a professional failure when I compare myself to my friends and family who continued their career path. Im turning 40 in a year and a half and I just feel like I wasted all my 30s. Im having a really hard time planning for the future , I just dont have any goals anymore and feel like I cant get excited for anything . If I think about things objectively I know I have options . I can try to change jobs maybe get a second masters and get a two year work visa to the US or Europe to get back into the workforce . But I have no energy or motivation , maybe Im just afraid of trying and failing again. Part of me just wants to give  up. Dont know what to do , I feel stuck .",

Ive done nothing of note, not even watching a movie or going to the grocery store, the only times Ive left my house are for sports practice which I dread and just despise. I think its been a long time coming but in the past few hours Ive felt myself slipping in again to the pot of despair where Im more irritated, testy, emotional and numb, and moody, and overall a pit in my stomach forms that I have to live through.

    "My ex husband dead because of me and I hate living I married my ex husband when I was 18. We had 2 kids together. I already had 2. There was ups and downs. Good times and bad ones but something that stayed constant was he wouldnt work. I went to nursing school with the promise he would take care of the home. This didnt happen. After 7 years of this and also quite a bit of mental abuse I divorced him. The kids started getting into trouble and were so upset. Plus to be honest I missed him. I went back. I did this for 8 more years. Meanwhile he had developed quite the tab habit. And me overdrawn everyday day trying to feed habits and kids. I didnt leave again til it got so bad he was needing stronger and stronger things and me and the 2 girls left at home had no running water or lights. It was hard without family. He begged and begged me to come back. Just like last time. He also played bad guy and even tried to get me fired. He died less then a year after we left. He was in a crack house. High on heroin and fentanol. His kids devastated. So now here am i.. with all the things ppl know I went through. And I have to be strong for the kids. But there was some good times too. Some only him and I shared. He understood me like no one else. He wasnt always a drug addict. Maybe I actually hoped subconsciously that he would get better and we could try again. After all I had never cared about anyone like I do him. All I know is I miss him so fucking much! I cry every day. I dont wanna live without him. Everything and I mean everything makes me think of him.. and Im so lost. I cant believe he left me. He left me here without him and it hurts so damn bad and I dont know how to make it stop. I just want him.... and all this im feeling roaring in me like a fire.",

And i decided I will. There is no point, Im not happy and im always alone. This is my goodbye. I am posting this in the hopes that maybe someone will care. In the hopes that maybe someone will try to stop me, but I dont think thats what will happen. No body seems to really care about me these days. Im just another guy on the street to everyone. This will probably get buried but oh well.. I have posted this on another subreddit. So if you see this twice that is why.",
    "I don’t know what to do I 19 have been severely depressed for about 6 years undiagnosed. At around the same time my depression started, I was pulled out of public school by my mom so she could homeschool me. Her idea of homeschooling is to not teach me and instead expects me to be motivated enough to work completely on my own with no deadlines. I dont have any motivation to live, let alone finish my schooling. I am almost 20 and have not graduated high school. I only need to CLEP out of three more classes to graduate but the task feels so overwhelmingly impossible and I know Im running out of time. I feel like I have already ruined my life so why finish? Depression has fucked up my brain so bad I fear it is damaged beyond repair. Im not living anymore. The only thing I do now is scroll through social media all day and think about possibly doing my schoolwork. And to think I was once the smart kid. The one advantage I have is that I started taking college classes when I was 14 and have nearly enough credits for an associates degree. I might be able to transfer to a 4year school but I dont know who will be willing to accept me since i never took the ACT or SAT. Even if I did get in to a good university, what the hell would I major in? I had a few interests in mind but depression has taken them away and subjects that I once found intriguing no longer bring me joy. I have no idea where to start. I just really, really need advice and a reason to keep going. Thanks for listening.",
    "I don’t know what to do anymore My mum just saw my fresh cuts for the first time, freaked out, yelled at me for over an hour while sobbing. Then went out to get my brother from practice and barely trusted me home alone. Im terrified of her telling my dad as I dont wanna disappoint him, and I feel like a shit daughter for making her cry. Ive had numerous anxiety attacks and I dont know how to cope with it all and where to go from here. What if she hates me now or treats me like Im crazy. Im so overwhelmed and I just want a hug",

Its extremely weird and I dont know what to do to resolve this problem. Thx for any help.",
    "I ( 26 female ) have decided to take care of my severely depressed younger brother (20m ) by letting him move in with me last week and need some tips. Moreover, I dont want his depression to trigger me and I dont want his negativity  not shaming him he is just very depressed and sick and needs help but his depression makes him so negative about everything  to bring me down, I want to keep pushing for a better life for myself and my brother without the negativty bringing me down as I worked so hard to get to a somewhat surface level healthy mindset  I say this because I.myself can get easily triggered and spiral if things feel to overwhelming especially when it comes to my family  ... It worries me because everything he says is a cognitive distortion and in life, as we know, you become the people you hang out with the most.. 4 . I want him.to become more resilient, I am not expecting a cure but I want him to be processing in the right direction not the other way around. 5. I also respect that he has a serious disease that needs medical attention and specialized  tailored followups. I want to be a good example to him... one that is different from my parents.. He has become like them . Negative about everything on top of having severe psychomotor retardation and lack of appetite  hence why I am am getting him to the doctor tomorrow . 6. He has been on antidepressants before but it wasnt good. He had more appetite but still didnt leave his room. Meds are not unknown to him. I believe tomorrow the doctors help will give us the best choices for him. 7. He is aware he is sick and even agrees he needs meds, we.watched a 50 min video by Dr. Sapolsky yesterday regarding how depression affects the brain and he realized just how affective depression is to the hypocampus etc... My brother knows he has congirive distortions most of the time. How do I keep him motivated to stay on track and improve slowly slowly day by day ?",
    "I’m crying at work; should I ask to clock out? Content warning self harm and depressive feelings. Im not diagnosed with depression or anxiety, but I feel it often. I have intrusive thoughts and I just dont want to do anything. Im at work right now and I cant focus on work and just keep crying. I cut myself last night for the first time in 8 years and I feel horrible. I want to crawl into my bed and just let my job go to shit and just get fired but I need this job. Its a good job and I like it. I just cant handle today. What do u do?",
    "Being judged When you find out that a guy is a virgininexperienced in dating do you think less of him? Like he is less of a man or somehow immaturechildish. I often feel like when it comes up in conversation girls seem to take me less serious after for whatever reason. It is almost always met with shock, them thinking in silence for a minute, then asking why. Like they are expecting a one word response like religion, which isnt the case. Im just trying to figure out whats going through peoples heads when I say this. It usually just kills the conversation or brings it to a topic I dont really want to discuss. It even catches some guys off guard a lot of times and they seem to usually behave around me differently so its not even just girls acting this way. Also I only bring this up when asked, I dont go around broacasting this. Am I just going about telling people the wrong way or is it a major red flag that I have to live with?",
    "I'm so tired I wanted it to stop, I just wanted this awful string of events to end already, yet whenever I got scared or overwhelmed all I was told was to get through it to summer, but I couldnt. I didnt think I could do it, at this point I was being told it would get better soon for months on end but everything got worse. They said thats just life, theres always something to get in your way but you have to do it regardless, but I couldnt cope with that anymore, I couldnt cope with that awful reality. I just didnt enjoy living anymore, and if its this bad now as only a highschooler I couldnt imagine myself being older, in an actual work environment where the same problems persisted. I wanted it to end so badly, nothing was improving and the foreseeable future looked awful and stressful. I promised myself that if it got this bad again Id ask to see a therapist again, it took a couple weeks. Sometime towards the end of next week I learned that I was also taking the SAT another standardized test infamous for not working in the southeast in about ten days, leaving me with not nearly as much time to prepare as I thought. I broke down completely, preparing for the AP exam took enough out of me alone, but two of them back to back was a death sentence for me. I kept crying over the idea that it got worse again, that whenever I thought I was at rock bottom it just kept going downhill, no mtter what I did I would continue to feel awful about living itself. I laid out a ten day study plan to go through, saying that in ten days it would be over and the better times everyone talked about would finally be here, it hurts to say but I dont think thats happening. I remember the next day where during all of class I lied in bed, not saying a word to the friends I usually talk to all day, it just all felt so hopeless.",
    "I'm 16 and I'm a mess sorry in advance for bad grammar I dont remember when it started. It was weird, realizing how much I stopped enjoying most things. My favorite video games werent as exciting anymore. I wasnt as interested in anime and Manga anymore, I didnt feel like consuming it either. My days became boring, each one beginning with the envy of enjoying something that I used to love and each of them ending with this overwhelming feeling of regret. I was more angry, I ranted with myself a lot about stupid things, I was crying more, most of the time because of stupid things albeit that started a chain of thoughts leading to more serious issues and regrets. And mostly, I was so tired man, and it just gets worse and worse. Its to a point where it feels crippling, like I cant do anything anymore that requires a minimum of effort. I dont understand. Lots of times, I wasnt even sure if I really had something. Maybe Im just too lazy? Maybe Im just tired? Is it really depression? But why? Why would I have these thoughts, when others are having a it so much worse than me? I dont understand. I feel so overwhelmed by myself. Sometimes I want to confess to someone, to tell them everything I have on my mind, but now I just feel like there is so much that I dont even know where to begin. Nowadays, I cant even make the effort of talking to my friends. Im scared that Ill lose them. Im scared Im not being a good enough friend, Im scared Im isolating from them and they will just go, Im scared that Im not enjoy their presence enough and I know I will regret just lie everything else. I know I can make them laugh and smile but I feel like I cant even do that properly anymore, like Im slowly losing this ability, I feel like Im not as interesting as I used to be, or as I could be, I feel like Im not as funny, and I feel so much more things that I cant even begin to list. I feel like Im a shadow of an older self, like my real me died and I am just his shed, slowly crumbling to pieces.",
    "Depression has gotten pretty bad. Hi, so in these last months my world has been flipped upside down with the COVID19 messing with everything. Due to this I have had to move home into my verbally abusive household and finish my college program online. On top of this I am working a cashier job I hate, and I am left alone with my thoughts everyday I come home from work. My friends havent contacted me in a few months and Im always the one reaching out to them, and my partner is very distant. I havent felt this alone in a while. All in all everything keeps going wrong, one thing after the other. And I am tired of it. My suicidal thoughts have become evermore present this past month, and Im requesting support because I just dont know how to feel okay anymore. I dont expect to be happy all the time, but I cant even remember the last time I felt happy. I just dont know what to do anymore. Thank you for reading.",

I dont have anybody I can talk to....no friends, no trustables or anything. My parents dont believe the existence of mental health in children so If I tell them that I am experiencing extreme mood swings and depression I get the answer dont be sad or if you will be sad it will become a habit. I need to get back to normal quickly because I am having an important exam. And my parents have indirectly told me that they are going to judge me. I am always feeling hopeless and anxious and worried and depressed. I feel like crying the entire day but I dont because it doesnt changes anything.",
    "Should I kill myself? I am the most uninteresting person and I feel like I am the only one who puts effort into any of my relationships. I actually am in a relationship though, we started dating in april. Its a ldr though, and her timezone is 14 hours ahead. It was pure infatuation at the start, we both felt so confident about the relationship. She had plans to move to the same city as me, we had so much in common. We were both sort of shy and laid back. Though as I got more comfortable my extroverted side came out. I think I smoothered her too much though, I always complimented her and tried to tell her itll be okay and I am eilling to wait for borders to lift to meet her. She liked it so I kept doing it, but I think the repetitiveness, lack of physical touch, and my neediness eventually became unattractive. It became the norm. I was always there for her when she needed to talk, and we kept talking about how we are going to meet as soon as borders go up. It was hard to keep interesting and we didnt know what else to do. Then in the last month, things started getting hard for me at work and in my family, I opened up about insecurities about my mom health as she was diagnosed with cancer, and how I feel I have to work on my confidence. I think this must have really been a turn off. She has become more and more distant this past month. She still says shes into me but she doesnt talk about the future as much and is not nearly as affectionate as before. She has said she doesnt know how much longer she can do ldr, but shes willing to keep trying a little longer for me. But it feels like she isnt putting any effort and idk, the relationship doesnt feel secure and loving anymore. I talked to her about it and she said she really likes me, but she feels so distant. Idk what I can do to help this or if theres anything. I really like her, like we never fought, and we really matched. I loved gsming with her, or playing piano for her.",

    "Advice to an 18 y/o depressed closeted bisexual dude who mostly has anti-lgbt religious family &amp; friends and is contemplating suicide? Theres this one friend, lets call him Matthew, who used to be my youth group leader and is also a fan of RuPauls Drag Race and Queer Eye. We both went to the same school same grade but different strands in Senior High. However, Im not so sure if hed react positively if I openly accept my bisexuality since the church he serves in has made antilgbt preachings. When we graduated Senior High School on April last month, I messaged him amp promised wed catch up with each other about life since we havent talkedseen each other at church for a long time, but we still havent done it and still havent talked to each other ever since. Maybe I might come out as bi to a few close friends soon, or maybe not. Ive noticed my teacher from 11th grade seems to be an ally and I even consider him a great close friend, so hes definitely one of the first people Ill come out to IF I decide to do it. I think to myself that some things are better left unsaid, but these unsaid words are killing me, and theyve been building up in my head for a long time. Its hard to be yourself when youre not what most people wantexpect you to be. Ive been thinking about leaving this Earth, maybe write individual notes to each of my friendsfamily before I go. The only reasons why I still havent pursued this is because I dont want to hurt my family amp friends, and Im afraid of dying without fulfillment for now, at least. And even if I come out to a few friends, what if the word comes out and it got spread to some people until it might reach my familyfriends and they avoid me? Its just hard to wrap my head around. Theres always those things amp thoughts bringing me down. I consider myself an agnostic now. I just want to be accepted but I fear the peoplefamilyfriends around me wont take it well.

    "Slipping back into a depressive episode, but this time the stress in not very manageable Basically, to sum it up gtmoved from overseas back to the states. Month or so later move to CA with family member, because they said I could have a really good opportunity. Their job fell through, we move back to home state. Ended up moving Moved to a new place with a family member in a different city months later. Covid starts. No job. Family member says I have a few years with them and its okay. Fast forward to this year  they get into a relationship and now want to move in with them  kick me out. I have no car because their extra car went to my other family member who already had two cars for I dont know why. They told me I could share their car its no problem, assuming in a year or so Id be good enough to move out. But now I have 6 months, little work, no car, and I have to be ready to go somewhere. Ive done about 20 or 25 applications and only three got back to me saying no. I feel like the whole reason I was able to stay with my family member was out of obligation and they were lonely. Now since they arent lonely, its now my fault for not working during Covid and being ambitionless  despite pouring time into now whats a contracted job of audio engineering audio is my passion. So now I have less than a year and at the moment months before Im homeless. Im not on my meds anymore, I was on viibryd for a while. Now Im starting to feel like there is an easy way out of this. I feel like my situation isnt my fault, but to my family member they think I deserve this. One thing that annoys me is that we would make a deal in which I can do x and y for my family member and I would get paid weekly for it during Covid . But that always ended up falling through because they quit. Also the fact that the premise of their thoughts was that they are lonely , wont find anyone, so no rush.

    "I'm about to confess to my family how bad my depression really is but i dont know how. I, 27M somewhat purposely fcked my life up. Sorry for my bad English, not a native speaker. I did everything i could to rack up as much debt as possible. Started ignoring all my friends and parts of my family whom i used to be really close with. I stopped taking care of my rented apartment and myself. So basically Im living in a web of lies. All of this was basically to make it easier to kll myself. But i now realized i cant do it because it would destroy my mother, brother and sisters.. i know they love me and would do anything for me to make me feel better. But its easier to lie and say everything is fine and avoid talking about feelings. So now Im stuck... And i have to confess and try to get help but its really hard for me to talk about this because im ashamed and disgusted about myself and i dont know how or where to begin.

    "Is it all even worth it? Just to start it off, I DO NOT WANT TO KILL MYSELF. But recently Ive just been overwhelmed and I dont have anyone with whom I could share this. So basically before the winter breakweek ago everything was going great. I went on a friendly date with my crush that went well, my engineering contest was going great my biggest dream is to get into MIT and I am capable and school was fine. Fast forward to a few days ago when it all started going to shit. My crush left for a ski trip and gone cold, dont know if I did something wrong I have Aspergers and Im a typical stereotypical nerd, aka no dating skills, basically I dont pick up on the subtle hints at all or is it just the trip, I cant stop thinking about it and her, its very hard for me to find girls that I would call compatible, basically someone with a deep passion for something that basically defines them. That makes me distracted from my work which stresses me out even more. The contest Im taking part in is also kinda collapsing and Im very worried that Ill loose thousands of hours of CAD work and 500 in my currency 1500 that I invested into the project that I was promised back. Another team posted pictures that made me really anxious because of their complexity compared to the other teams and given their perfect score they might win. And the school part, my homeroom teacher that basically told me that he doesnt give a shit about me or my goals and that my reasons for joining this contest are wrong and that its all my fault that its gone to shit and that Im a tyrant who takes away all the work from my teammates which is totally false because they havent done a thing and basically dont care, anything I proposed I was told to do myself and most of the tasks of the other teammates also partially fell on me, like Hey can you help him with that? It got so bad that I had to get outside help which made my teacher even more mad so he started insulting me straight to my face, as well as behind my back, saying he doesnt want anything to do with me and basically disrespect my entire work and from my schoolmates tell me he is quite proud of it, it got to the point where my parent had to go and talk with the school.",

    "Therapist Reached Out I see a trauma therapist for PTSDCPTSD, and recently I encountered two other traumas which have put me over the edge at times. They know that I havent been doing the greatest while trying to deal with them and that Im continuing to spiral downwards. I usually send a weekly message to my therapist to let them in on the skills Im using and how my week has been. I havent been up for sending messages lately, and I probably scared the crap out of my T last session as I discussed how much I hated having the intense suicidal ideation and how detailed its becoming. I even blew up in their face telling them that they didnt understand how serious I was. I could even hear her start to choke up as rarely do I talk to her in this manner. Today, she sent out a message to let me know how she could help me throughout the week. Im very confused as I have no idea how a therapist can help anyone through the week. I truly appreciate the message of concern, but how can I ask my T for help during the week without it crossing boundaries? I know for sure shes not going to bring me food or allow me to call her, so what does help look like as I know I could use some?",

    "Alone in a new country. Feeling terrible. I wanted to make friends and get advice from people in the same situation as me. But now it feels like everyone is just a huge jerk, and Im the worst person in the world for daring to move to their country. Theyre expats too! Its making me feel so terrible. I havent been able to get out of bed for days. I wake up in the night sobbing. Ive stopped eating. I feel like Im not wanted in this country. Im feeling so stupid for thinking that moving here was a good idea. I feel stupid for being upset about it too. They were calling me a snowflake for just calmly asking about how to do a simple thing I didnt know how to do. So me being upset just proves them right. Everything they said about me is just the truth. I say it to myself everyday anyways. I feel bad telling my boyfriend how I feel because he works really hard all day, and comes home late and really tired. I dont want to bother him by complaining about my problems. Ive already talked a lot with him about it all, and hes really good at trying to make me feel better and listening to me. But I just feel so guilty, so I keep a lot of it in.

I moved to a different country to pursue my career when I was 18 now Im 20 and I feel like the last 3 years of my life are a blur is like my head stopped making memories the second I left home.

    "Does anyone else totally disassociate when they're drunk? Okay, so I know that alcohol is a depressant and that it usually doesnt mix well when youre already depressed, but I wouldnt think a response to it would ever be consistently this bad. Long story short, went out for a few drinks with some work friends to celebrate my last day and the new job that I got. It was fun, these are people I like, and things were starting to get a bit better for me. Took 173 applications but I finally got a salaried gig, finally established a group of friends for myself after moving to a new city in a pandemic, found an advisor for my masters thesis. But at a certain point, maybe one or two beers past where I should have stopped, I just wasnt there. I left, didnt say goodbye to anyone, attempted to bike home, and cried on the side of the road after falling off my bike. Im usually a little bit of an emotional drunk, but I mostly just get affectionate and want to make sure my friends know that I love them. Its never been this, Ive never felt this outside of my own experience. Thoughts?",
    "i want it all to end Last year i got done with my senior highschool year and despite working soo hard for since june till the next june, studying hours daily i ended up falling short of the percentage i needed to enter the major i wanted to which is computer science and let myself and my family down. I had to major in finances since it was my only choice and i am hating it. Moreover i am hating the fact that i am living with myself as a failure, i never achieve anygoals that i want and i never get anywhere. I have OCD which i am taking medication and therapy for and it has been kicking in so hard lately with all the negativity making me go crazy. I am always depressed and my family is disappointed from me. I just feel like a burden now on every body around me i always have breakdowns and my family always blasts me for it. All my relatives are engineers and other good majors and jobs and i am stuck in this. i am sorry if my writing isnt organized but i am so disoriented right now. I feel like if i just die i would relief every body around me from my burden and relief them from the shame of having me. I cant stand living with my self knowing that i an a complete and utter failure. I dont deserve anything. I will never get anywhere in life i just want it all to end. i just want to die i cant live with myself anymore. And it is a relief knowing that when i die no one will care as i dont want to hurt anyone. I have no friends, my family wish they didnt have me. My relatives didnt even care to call or visit me when i was hospitalized after a cycling accident. I just wish to die and be forgotten instead of living in misery and burdening my family. I dont want to kill my self because i am a bit religious and suicide is prohibited in my religion but i wish i could. I just want to die i cant live anymore. I hate my self. I hate seeing my self in the mirror every morning. I hatr waking up and knowing i am still alive. i cry my self to sleep every might wishing i never wakeup again but i still do.",

Im lucky I found him because I have no doubt that I wouldnt be here today without him, but Im scared that Im making him worse, that I cant help him get up and do things because I myself cant motivate myself to do the same thing. I always feel like a burden, even though he insists that he doesnt think of me that way. I just want to make him happy. I want him to have a good life.

    "I can’t help myself, and there is nowhere to get help. I dont know if I can say that I tried to fix whats wrong with me. I attempted to get better and fix myself, and every time I tried I failed. I tried understanding why I failed, and I failed at that too. I also have gender dysphoria. It isnt bad most of the time, I dont know if I should try to do something about it, but it hurts me. I came out to my mum and she acted like I killed her son, so I got back into the closet. So I have no idea what to do. I have a friend, but she is not really in a great place to help me, and since my friend is not my therapist, she cant help me in a way a therapist might be able to help me. I tried just ignoring my dysphoria and I guess it works to some extent but its not really insignificant. But its also not significant enough for me to make up my mind about fixing it. Also my parents are not mentally very stable so if I came out it could financially hurt my sister. Because my dad is the only provider and his mental state is hanging by a thread. I tried thinking hard about stuff, and I failed. I tried doing stuff but I failed. Lets say that I failed to try hard enough maybe. I cant help myself. I have no hope from the future, everything is going to get worse. I am also sick, some kind of bone marrow disease. One day it may kill me. Doctors arent really sure if I have it but they basically treat me like I have it, so it is likely that I have it. And I have started to notice that I dont really want to get better. I dont know what a normal day feels like anymore. I dread the future. I also noticed that I have an obsession with pain.",
    "Being suicidal and scared to die So for as long as I can remember I have been depressed, I dont mean that in the oh yeah Ive been sad for a while I mean I was first formally diagnosed with clinical depression at age 6 in 1997. I like to joke that its my longest lasting relationship. So what brings me to write this post? Ive been in a horrendous depressive episode for the last 18 months over my live Ive been depressed all but 6 years, but it comes and goes in waves steadily its been getting worse and worse, becoming suicidal, secluding myself, and all the other lovely things that go with it. I want to die, I dont want to be here anymore, and before you suggest medication, Ive been on every medication for depression also multiple for anxiety and a couple antipsychotic meds too. Counselling has never worked for me, I stopped doing illicit drugs years ago stopped smoking, stopped drinking, tried exercise and diets. Yet, I still have suicidal thoughts and feelings everyday, all day, and night. I wake up sad that I have woken up. I go to sleep hoping that I have stroke or heart attack that kills me in my sleep. Ive planned my suicide so many times and in so many different ways, I have attempted suicide a few times in the past. Now to the crux of my problem, I want to die, but Im scared of actually being dead. Any thoughts or suggestions will be welcome. Thanks.",

By the time I turned 18, It went really down low. I even hit the lowest point in Early 2019. I been diagnosed with Clinical Depression and still currently go to see a therapist. I been having those ugly thoughts especially after I hit the lowest point after my Dads Death. Now, I felt like my lifes been over 2 Years Ago. I been wishing that I would disappear from this world, leaving behind a memory of my past. I have been feeling a little better after seeing a therapist after months of stop going. Its been like 2 months. Anyways, Im starting to gain a little hope. Yet, I am concern about how long it will last. My fear that a bit of hope would be short lived. I cant risk going back to my old ways. I want to feel young again. I want to feel like I am truly happy again. I want to go back the way it was before my dads death.

    "how to explain my mental health situation to my professors Ive recently been going through a really tough window of depression. I can barely do any of my schoolwork no matter how hard I try. I am slipping off the ball. Ive forgotten several assignments and Im going to have to submit them late when I finish them. A few of my professors have even emailed me to ask where my work is I go to a small university with small class sizes. I also feel awful because it isnt like Ive submitted everything on time before this. Ive submitted things late before, earlier on this semester. And at those times I always simply apologized for being late but I never offered any real explanations. I dont think I can do that anymore though, since Im now a repeat offender and my profs probably all think Im extremely lazy and disorganized they wouldnt be entirely wrong. I feel like I owe them an explanation and I really want to be forgiven for this. But I dont know what I can say. The truth is that I know exactly how much work I have to do and I know that I should be doing it, but I just cant make myself to 95 of it. I just feel pathetic. What can I say to them to explain this? I dont know how to be vulnerable and risk getting no understanding by telling them the truth. I mean how unprofessional is it to say Im sorry I didnt submit the assignment. I spent the last week in bed trying not to die. But I also dont want to make up some BS excuses either...

My depression is bad, my anxiety is going crazy, basically, my fight or flight mode is going awol. I will be fine in my room watching YouTube or reading my book and Ill have this hot, panicking feeling in my stomach and its always in the evening. Not to brag, I also cant sleep anymore because of that feeling. I push my friends away. I deleted Facebook and Snapchat so they couldnt contact me, I didnt go to my graduation and I know when I talk about this stuff to my friends I know Im pissing them off when I keep telling them the same things Im going through and that every few weeks I tell them to forget me. They say its fine and they care but I can tell that they find it uncomfortable. I saw them for some graduation drinks after they convinced me to meet them. I really tried to be okay, telling myself it will all be fine, but it wasnt. I got there and when I saw them I felt angry, jealous, bitter and out of place they were discussing their new jobs, girlfriends, graduation, they were happy and I was sat there just drinking and was furious that they were happy and okay and Im sad and alone what sort of person does that. Its a weird complex where I love them and want to see them but when I do Im really sad and want to be alone forever and when Im alone I want to see them, and the cycle continues.

I think i have been depressed for a long long time but I have always felt embarrassed to speak about it I have never mentioned it to friends family or my boyfriend but today I finally realised this feeling has not gone away for what feels like years. I was beginning to think this was just my personality now but I know deep down I wasnt always this way I was happy before but I dont really know what went wrong. I just really need to speak to someone who understands but I feel as though if I ever mention it out loud then people will just think Im looking for attention or that I am over reacting.

I know there are people out there who are so much worse with depression than I but I cant handle this anymore I just want to be happy again. Everyday I get angry with people who dont deserve it and I dont even know what ever made me angry. I push people away who just wanted to be my friend. I always have a problem with everything and I am sick of it. Its not fair on others around me to have to walk on eggshells around me. I need to get a grip and fix this and stop being selfish because I am too embarrassed to admit that my mental health has been getting worse over the last few years.. I have spent the last few days researching and doing online tests and I think its time to admit it.

    "The current situation has caused a HUGE setback Thank the good Lord for food stamps and Food Share, Ill never go hungry. So since Im disabled, waiting for benefits, my rent is 50month. I also had internet shut off because I couldnt pay them just 50 too. My needs are small Ive had help from friends and family, and then eventually from several local church charities. And, well, Ive run out of options and was scrolling through Reddit. I saw a couple of subs in which to ask for help. So I took a deep breath and posted how I need help paying my bills. The only reason I did this is that I have seen many messages of gratitude from individuals who received help. But that didnt happen for me. In fact there were some negative responses, and both posts where completely down voted. So, I guess either I dont know how to ask for help, or people just dont care. Lets add to my situation that my one good friend is going through some of their own challenges, and being a complete jerk. Ive heard that the economic stimulus package wont pay anyone who is not working. Figures, the people who need it the most get nothing. And I pray it is only a rumour, because 1000 could set me up for many months while I work on my disability claim. The California Governor has issued a shelter in place order. I have asthma pretty badly, so Im party of the group that SERIOUSLY shouldnt go out. Same with my motherinlaw. My anxiety and depression had returned in full force. I have thought, again of giving up on my life. There is really NOTHING good about it. At all. My sister has shunned me because she knows nothing about mental health, and thinks I should just be happy. Ive never really had any meaningful relationship with my mom. She has been emotionally unavailable my entire life. So what am I left with? A complete shut down. No news, or Internet. Im typing on my government phone which has very limited data. But at least I can post My friend is unavailable. Yesterday I went to my motherinlaws place so I could download some movies.",

    "Hey. I felt so betrayed that the people I loved and trusted the most in the world would do that so I became bitter and made a promise to myself that Id never share my life with them again. I acted out, maybe in an attempt to punish them, to get back at them for not caring. I just let myself go, let my life collapse little by little. Years have passed now and I honestly think Ive never been able to really give up hope that my family would be there for me, as if they would just suddenly drop whatever theyre doing and come to my side, telling me that they care and that well make this right. Now, as much it pains me to acknowledge it, I dont think thats ever going to happen. I just attempted to talk to my mother for the first time in months about my depression and she immediately got up and left the room. I feel like I should be undamaged by this by now, and I want to tell myself Im fine after that, but I feel so alone in this world and stupid for thinking that shed care enough to want to listen. This is all the more crushing because were on a family trip which I did not want to come to initially, but after we got here, I felt things that I hadnt felt for a long time, that I thought Id never feel again. Something made me want to get my life together and do things. So in the process of thinking about what Id like to do after this trip, the events I mentioned happened. I honestly feel very hopeless and my will to live has dwindled close to none. Should I just give up on my seemingly unrealistic dreams and expectations of a loving caring family and move on? It hurts my heart. so much. but seems like the only way to do anything with my life. Do I move on? for what? Myself? It just doesnt seem a good enough reason. I am not a good enough reason for me to continue living life. I dont care about myself enough. A life without love seems bleak, ugly and meaningless.

    "Please help, my girlfriend is depressed, I have no idea what to do. M, Both 14 years old. Ive felt Depression. I remember there was a time where I hated going to sleep because when I was left alone in the dark with my thoughts, all I ever heard them say is how fucking horrible life is and how much I wanted to kk myself, and I would fall asleep every night knowing I would wake up the next day with no motivation or reason to get out of bed. Every day was dull and empty, every second was a living hell. I had no appetite, lost alot of weight, lost the will to live, god I hated everything. Eventually things got better, but to be honest its kinda been happening again. Lifes been pretty good for me, materialistically, I have good friends, my relationships with family are good, I have an amazing girlfriend, its not as bad as it used to be, but I still feel like empty shit at times. But this isnt about me. My girlfriend lives a really hard life, which pains me so much because shes an amazing person and only deserves the best. Tonight was going well, we were in a call, we talked, did some homework, talked more, and then she left the call. Over text she said she wasnt ok and if it was a good time to talk about it, I said of course she can always talk to me.

    "How can I (28f) help my Mum (56f) who is depressed and considering suicide. Grandmas health has been worsening and Grandma is resisting the idea of going into a care home. Although Mum isnt dealing with Grandmas care anymore she is still stressed about it. She believes she is getting bullied at work claims to be getting coldshouldered and that people are hiding her belongings. She has worked there for about 10 years without incident before now and I have not seen any other evidence for this aside from her word which I do not consider trustworthy in her current state. I have tried to help her by Convincing her to begin antidepressants again which she is refusing to do, she will get fat again. To at least see a therapist she is refusing to as it doesnt work, also the only counselor in town is one of her cousins who she has been fighting with see above, I asked if she would consider travelling to see someone in another town or even zoom sessions with someone but she still steadfastly refused. I did ensure that she has helpline numbers easily accessible saved in her mobile, on the fridge and beside all the landlines in the house. Encouraging her to reach out to her friends and have a coffee or meal together she refuses to ask because she believes they will reject her invite, a why bother mentality. She also refuses to go out when they do invite her to things because she doesnt feel like it. Actively making plans with her which she has always bailed on despite apparent excitement beforehand. I have been in contact with several of her close friends and explained my concerns which they have shared and asked if they can make special effort to explicitly include her when getting together which I know they have as we have been in ongoing contact but she still has not been engaging. Taking all her calls and trying to gently help her see that some of her present mindsets are distorted when she calls I want her to recognise that she needs help so hopefully she will be open to trying something. Offering to pay dues for any clubs or organisations she would like to try as she claims she can not afford them. Offering suggestions of free community events she can attend. I also offered to attend with her if she would like she took this offer as an insult that she needed supervision.",
    "I need help *TW, self harm thoughts* Things have been stressful at home. My husband lost his job in the summer and neither one of us has been able to find a job. We were denied for government assistance, but my husband gets payment from the VA and unemployment. Because of this stress, my husband and I fight all the time. We love each other, its just so hard. I feel like if I told him about all this it would just add to his stress. Ive thought about putting myself on a psychiatric hold but I havent. I just dont know what to do anymore. I have nobody to talk to. I have a suicide diary in my phone. Ive attempted before when I was 16, so almost 10 years ago. I dont want to commit suicide, I just want something bad to happen to just me and I die. I know this is wrong and not a good sign, I know I need to see a therapist and get on more medicine but we have no insurance. I cant help but feel obnoxious, like a burden, unwanted, unloved, like Im just being used, like Im a terrible wife and mother. I even wrote in my suicide note that if Im ever found dead, to cremate me and throw me in the trash. I dont want to die necessarily because of my boys and my husband, I love them more than anything. I just cant help these thoughts and I feel terrible about it. And my husband has no idea, and neither do my boys. I just want to feel like Im enough, I guess. I dont even know if this makes sense.

Now, hes leaving less within a week and they ask me if I want to do a three way with them. They said that they were planning this for a while. But I refuse to, because I felt betrayed.

    "Why can't my friends and family see that I'm not fine? So this is hard for me, I really dont know where to start. Ive never felt fine, in my 31 years I cant remember actually feeling happy. Sure I smile and pretend Im ok to everyone I know. I get myself to work each day too, but only because its a routine. Pretty much twelve months ago something happened that triggered me to be bad enough that I couldnt sleep and I was having panic attacks about nothing. So I finally saw a doctor and she diagnosed me with anxiety, depression and stress... And referred me to see a psychologist but Ive had bad experiences with councilors when I was really bad at uni. So I got anxious about it and never went. I didnt want to be judged for what happened either. Ive tried to reach out to my partner, but she has anxiety too. If I lean on her too much she drops her bundle. She tells me shes happy and relentlessly reminds me that she wants to get married and have kids because were getting older. Ive told her that Im not having kids until I feel better, then I smile once and some how in her mind that makes me better. Otherwise we work really well together, except I never really feel like I feel in love with her. 7 years on Im still waiting for that spark. My family is fine, nothing bad ever really happened and we all talk, but it feels like they wouldnt notice if I wasnt around. They are so self obsessed, they call me to whine about the mundane things in there lives but never really ask how I am or if they do dont listen to what I have to say. I hate my job, sure most people do, but I find it so sole destroying. Feeling so shitty, I find it impossible to apply for others. I feel so trapped. I dont really have any friends I feel I can trust. At any rate I never let them see the depressed me, just my well practiced smiling facade. Ultimately I feel so incredibly lonely and isolated. Ive thought about leaving everything behind and taking a trip. Riding to Alaska and back again type thing.",

    "How to get through depression as a young adult ? Hello... Im new to reddit, and joined this sub because Ive been dealing with depression since the beginning of my teenage years and wanted to ask you guys and especially those who found a way out of depression how did you manage to get through it ? Im only 18, ik im still young and all but I feel so empty and worthless, crying and thinking about killing myself everyday. I dont have any objective to focus on in my life that could help me cheer up and fight for. Of course I spoke with therapists but didnt keep up with the sessions because everytime I talk about my problems and my past I start crying and panicking, which makes me think even more that Im helpless and makes me hate those sessions... Also, I find them useless for therapists say things that are really obvious, like if you want to have friends and go out with them, just ask people of your class to hang with you, well thanks, but the real issue is that I cant find the motivation and courage to talk to people since I always fear to be rejected. Thats for this type of answer I put an end on the sessions. My parents know that theres something off about me but Ive always done my best in hiding how bad I feel because ik they wouldnt understand, since all they do is making jokes about my sad facial expression when I eat with them... And I have literally 0 friends IRL who I could talk to about that, only online buddies that try to cheer me up sometimes, but I can tell that they get tired of it and I cant blame them for it, ik it is hard to try helping someone but things just remain the same. I really want to get out of this situation... Thank you for reading, and sorry for the grammar mistakes, Im french .",
    "How to get on top of the basic functioning that depression makes so hard? So, Im in one of those depressive spells where literally EVERYTHING feels like a struggle. Like, it takes me about an hour to even wake up and drag myself out of bed. Ive been up for hours now and cant bring myself to even go and brush my teeth. I havent showered in two days. I spend a huge chunk of time just sitting here scrolling, even though I dont really want to because theres far more fulfilling things I could be doing, but I simply dont feel capable of anything else. Ive been stuck in this cycle for a couple of weeks now and I just cant see a way out. Any tips on how to just... Function again?",
    "Should I use the psychological help service that my university provides for free? Lately Ive been feeling really low. I cant make myself leave the bed, I start crying out of the blue and everything is just so heavy. I think Ive always suffered from some kind of depression but Ive never been to therapy because I couldnt afford it on my own and my family didnt ever suspect anything. Now I live on my own in another city. Yesterday I discovered that my university provides psychological help for students for free. Do you think I should give it a go? Im a bit afraid because I dont know what to expect and I dont really know what to tell them when Ill be there. I know they dont provide help for very serious issues youll need a psychiatrist for that and I hope they dont take care for only university related problems. On the other hand, I have nothing to lose because its free. Did you ever try anything like that?",

I dont have many friends in the first place and I have hopes of finding a romantic relationship with a girl, but now I absolutely hate talking to people I dont know. Maybe I didnt talk to the right people, but I feel like its something more. I dont get very anxious in social situations, so I dont think it could be social anxiety.

    "Should I just indulge? Ive been working really hard on my mental health for several months now, pushing myself through difficult times to keep taking care of myself. Recently I started a mood stabilizer that has increased my appetite. During my depression, my appetite would decrease so it has actually felt really nice to crave food again. I dont get pleasure in most of the things that I used to enjoy, yet I have been keeping up on my diet, exercise, sleep, and social life despite all this. At this point I just of just want to indulge and take a break, but doing this doesnt really help in the long term. The only indulgence I can think of is pizza, and that is a very temporary one that will have a lasting impact on my physical energy for the rest of the day. Should I throw the thought of indulgence out of my mind? Should I just indulge a little? I have no idea at this point",
    "Regret &amp; moving on Ive never really had a connection with anyone besides her. We dated for a long time but we were young and I think she wanted to explore more. I...well I didnt. All I knew back then is that she made me feel more alive than I had ever felt. I loved talking to her. She got me and I got her. We parted though and now, years later, I still have never had what I had with her. She made me feel like I could do...anything. I didnt fully understand back then but I know now that I loved her and still do somehow... I havent seen her in years now but she plagues my dreams and I think about her daily. I know that now we are different people and that she likely has a guy that treats her well and makes her happy. That makes me happy, but it doesnt get rid of the regret that I didnt try harder or know how much she really meant to me. Im at my edge. I dont feel like anything is worth doing. I get that this is dramatic and maybe a little adolescent, but I really dont know how to make it stop.

    "My mother and I had an unsettling conversation in the midst of my depression, and I don't know how to feel... My mother quickly took me out of that daycare and felt so bad for leaving me there. Ive always remembered preschool, but Ive never known what actually happened in that building. After that event, the teens were arrested, and since today, that building had been shut down for 11 years. The next one, the first one I recall, was when I was in elementary school. I was in kindergarten, and the teachers were very strict, and they had the worst principal I had ever seen. He had beaten, tortured, and yelled at many kids, including me. I was once beaten, dragged to the office, and tied to a chair for the rest of the day in my kindergarten year. My mother was pissed off as the school when she saw my bruise marks. When I heard this happened to me, I remembered and regained my perspective on that moment, and two others I now recall. Another time I remember that was mentioned to me was in that same school in about first or second grade. This one kid would bully me over and over, and he would beat on me if he ever caught up to me, and the teachers just let him. One day, I thought I had put up with this crap far too much and was beating that kids ass. It took four teachers to pull me off him. They told my mother to immediately come to the school for my actions, and she took me out for ice cream for standing up for myself, and we were pissed off about how the teachers just let bad things happen to kids at that elementary school. The last memory I remember was in that same year in that same elementary school. One time, I feel off the top of the slide in the playground and busted my head open on the pavement. I was bleeding everywhere, and I now remember how bad it felt. The teachers were just again, standing there. Not even helping, not even calling for emergency services. Just watching. They didnt even call my mother.",

    "Feeling Lost and Weak Hi there, um, I dont really know how else to start this, so Im just gonna go, okay? okay. Ive struggled with severe anxiety and depression for basically my whole life. Or maybe not my whole life, its hard to remember, but definitely after my mother died. Car accident. Nasty business. I was 12, I saw it happen. I think Ive been broken ever since then. It got worse and worse and worse over the course of a decade. I went from honors student, gifted, to dropping out of college. My brain felt like it was clogged up with glue. But I told myself it was all my own fault, that I was just lazy, selfish, immature. Making excuses. Ive seen some doctors, therapists too, most of them were incredibly unhelpful. The stress of dealing with the medical system outweighed any help I got from them. Any medications they tried to make me feel better were duds at best. I went through a really, REALLY bad period about 34 years ago. I lost my entire group of friends, and let myself be abused by my partner for far longer than I should. I turned to selfharm, it was the lowest point Id been in my life. I still see the scars when I look in the mirror. But then I started to get better! I got new friends, got a job, allowed myself to be proud for once. I stopped self harming, swore never to again. Even after getting sexually harassed by my thankfully ex boss, even after losing my grandfather to cancer, I kept it together...for about a year and a half. Almost exactly one year ago I got hit by a car as I was crossing the street. Physically I was mostly unharmed, but it brought back all those memories from the accident where I lost my mother. I started becoming irritable, lethargic, occasionally manic, and the panic attacks...at one point I was having full panic attacks ever single day. I knew I needed help, but I felt powerless to get it. I had to leave my old clinic because the stopped taking my insurance.",

    "I can't handle sexualization double standards So, I happen to be a gay dude. And, I think I am going insane from not knowing how to handle the fact that males in media are never ever allowed to be sexualized the same ways females are all the time. Males showing off their ass and legs, wearing thongs or tights or fetishizing impractical clothes designed for the purpose of being fetishizing with skinrevealing stuff, and have them pose in compromising positions... thats never ever allowed. Yet, it happens with female characters all the damn time. I am 32 years old, and been speaking openly about this for many, MANY years. Ive had all sorts of explanations being told for why this is the case. And no matter how much its explained to me, it still pisses me off we dont get exceptions from the rules. I got most recently triggered by this today. I was sitting with some other dudes, and they happen to be straight. Suddenly, one of them starts a Youtube music video on the TV in front of us, and its one where tons of females are oversexualized, while NONE of the males are at all sexualized. I pointed it out, and the dude playing it first says I should ignore that and focus on the music. I said I cant. He then said hes sure theres stuff like that with dudes as well. I said I have been looking for it and never ever found anything. He then said I should be at least happy for HIM for getting this. At that point, I just broke and had to leave. I hate how I cant let go of this obsession. I hate not being able to just let it go and be happy. But a part of me doesnt want to let it go, because the double standard is driving me insane and makes it feel like only heterosexual dudes deserves being catered to. Please, help...

    "Almost 20 years of social anxiety, how do I go on? So Im trying to get over social anxiety for almost 20 years now, 18 of them spent running around from one therapist to another and nothing helped. Im going to another psychiatrist in a few days, and while I was the one to set the appointment I still feel theres no point. I tried CBT, pills, and was once arrested and voluntarily hospitalized for making a dangerous post. Is there anything specific I should say to the therapist? At this point they just send me to a different psychologist every time but I somehow manage to be too hard for them to get through to. I. E. one psychologist, every meeting, asked what are you thinking about as I was staring at the carpet waiting for them to speak, my answer was always simply nothing, as it really was nothing, I just shut off thought if theres no conversation, and it went like this until I got hospitalized where the psychologists in the hospital told me to stop making appointments with her. At any rate, 18 years of therapy, my social anxiety can probably be compared to selective mutism with how severe it is, what do I do? Overall, I quit my job with no desire to find a new one, lost interest in most of my hobbies, lost interest in improving myself because it didnt make me feel better at the end lost weight, listened to 40 books, tried out MMA, tried singing lessons, went to the gym, worked at a hotel to try and get my social anxiety solved, reconnected with old friends and then lost the connection with them after burning out. I know of 0 people that went to therapy and claimed it helped them. Every single one that I asked said its just a scam and at this point I can only agree, the success rate is just too low to justify wasting time on it, especially since I already wasted 18 years.",

    "How do I muster the energy to cook and eat, especially at the end of the day? Does anyone have tips or psychological tricks for getting yourself to eat regularly, especially at dinner? Im pretty good about eating on days when I have classes college student. I always eat before class so I can be energetic and focused and because stomach grumbles are embarrassing. I always have a healthy big breakfast. My problem is with weekends and dinner. Im usually mentally tuckered out after classes and interacting with people and rush to get home. When I come home, all I can do is curl up in my bed and maybe do homework in bed. Even doing something small like changing into PJs and brushing my teeth is very tough. Taking time to prep food and eat it is just a lot of mental effort, even if its just microwaving leftovers. I also live with others  I feel safe in my room but going into the kitchen is leaving my safety zone. My roommates are great but at the end of the day I really dont want to see anyone except maybe my best friend. When he comes over for dinner on occasion I feel motivated to cook and eat, but he usually has evening classes or work so I cant always rely on his presence. Or if Im out with friends and were getting fast food I can eat because I dont have to put in any effort and Im outside anyways. And weekends are really tough because I hate leaving my room just for food and I dont feel the same need to eat without classes to attend or things to do. So I end up eating one very hasty big meal of sandwiches or something when I get really hungry. Can anyone relate? Any psychological tricks people have for making themselves eat and get ready for bed? When I was living with family someone would usually tug me to the dinner table at night, but no one does that to me in college  I find it difficult to stay at a healthy weight for this reason. Its really easy to drop a few pounds when Im under additional stress some weeks I just cant do dinners at all.",

His dad said he hates him and told him to die because of high medical expenses. He said that he cannot be in a relationship because of his depression and said he probably will never fix himself because he is depressed to the point that he will never be fixed. Since the beginning of our relationship he said he was dealing with depression. He also said he will leave his parents house after the summer for college which made him upset. He wanted to leave as fast as possible. He told me that his dad abused him in front of his extended family and nobody saved him. This made him extremely depressed. He said rn is not the right time to be in a relationship and I completely understand why he is doing that. He said that he still has feelings for me and that he will never be happy with me if he doesnt love himself. I completely understand his stance and I gave him space. 1.

Part of why its hard to talk about is because i can only imagine the eye rolls when hearing about some rich kid complain that hes struggling when people are probably in 10x worse situations than me.

I think if i told most people what im going through they would just say im an overworrier and overthinking, but at this point im tired of life just sucking. Im tired of relative failure my whole life. And like i said im tired of only being so good at putting negative thoughts about myself in the backburner and not allowing them back into my usual frame of mind. They just never fail to come back and haunt me. The only way i can continue push forward is to find some self worth. I dont even know why i came to this sub.

Maybe as an opportunity to learn more about it because of my long reluctancy to ever face my depression head on and always dance around it and pretend to not let it affect me unless im in an environment where its safe to do so, which is just by myself. Thanks to anyone with any kind of insight, positive or negative. Ive tried to always be a realist with myself despite my issues in conjuring up some sense of self worth.",

    "I think I messed up trying to make sure my kids had a different childhood than i did. Sorry for the rant and sorry for the grammar, I feel like I just hit a damn wall ! I have 3 kids I grew up in a toxic family mom and dad divorced, seen my dad get locked up a lot my mom never being around because she worked so much. I always wanted my kids to have a better life than me, you know the American dream mom and dad that stayed together. I didnt want them becoming a statistic, I guess the toxic thing never went away. My husband and I have known each other since 1999, his dad died in March of 99 and my dad April of 98 we did a lot of stupid shit drugs and staying drunk and all kinds of dumb stuff. We broke up right after he turned 21 because he didnt want me in his life, I caught him cheating. Well a drunken booty call in October I ended up pregnant, I was happy and we  tried  to work it out, he left me high and dry for most of my pregnancy and the first 2 years of our sons life. Toxic family told him I was sleeping with everything that had a penis so our son wasnt his, his mom paid for a paternity test came back he is 99.9999999 the father  duh I knew that. Stupid me went back again to him, we moved in together he lied to me every chance we are very toxic for each other. We got married in 2006 had a kid 2007, from 2007 till 20112012 something like that he cheated again and made me feel like it was my fault, he lied to me about everything! But he promised hed be better and he was always sooo very sorry. Fast Forward a couple years his best friends dad died when I was going to leave him and take the kids, he begged me to stay I stayed. We hand another kid 2015 so I figured that was a sign telling me to stay things would get better. But all the things that could go wrong went wrong more lies, we lost our house our car and everything. He sucked at money he would spend spend spend stuff got cut off left and right got into them payday loan shit.",
    "Mental Illnesses aren't real...? My friend told me that mental illness wasnt real. Ive been suffering from Depression and Anxiety Disorder for the past 4 years. What he said, hit me really hard. He said, in the past people never had such things, he said only the new generation is too weak, that they use mental illness as an excuse to get out of things. And right now, its really sending me on a downward spiral. I feel so miserable. I dont want to feel this way, but I do. And if it doesnt exist, then was all these years of medication and therapy for nothing? Has my life just been a huge excuse? Im so confused right now, someone please make some sense.",
    "My girlfriend left me immediately after I began to talk about our relationship and what has been bothering me The past 5 months have been pretty damn great. I had an amazing girlfriend who was the first to actually seem to care about me. Little thoughtful actions here and there, it was so nice. But then i noticed a disconnect in her. It came out of the blue. Not wanting to be touched and becoming easily angered and frustrated with me. I brought up what i have been noticing and asked what she thought about it. And she replied something along the lines of im completely over this, bye. Just out of the blue... i cant comprehend what just happened. I dont know where this came from. I just think i wasnt enough for her, and she probably has better guys lined up waiting for her. Ive relapsed into my dark self. Shutting out everyone and not treatung myself well. I cant feel pain anymore and my mind is in a state of uphoria. Im at work now just staring into nowhere, no will to do my job or anything at all. I thought i had found someone special that i would be with for a long time. I was happy and she seemed happy too. I have so many questions....",
    "19 years old and its pretty obvious there's no reason to go any further Just graduated High School May 2019 and turned 19 at then end of September but now that Im finally done with school whats next for me? Working as a slave for 50 years? Or putting myself thousands of dollars behind just to go to college setting me back years just to still be a slave anyways? Id rather be dead than do that. I work at a pizza place making 8.75hr and live with my parents. My brother and I want to move out but I cant imagine doing that because thatll require me to find another job to enslave myself in and thats just not how I want my life to go on. Ive seen plenty of threads here on Reddit talking about how they cant keep doing this life of working all day coming home exhausted then sleeping and doing it all over again. Like I said Im 19 and I feel exhausted just working 6 hours a day, Im still a teenager I should be running around young wild and free enjoying life. I sleep about 1214 hours a day and I still take naps and otherwise Im alone in my room playing videos games just to keep my mind off this hellbent reality I was given or typing shit on Reddit because I feel so helpless that I need someone else on the internet to see if they can give me any advise. I have absolutely no social life, never had a girlfriend, still a virgin and unbearably lonely plus the realization that I either must be a slave for the rest of my life or a worthless homeless nobody on the street has caused me to become deathly depressed. I barely even eat because Im too depressed to even crave food, I can tell Im hungry but mentally I have no interest in food unless Im smoking weed. Ive tried meditation and have a strong interest in psychedelics for personal development but all thats done is make me realize just how fake and unreal this 21 century society really is. Id rather live in the wild foraging for food like a monkey over working my ass off for hours a day just for money green paper that people think is so good and meaningful I just dont understand.",

I am slipping into a very dangerous world again where I am kind of staying alone and having recurrent episodes of going to my dreaded balcony. I am coping by taking a shot of diazepam and whisky. Its gone to the point that now I can barely sleep in a week easily for more than 4 hours a night and I am constantly fighting people all around. If I dont have someone around I get delusional that I am at fault and this constant selfloathing and a sense of not having done enough is driving me crazy to the point that I think I am worthless. I am also professionally undergoing a transition to a new role and in between, I fought with a lot of my close buds and a couple of my relatives and this is now showing on my face and I can barely smile now. This is a sad state of affairs and I am now seeking professional counselling online with people who have undergone this. I think I fucked up quite bad this time and I really need someone to talk to. Friends who I thought would understand have kind of given up on my constant emotional outbursts and I have now shut myself in. I had a really rough start to this year and things have been very bad at home and I have been all solo on this and I have got myself into situations where I have been super drunk and tried to OD on any tablet I could find.

She started therapy sessions and told me she feels really unhappy. As someone who struggled with depression myself I understand which is why Im so conflicted. I want to be there for her but I dont know if she wants me to. I dont want to smother her but I want her to know she has my full support and Im here for her for anything she needs. I was debating whether to ask her if she wants me to come live with her again but she was the one that suggested to stay in our own places again because it would be better for our relationship. Im just terrified of her breaking up with me because she wants to sort herself out. It would break me. Should I ask her if she wants me to go back?

    "F 15 struggling with depression and feeling hopeless. I feel like I have no one to talk to. Any advice? Hello Reddit. for a little backstory, Im 15 years old and I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety just over two years ago. It has definitely gotten worse sense then, and I have not talked to a counselor since. Last November, I dropped out of my high school to begin home schooling with a tutor due to social anxiety and my depression hitting a low point. Though I enjoy the environment and freedom that comes with home schooling much better, it does get very lonely. The only people I talk to now are my long distance boyfriend, a couple online friends, and my family who are very busy with their own work and school Along with my family being busy, I hardly ever mention my depression to them. If I do, I feel like Im wasting their time and theyll be disappointed in me. My depression has gotten increasingly worse over the past few months. Ive always been skinny, but Ive lost a significant amount of weight to the point its unhealthy. I have no appetite, no desire to do anything, and no one to talk to. With the start of summer, my day consists of laying around and watching TV or playing video games. Even if plans do come up, physical symptoms of anxiety like panic attacks, head aches, and stomach aches typically prevent me from going. My boyfriend wants me to see a counselor, But Im hesitant because the one I had previously didnt help much, and was very expensive. I worry that by asking my parents for help, with my anxiety, depression, and poor eating habits Ill be wasting their money and time. At the same time, Im afraid that if I continue to sit here and do nothing I wont live to see my 16th birthday. What should I do? Any tips on getting help and finding meaning and motivation in life at a young age?",

Today my neighbour played Video Games by Lana Del Rey and it just started me thinking of loss. Losing people. If I believe that deathbreaking up means goodbye forever, it becomes unbearable to go on. I had a fight with my first boyfriend. Im wondering if I could cope with a break up. I think breakups are harder than losing someone cause they died.

That is not to say that I disagree with these measures whatsoever, but like so many other people, being isolated is damaging to my wellbeing.

I have been extra low these past few days due to my own depression, miserable job, chemical swing from sobriety, and family stuff, all happening at the same time.

I am trying to break down this idea bc it doesnt benefit me. I am doing my best but my best is just so so so shitty compared to any average person. I want to get better.

    "I'm not sure how to tell my mother I'm depressed My parents fought and mentioned my problems and blamed one another and it was difficult. For those curious my parents didnt divorce they apologized with each other and made up After I had arrived home from the counsel meeting I had a talk with both my parents. It was funny because my dad asked me if he could see the cts and told me he used to have depression like me and told me he understood. My mom on the other hand was informed by the counselor I was recommended to see a therapist and my mom said, her words teens hitting their puberty stage. The counselor once again pushed the idea of meeting a counselor and had a small heated debate with my mom about it. My mom backed off and said she would meet one and left with me. We got in the car and the first thing my mom mentioned was that I wasnt going to see a therapist. She said a bunch of things about being upset she didnt know I was going through this and thought it was just me being pubescent but ultimately she was telling me she didnt believe in mental issues. She told me I wasnt depressed and that I was just pubescent. Grade 9 and 10 ended relatively smoothly with no self harming just minor break downs and uncontrollable mood swings. Grade 11 came and my previously clean record had relapsed. To this day despite having recently graduated I still unfortunately self harm as a way to cope from unstable emotions. The counselor told me I was depressed and have anxiety and others who listened to my rants and stories have told me similar to what the counselor said. Im not sure what to do seeing I have doubts that I have depression because Im comparing my issues to others and I currently dont understand myself with constant emotional numbness and random attacks of sadness. I wish to seek therapy but cant without my parents approval. My mother still doesnt believe in mental disorders and issues and I cant talk to her about these issues because she will take them as me talking back to her. I cant talk to my dad either because he will end up talking to my mom about it. Should I talk to my mother about my depression, self harm and seek therapy?",

To me they were always empty words in what Im now thinking was a cry out for help but seeing it through her eyes, why wouldnt she believe me, and why wouldnt this effect her.

My anxiety has a bad effect on my body and Im so scared Im going to throw away my new job that I love, and the great opportunities I have because I just cant bother to get up and go out the door. I dont know what to do. I just want the girl Ive loved for so long.",
    "Someone please help. My life is a mess at 29. Ive worked hard and accomplished some what success at uni etc. Ive always been in a relationship but theyve all ended. I started dating someone 4 years ago and lately due to messed up work schedules and far distances from where we live weve gotten distant and she broke up with me. She confessed to kissing her work colleague who is her best friend at work. Last week. Then she said shed try to make it work, that she chooses us, she loves me, she doesnt know how to live without me etc. yesterday she said she needs to be alone and she dont think she can do it am tomorrow. She feels withdrawn from our relationship and she isnt physically attracted to me anymore and still has feelings for her friend. This girl has been the sweetest person ever. Shes truly a kind soul. Weve treated each other really well through the usual ups and downs. I feel like Ive lost everything. Im sad for what we couldve been. Im lost and feel empty and my whole world is collapsing. Since she broke the news to me last week about the kiss Ive been extremely depressed and sad and just cant wait to go to sleep but that is useless cuz I get up thinking about her. I dont know what to do. I just really want her back in my life. How can the person who literally loved me unconditionally just not want us anymore? Please can someone please reach out. Im falling apart",
    "does anyone else only have bad days? most depressed people have ups and downs, good days and bad days. I only have downs and bad days. I havent experienced any periods where I felt normal or okay in at least 2 years. before that I was severely depressed too but Id still have some good days every now and then. but now Im never at peace, I never enjoy anything, I never feel well. is anyone else unlucky enough to feel suicidal all day every day or am I just not meant for this world anymore?? maybe it really is my time to go",
    "Loneliness, sinking down, and... I am extremely depressed now. This depression sinks me to the bottom today. I am so desperate. If someone in the DFW area reads my post, please DM me. While I was scrolling down my contacts, I found that no one I can contact and ask to meet with me tonight. Those who I have trusted and befriended... I could not call them. I thought that they would laugh or scoff at me. When I was a teenager, I had the protection, socalled parents. However, I feel that I am alone in this world. One night, I called one of my sisters and poured out my emotion. Since I trusted her so much, I told her everything. However, she ignored me and said, Hey, bro, I am so busy with my life. And do not complain about your life. Also, my life is so tough! So could you not throw away your emotion to me? I am not your trash bin! Often, I relied on the counseling service. But, I found that Counseling does not help but exacerbate my depression. The problem of professional counseling is... the counselors have their own frame. And also, at this point, I do not have enough money to receive more counseling services. So, I dont ask for any money but emotional support at this point. I feel that my emotion is collapsing and sinking to the bottom of the abyss.",
    "I thought I was getting better but it’s been extra rough lately I felt like for the first time in years, I felt consistently happyat peace for a solid week or so minimal bad thoughts, good vibes all around. I wasnt kept up every night thinking or doing trash habits. But suddenly i crashed and felt trapped, pessimistic, and done all over again. Maybe its part of the process, but its still going and I cant find my groove back from that week. I feel really alone since I dont want to bother people around me and the ones I trust have a lot on their hands rn so its kinda bad timing all around. Over the past few years its gotten bad and started to impact my health id pass out a lot, have panic attacks, all the jazz. I just got put on antidepressants for the migraines and all. But Im sure it isnt that since the pills shouldnt start working yet it hasnt even been a week. Im kinda on the edge of just dropping college and just not trying anymore bc its so hard to keep up my grades with all this. Plus the pressure doesnt help from solid 4.0s and As to barely making the minimum  I guess it kinda was a rant but also, what do you guys do to get better? Or If youve gone through it, what happened for you Its kinda been a cycle but this one was the longest Ive felt okay Thank you for anything",

Most things seem worthless, I dont want anything. I just eat, sleep, spend time online. I havent done a single productive thing in 2 weeks.

Im just done with life, and as much as I want to end it, Christianity wont allow it. The very thing thats saving me even with my parents I wouldve killed myself a LONG time ago if it werent for my Christian faith is also imprisoning me.

I tell her all kinds of positive things and how she can still chase her goals. I keep telling her that its her life and it shouldnt matter what they say but she totally convinced herself that she is good for nothing. She is always bullied by her parents like this.

    "I am depressed and I lost all of my friends. I feel so alone. This is not a great thing to say but I was frustrated and panicking at the time. Katie was with Amy and another girl at the time, and I thought Katie wouldnt show anyone and this was a private convo my mistake for thinking that would be true. Tonight, after feeling the gratification of helping her, Katie decided to tell me that the other girl she was with and Amy read what I said. I genuinely didnt say anything super mean, just that I was frustrated that as soon as she moves back, I get dropped. Katie told me the other girl she was with said that is just disrespectful and out of line. and Amy said, Im glad I know how she really feels about me. Sorry for the long story but now, I just feel like nothing. I feel that I mess up every friendship. But at the same time, I am frustrated with the fact that if they do anything to hurt me, it means nothing, but if I do anything I am automatically this horrible human being. They act as if they have done nothing to me. I left my group message with all my friends, which was my main source of support and I stopped talking to the boy who finally told me he has lost all romantic feelings for me. He talked to me every day for about a month after he ended things and said he still had feelings for me for the longest time. I feel so alone and like I have hit rock bottom once again. I feel suicidal but I know myself enough to know I wont do anything. I dont want to die I want the pain and hurt to stop. I just wish people would care for me the amount I care for them. I wish people actually understand that they hurt me and, not to be selfcentered, but put themselves in my shoes for just a second.",

    "I feel like shit after I stopped taking pills I love in abusive family and Im traumatized because of it. I cant focus in school, cant ready, every contact with humans makes me anxious and drains me out of energy despite that I used to be social butterfly when younger. I was on Zoloft for 6 months and it didnt really help me until I started taking 75mg doses. Then I stopped taking it because of my parents pressure. Taking meds for mental problems isnt normal form them. Eventually I had enough of their trash talk and gave it up. I regret it since then my symptoms are getting worse and worse. I got more suicidal, my emotions are vague and I feel exhausted all the time. It drives me crazy. I think my mother canceled meeting with psychiatrist and I dont want to dose meds by myself. I did one stupid thing and thats enough. What do I do, what should I tell them?",

Happened gradually over the years due to nose aging and shifting after a rhinoplasty when I was a lot younger. Feeling very alone and scared. Terrified of surgery and what could go wrong. And picking the right surgeon. But also cant breathe which has declined the quality of my life. Feel stuck in catch 22 hell. Revision surgery again is worst nightmare for HSP, highly anxious, depressionprone, peoplepleaser and controlfreak type of person. Almost did it twice but got really bad vibes from interaction with a surgeon right before surgery so backed out. Shaken up from that negative experience. Grateful for any support, advice and stories on anyone that found the courage to do a complex and scary surgery all on their own.",

I feel like Im losing autonomy of my mood and its making everything impossible again. I cant focus on work or my relationship.

    "I could really do with some kind words. So I just got off the phone with my GP. Shes prescribing me Prozac. Ive never been on psych meds before. Im 17 and have struggled with increasingly worse severe depression since I was 11. Im undiagnosed as of now because Im only this last 2 months seeking help for the first time kind of a doordie situation. Im from the UK and NHS mental health services are dire. My GP essentially told me that due to being 17 and a half years old, Im too young for adult mental health services and too old to be referred to the adolescent services. She listened to me talk and on the spot said that I sound like I have PTSD I honestly feel like I do as well, but Im not prepared to say I have it wo formal diagnosis which I feel was way too quickly to say something like that. Basically the next half year ill be monitored to make sure the Prozac doesnt finish me off, because in people of my age it can make suicidal feelings get worse. I feel so lost. She said I cant see a psychiatrist or a clinic or anything until Im 18, which is 7 months away, so Im just put on meds and stuck waiting. I feel such lack of support or urgency... I literally want to die and theyre just like heres some pills, come back when youre 18. I dont know, maybe Im complaining too much. I just felt like they were worryingly quick to give me meds and tick me off the list. Im super overwhelmed right now, there wasnt even any talk of side affects or really what to expect, apart from by the way, these pills make you even more suicidal sometimes.",
    "Therapy anxiety I dont know if this us the right place to ask this but here goes nothing. I had therapy a few years ago, combined with medication, which ended up worsening my mental health and adding extreme anxiety with therapistsfear of even talking to them to the list because of previous shitty experiences with them was wrongly diagnosed and treated. After two years of my condition getting worse and worse to the point of daily meltdowns, mood swings, and other problems wont go into details because even writing this as anon on here makes me uncomfortable and anxious I decided that enough is enough and I need to do something. We me and my mother were recommended a therapist, since I didnt want to go to someone with no recommendations and reviews. I wanted to contact the therapist. Really wanted. But didnt, because every time I thought of it I was on the verge of tears and freak out for who knows what reason. Since its been more than two months already, my mum gently asked if she could help shes very understanding and trying her best to support me for the past few years. So, I asked her to contact the therapist asking about consulting daughter, age 20 me. To which the therapist answered that shes an adult and can contact me directly if she needs therapy. My mums reply about me having issues with communication and asking her to write were ghosted by therapist. So, my question is. Did I fuck up? Im overanalyzing everything, I know, but was asking my mum to make the first move to contact the therapist the wrong thing to do? I dont know how to deal with this situation. Maybe someone had similar experiences?",
    "Shitty New Years Worst new year ever My ex fiancé decided to added me on snap and make me relive everything until 3 am when I literally just got over a few days ago? Its been 6 months of radio silence, an email from me, calls with no answer. We were raising my son together his he was 5 months old and we heard nothing from him. His excuse was the same one that he used all throughout our relationship to not be there for us work is killing him. He owns a pizza restaurant.. and hes a control freak so he basically does everything himself even though he pays employees then stressed himself out because hes doing everything and working 16 hours a day. It ended with me asking for 1 hour a week of couple counselling because I know I have issues but he does too and needs to be able to make at least one hour a time a week for his family if it was ever going to work. His message was  I miss you. happy New Years and then from there it turned into him going on about his how shitty his life is without me.. even though apparently I was the reason he had no money ever and now its the same. I live off of less than half of his income, supporting my son in a two bedroom as opposed to his one bed and somehow I have savings, even though I do have some bad spending habits  fast food delivery , and grocery delivery because sometimes Im too anxious to leave the house and I need to cook for my son. Anyway so that was a mess. And then my friend with benefit that I was falling for.. that I thought maybe felt the same because he was driving an hour to see me, bringing me starbucks, offering to teach me how to drive and cook better, talking about maybe meeting my kid in the future, talking about taking me out clubbing after covid cause Ive missed out being a young mom with no help had a New Years party.. didnt even think to invite me and posted on his snap grinding with some girl 10x hotter than me.. so I hate myself so much for thinking maybe I was special, maybe I meant something to someone in 2020 nope..",
    "Needing Time to Heal But BF doesn’t get it....am I in the wrong? So after that, and our weird visit, it felt like he was just making me feel pressure and stress. I felt like I couldnt handle his needs, his constant need to tell me over and over how he didnt understand and how he felt bad for not fixing me. I then decided that I needed to take time apart from him to figure out how to get back on track for me, to try and get better and heal. I realized that trying to be in a relationship with him at the moment someone who just isnt in my everyday life to understand firsthand my situation and then doesnt hearappreciate what Im saying, then freaks out that he cant fix me, etc, just is not conducive to me getting better. I told him all of this, told him I love him but I need to focus my attention right now on me and my health, this is what I need to do to heal. I also told him I cant give our relationship the attention it needs right now. We took a few weeks not communicating as much. When Id check in and say hi, he didnt ask me how I was feelingtreatmentanything about my life at all. He literally responded to a simple Hi, hows your day going by responding with a giant text about how he was not managing it so well, how he was struggling etc, etc. I ultimately now feel angry bc of his behavior. He then asked to have a phone call to discuss his feelingshow bad he feels without me in his life and I told him I cant do that bc theres nothing more I can do, he has to accept the facts as they are, there is no point to getting into another emotional discussion where all he says is how bad he feels. I dont think hes a jerk I think hes just ignorant and literally lacks the ability to understand. But at this point I feel like this is a problem I cannot get past if Im to have any future with him. Ive become so angry too lately bc I feel like even though hes unable to deal with this, instead of trying to educate himself, learn more and understand, hes just being selfish. Does anybody think Im being insensitive, or unfair?",

    "Just need to talk to anyone So I have been a part of this subreddit for idk how long, but never posted anything because I felt like my problems are not important. But now I want to post something. I actually have typed this post out several times this week but always ended up deleting it. I dont want to be a burden to anyone. Im gonna start with what happened today. This story has nothing bad happening but it caused me mental pain. Im typing this out because the four hours I spent with my fiancé has been the longest I have felt happy this week and I just need to talk to anyone right now. Me and my fiancé went to the gym this morning. He had to pick me up due to we both still with our parents and havent told anyone about our engagement we want to surprise them and are waiting to by financial set. We went to the gym worked out for an hour or two then we went out to do some errands. I was bringing my resume to places applied to and my fiancé was my ride. After that he got on the freeway and we were just driving and making jokes. I was telling him a funny story about a quest I did in a game Im playing. Then I got a phone call from my mom. She wanted to know where I was and when Im going to be back. Now I know this is seems like a red flag but she only asked because she had to get a new work uniform and my other siblings were going with her and no will be home. That doesnt seem bad but my moms stepdad lives with us and he is unable to much he can walk and stuff but has a hard time remembering things. So someone has to be home with him. I said ok and we started to head back. This when I noticed that my fiancé was upset. I asked whats wrong, it turns out that he had a surprise for me. He was taking to a sushi place that he promised to take a while back. He also had plans for the whole day for us but wanted to surprise me with it. I started feeling like I ruined the whole day. His plans and the way he described it made it sound like today was gonna be the most perfect dateday.",

    "Anti-Depressants effect on sex? Hey Ive only just recently lost my virginity and Ive been on anti depressanta for a few months. I heard they could make it harder to cum and that has been the case even with masturbation. It took longer to finish after I started the treatment. Well when I lost my virginity this week I just dint finish, as Ive had two sessions of 40min and cant finish. It dosent go soft or anything, I care about my partner and she is trying to fulfill my needs in bed so its not that. Also the sensation is dulled, Ive heard sex is supposed to feel amaizing but I felt little to nothing in the way of pleasure at first. The second time I had been off anti depressants for a day and did feel some more pleasure but It was dulled. When I mean pleasure I think its more accurate to say stimulation.

So, anyways... Ive been struggling with mental problems that are incredibly similar to common clinical depression symptoms loss of motivation, emotional numbness, insomnia, suicidal thoughts, anxiety attacks, low selfesteem, and some more we dont have to bring up since I was about 10 and continuing since then. Nobody has ever taken me seriously, and I feel worthless constantly, so Ive just put a bandaid on my problems and tried to ignore them. But its gotten to the point where Im crippling myself to a noticeable degree and I cry for days on end. So Ive decided to finally seek help. I think Ive found a therapist that interests me but... What do I do? I mean, I know how to bring up my insurance and payment methods in a professional manner but thats all I know I can do. Do I bring up my problems before the appointment so that she can be prepared, or do I wait? Whats the formality usually like for these things? And besides all this just to get the ball rolling, is there anything else I need to do that isnt obvious? I just want to get better so my family isnt so worried about me but I sincerely dont know.

    "Have recently started to come to terms with the fact that I'm a loser. While I am badly depressed, that is not the depression talking Other than the basement and the parents I meet the exact stereotypical requirements of a loser. While I have my reasons for the way I turned out I wont invoke them here so as to render them excuses. The fact is I have a personality like a moldy sponge covered in cooling diahria. Thats not all thats holding me back though aside from a badly wrenched spine and triple hernias two of which are inguinal, the third one in my navel has never been patched my asthma has somehow gotten so bad that they briefly identified it as COPD. I dont think Im quite staring down the barrel of that last depressive step yet but Im at the stage where I see things for what they are and I feel them closing in. I live off of supplemental income Im being thrown out of the room of the house Im renting tomorrow to if not the street, than a rundown motel for a few days then the street. I have applications through for apartments that I had to rely on a friend that I basically leech off of to make for me because I just cant mentally handle having to do stuff like that for myself. I dont drive. I have no actual family most who meet me hate me straight off and the rest always do eventually so maybe thats ironically for the best. Bottom line Im waking up to myself, and realizing that I just cant me anymore. Im not suicidal yet but I can hear it out there on the wind out there. Yet nor do I particularly care about self improvement. I just wanna be able to hack a passably comfortable life on my own merits with some real friends Im not bleeding of their energy and resources who can honestly say theyd come to my funeral and actually mourn. In a nutshell I want the misery to stop. I have no actual skills in much of anything, nor the basic knowledge of even how to obtain them while these things may not have been my fault to start with it seems the blame has in my thirties at least partially shifted to me.

Im not going to but I cant stop thinking about it. My life feels worthless. I dont feel like I help anyone. Obviously we cant see too much of our family right now but that wouldnt matter because we dont all get along. My dad re married when I was 14. They had another kid. Same exact birthday as mine although 17 years apart. She is the golden child. They even had a drive by birthday thing for her to sing happy birthday. Im under 26. Dont want to say my exact age. I get Im older and I get the older you get birthdays kinda get less exciting. But I feel like dirt on the ground to people around me. I feel lonely and I feel sad I dont feel excitement. Again its just another day but it feels shitty. Maybe its the memories I miss I dont know. Just wanted to get it off my chest. Im scared to wake up tomorrow. Im scared to have another year like I just had. I dont think I can survive it. I barely survived this one. This isnt a oh I hope Reddit wishes me happy bday for validation post. I just feel like sometimes on here I can share and get it out there. I dont really have an outlet. Thank you for listening.",
    "She Said I Can't Have What I Want Ive been suffering from depression for a very quite a while, but it has gotten worse during this pandemic. Ive spent so much time alone, and my LTR ended as well. I started with a new therapist about a month ago, because the one I had, though I liked her, kept rescheduling on me with very little notice. I felt like she didnt find our sessions as much of a priority as other clients, because she told me that the person before me ran over time and there was no time for me. Anyway, my therapist met with me today, and I have had a hard time connecting with her. First, she did not believe that I was raised by narcissistic parents. She felt it was my behaviors that were causing them to behave towards me the way they did and still do. Ive found I cant bring up family issues with her. Today, I was feeling extremely depressed because Ive been so danged lonely. I can go days without saying a single, solitary word to a human being. I crave human contact. I told her I was feeling worthless, useless, and unloved. I told her I was questioning why I was even here on this Earth since it didnt seem to matter one way or another. She asked me what I wanted in this life. I said I wanted to be loved and accepted by others at least one special someone. She told me that was the wrong thing to ask for. I was being childish. She said people are unreliable and will let you down. I cant make them love me or accept me. So I needed to think of something else. This just increased my depression further. I cant expect to be loved? I shouldnt want to be accepted by others? Can anyone explain this to me? From all that I have learned, Love is a basic human need. Love is essential to life. Please help me...",
    "How do I stop being victimized? sorry for my English, not English speaker A friend asked me to send him a bike by a postal service. I was already with a lot of things in my head, i knew I had to wrap the bike, but couldnt find much cardboard. When I got to the place there was this dude that attended the postal service that i know from the start that just wanted to take advantage of me as people of low lifeclass usually do around here. I already was at a defensive state, and then he invented some extra fee for wrapping the bike. I knew what was going on. I played the fool and as i was too tired to get more cardboard, or wrap it, or have any trouble, i paid that illegal extra fee. But i felt really taken advantage of, and this guy also waved a knife around, so i would get intimidated. I was already intimidated just by being next to this low class douche that could get around with any shit he pulls, and i knew that for him i was just the next victim. funny thing is that i try to not react bad to low class people, so they dont ger offended, but now Im thinking this interaction was already spoiled by this low life thug, as the bad vibe i fell was all his act to take advantage of me. But i think that given all the options I knew everything that was going on, i handled him the fee and this extra fee... But of course now I feel really bad, i hate imagining this dude celebrating that he scammed another dude with this shit. I was afraid that if i did otherwise this low class people would damage the bike or something like that... And the sad thing is that they may do that either way. But at the moment i was also afraid of the bike safety. I felt it was a burden to react and just complain, but now i felt this blame, i felt like a coward that succumb to this low class guy intimidation, and this guy taken advantage of me. When something like this happen i always say next time i dont even care if everything goes to hell. But then this happens i take this solutions but the regretted as i feel as a coward or a fool.",
    "Making the same mistake years later. I knew she was back in town, later on I ended up at a house party where I got in to a very bad state with drugs and alcohol. And out of all the placed I could of met her again she walked in to the kitchen where I was dashing out lines of cocaine in a state where I could barely stand or speak. I tried telling her I wasnt the man I was when we first met, but of course she didnt believe it, why would she ? Somehow I managed to achieve some sort of success with her. We danced and kissed etc. But shes probably just lonely since coming back to town since most of her friends are gone away. We never had sex that night but I couldnt have sex even if I wanted to due to state I was in. I woke up next morning and all my feeling for her came back, all the love it took me years to forget, but I knew that it was over, it was just a one night thing. It crushed me. All these years breaking away from my habits wasted when it came down to a person it mattered. I was still the same lying drug addict in her eyes as I was 4 years ago. Its been a week and I feel empty, only emotion I have is constant hint of anger and sadness in me. I stopped eating or doing anything except working , I work 95 and then I go to my garage where I work on projects and drink alcohol until am I able to sleep. Maybe I am still the same scumbag I was 4 years ago. Iv been having suicidal thoughts but I know I cant do that since I need to look after my family. I would rather suffer myself then let my family suffer. At first I thought it was just a comedown from drugs since I havent touched them in so long. But I still miss her more and more everyday. I have dreams about her at night where we are happy together. I messaged her a few times but shes always busy and takes a long time to reply. Im just so lost, all these years to recover just to slip back into my old days when it mattered the most. She gave me an opportunity to fix what I once broke but instead I proceeded to ruin it further.",
    "I know what to do, I just can’t do it I know what I need to be happy. I need to stop smoking weed, I need to exercise, I need to eat better, to get on a good sleep schedule, to talk to people more, to actually open up to my therapist, to clean my house and do all of my work. Ive done it all before and Ill do it again. But I always end up back here. Square one. Unfortunately for me I stay at square one for months and I have like a few good weeks sometimes where Im doing better but it always spirals downhill to the point where I cant do anything and I lose all motivation. Im just too depressed. I know the mindset I need to have, I know I need to believe in myself, to focus on the positive, take my meds every day. Ive been doing those things...but nothing works. I dont want to spend my life like this but I dont know what else to do. Sometimes I cannot physically bring myself to do things or complete tasks. Its just too much. So what do I do?",
    "I'm so tired I was tired of it all, I was overwhelmed to the point where small mishaps with homework could break me. This continued for months, I just felt awful constantly it felt like there was always something small that would show up and throw me off again. I remember another break down about two months ago when I was out seeing colleges, I just stayed up awake for hours one night crying to myself and venting to some friends. Something about how I tried to hard to have things be better, I spent so long trying to draw, and write and do everything that I enjoy while balancing school but it just wouldnt work, it kept getting worse instead of better. I was just tired, I just wanted it to stop, I just wanted to be happy but it only got worse. It felt like there was no reason for any of this, I was just here feeling like shit for no reason, I wanted it to end so badly. Around this time the school announced their full time in person plan, leaving my parents and me too fight about whether or not I should go back in to school. The same arguments happened and eventually I was sent in again. The first day back was some of the most intense anxiety Ive ever felt, just pure feer and overwhelmingness about the very uncomfortable situation I was in. That leads me to now, the most recent random period of stress that makes me finally say I cant do this anymore. Three weeks ago review for the AP Lit exam started a standardized test final for a literature class, known for being very poorly designed and I realized our teacher taught my class next to nothing about literature the whole year and I was on my own to prepare. The whole overwhelming thing happened again, it just felt like my whole life would revolve around this pointless exam for about an entire month, leaving me with no time to do the few things that actually make me happy anymore. That night I went in the kitchen and just held a knife, I just sat on the floor crying for a while, I know I wouldnt do anything but the thought of it alone terrified me. I wanted it to stop, I just wanted this awful string of events to end already, yet whenever I got scared or overwhelmed all I was told was to get through it to summer, but I couldnt.",
    "Pl help.I am very emotionally fragile. I hate who I am right now. I spent a lot of time crying and affected by it. And just when I had slowly recovered from it, a family member on hearing what exactly happened made a remark that I think hes better than you, for the family which means that I am too impulsive and rude and emotional and is bound to create problems in a family. I still havent recovered from that. I didnt want to cry, because my uncle and I dont exactly see eye to eye and I wanted to disregard this remark and get going with my day. BUT i began to tear up the next second. I cried for hours. I hated myself. Do i wish to be rude? no. Am I this emotional by choice? no. Do feel crying is the solution to all my problems? no. And my family thinks otherwise for all the above questions I want to seek professional help. Having been wanting to for three years now. But heres the thing. I am from India. I am still in college. I live with my family and they provide for me. They will never accept depression as real and a therapist is a big NO. I can never open up to them about this and I cant secretly visit one, nor can I afford it myself. I am writing here because I want to change this. I dont want to be controlled by my emotions all the time, I dont want to use rudeness as defence. I am so insecure and I am desperately looking for ways to improve. tldr I am a depressed, insecure, self hating person who cries way too much and is controlled by her emotions and is desperately looking for ways to improve",
    "No one respects me or believes in me I have this close female friend who I like but I know probably doesnt like me in a romantic way. Ive asked before, and she turned me down. But shes probably the person Im closest too and who I trust the most in the world. But I figure she doesnt see a future with me because I dont have a career or because Im still hung up on my ex. And I cant go to Facebook or Snapchat anymore because it either gets misunderstood and I get messaged with concern, or I get completely ignored and feel rejected from it. I dont know. It really does feel like as a guy I can only be loved and sought after if I give some or create something that gets peoples attention. Im not loved or sought after for who I am. Thats why Im alone right now in my life, why I seem to be unsuccessful at dating or meeting people. It sucks because that feels like the way for me to get out of this funk that and seeking God. I just dont want another person to tell me to be happy alone, or to tell me to let go. The thing Ive wanted was for someone unprompted to tell me that I mattered to them, that I make their life better by being me. Ive told myself those things, but it fades away when I have less to show for a life I dont want to be living, because I cant right now make things come true or be the only one believing I have a future that seems impossible.",
    "I’m drowning and I don’t know what to do Sometimes I think that maybe I dont really know what I want. I hate it. I hate how I look at other people and hate them. I hate when they smile, I hate when they laugh I hate how fucking happy everyone else is. Im being left behind. I know I am, everyone is so far ahead of me and Im drowning in my own damn mind. I cant keep this up. I cant keep smiling and pretending Im cool with being the lonely asshole who stays in her room all day. Who only goes outside to go to class or to get some unhealthy shit that shell feel bad about ten minutes later. I dont think I want to die. I just... I want to be free. But maybe freedom is death for me. I want to hit something. I want to yell and scream but at the same time I just want someone to hug me and tell me that its okay and that I matter. But that wont happen. Not in a way thats genuine and real, its all fucking pretend to make people feel better and act like they actually care for the small lonely bitch who tries too hard to not care at all. If Im alone then maybe its better for me to leave anyway, fully embrace it instead of begging for some kind of helping hand. No one would really care if I go. I give them three months tops until I just become a distant name they remember every so often. Everything is so loud but painfully silent at the same time why cant it stop I want everything to just fucking stop. I tried to get help last year but they just pretended to care about me to. They read straight off a damn script. Didnt take long for me to figure out the pattern and say what I needed to get out. I dont know what to do anymore. I feel like this my final chance to ask for help before I go back into a hole I may not be able to escape from again. I dont trust anyone and those few that I do hole a level of trust for I dont want to burden them so I smile and play it off as some edgy joke.",

    "Idk what to do anymore This is a throwaway for a pretty good reason. I was constantly bullied from a very young age probably 6 to the time I was a sophomore in high school. I was manipulated into doing sexual things to my sister when I was 8 when I didnt know what was going on and she was 14 and knew what was going on. Ive had friends and my sister take their lives, i was sexually harassed and sexually assaulted in Highschool by a girl I had a few classes with, my last theee girlfriends have been abusive and manipulative. Even more that I just dont want to say even on a throwaway. Im not asking for pity so please I dont want any. I currently live alone with my kitten Leo. I have social anxiety, depression, ptsd, and Im just all screwed up in the head. I stopped taking medicine because it made me feel like a zombie and constantly made me sick.

    "The best discord friends I’ve ever had suddenly cut ties with me back in October. I’m really hurt bad and I can’t move on. I had so many amazing memories with them. I remember excitedly hurrying home from work every day to chat and play games with them. We shared jokes and memes all the time. We disagreed and argued sometimes, but isnt that how all friendships go? In OctoberI think the eighth, I got a DM from one of them. They called me emotionally manipulative and declared the friendship to be over. In addition, they said I couldnt do anything to reconcile with them the decision was final. They kicked me out of every discord server they moderated and I assume blocked me on all social media. They never told me what Im specific I did wrong. They never told me beforehand that something was going on. Right up until that DM I thought things were ok between us. I just feel so evil and disgusting and not deserving of life.

    "Am I Disabled Enough? So it sounds like a joke but this is a true anxiety. My story without getting into it because its not the point just so you understand where Im from. Warning for all kinds of trauma. I live in Australia and I grew up in an abusive house. Mum would verbally attack my dad and the kids, hed get drunk and beat her in front of us and around and around we go. Mum finally left him for good when I was 8 because my eldest sister turned fourteen and declared she wasnt going back and would keep me and my other sister with her at the halfway house. So mum got a government funded house and took off in search of a good time and a new husband leaving my two older sisters to raise me. they were 14 and 12 to my 8 at the time. Left alone days at a time, my sisters pulled cash in hand work to feed us. My dad got visiting rights so when we went over there we were fed and clothed and he spoilt us rotten especially me but in unhealthy amounts. eventually my sisters stopped going but I loved it because there I could stay up as late as I want never bathe eat myself sick on junk and watch whatever adult tv I wanted. All I had to do was agree mum was a Btch and leave dad alone to do whatever he wanted. meanwhile at mums place she found a miner to latch too with three kids of his own. so now we were six kids between 143 being left alone days at a time and sharing one room. two years later my elder sisters ran away, my father cut contact as it was too much to deal with my mother trying to see me which i learnt to forgive him as an adult but as a kid it hurt and we were in a slightly bigger house. it was me and my step sister in one room, my two step brothers in another and my parents in the last. again, my mother was not present, either sleeping, or out socialising or gambling or in the shed smoking. my dad either worked or joined her. Now I was the caretaker. Needless to say various abuse emotional verbal occasionally physical and by my teens Im pretty messed up. I latch onto my own escape in the form of my high school boyfriend.",
    "Any advices you would like to share on uplifting self esteem and self awareness ? I have been facing depression over the past couple of years but it only accelerated last 6 months when I lost my job and moved back with my narcissistic parents. Thanks to my over protective and overly concerned parents, I turned out to be an adult who cannot standup to himself, who turned out to be a weakling, lack basic social skills and more importantly does not have the faintest idea who he is, what makes him happy, or the very least what he wants to do with his life. I have been living suicidal over the past 2 months, researching on methods I could deploy to end this no good life, having no point in living. But to be honest, I guess somewhere down there, there is something that tells me that not all doors have closed. I recently had a quick convo with a therapist and with the intial analysis she put forward with my situation, she mentioned that the probable root caus,e that is prone for a quick fix is my lack of self awareness and self esteem. I felt that is true, because I sort of feel like I do not have an identity, like.. Having an opinion on somethinganything, having the strength to stand up to myself, knowing what it is that makes me happy, be it a hobby or an interest. I mean when I spend time with people, maybe friends, or colleagues. They tend to know a lot about the world. Some may be knowledgeble about basic things people should know, some maybe a youtube content provider or some other maybe a social point of source. I want to do something with my life as well like being good at something, but all I do is consume datainformation reddit,trivial information etc.. and not produce any maybe writing a blog because I cant understand what fancies me. ampx200B I want to make my life better, but I just dont know where to begin and I feel like so Lost !",

Since a kid this is how Ive been. I just dont know how to reinvent myself and become the real me all along. Ive left all my old employers without any reason of leaving, I ghost their calls and say Im busy. I just want to lie in bed forever and ever and never go outside again.

    "I need help While in the bootcamp, we rarely talked, living our separate lives. After I graduated bootcamp I moved to Washington State, to gain some world experience and she did the same thing, but interning in the Caribbean as a marine biology instructor. I started at this time having extremely unhealthy night terrors. I was still madly in love with her, I had a ring in mind from our first relationship and one night was exceedingly bad. The next morning I told myself that I would reach out to her, tell her the truth of what I was feeling. So I did. I told her about how much I missed her, my night terrors, why we separated and my insecurities about how she was feeling at the time. And I told her that I still loved her and either needed her in my life or I had to completely cut her out because my mental health was really bad. These night terrors are demons like no other. I hop no one has to be afraid to sleep because they may experience watching and hearing their ex get railed by guy after guy. It truly is a haunting experience. After I reached out she told me she had missed me, and felt the same. We talked about what things would be different and how we would be able to go on from there. She had 2 months left in her internship before she came back to the states. During this time we talked about the future, where she wanted to work, when we could see each other again, things we could do etc etc... The reason it was difficult is because I landed a job as a software developer in idaho that only pays 52yr. So plane tickets from Kentucky arent the cheapest. I also got us a hotel room and tickets to see one of our favorite bands tame impala. Well. When the day finally came where she returned to the states something happened. She did a complete 180 and told me she no longer wanted a relationship and wanted to be independent to travel the world and teach Marine biology. I was always supportive of this idea but the way she described it to me seemed that instead of a partner, I was more of an obstacle. And she eventually ended the relationship. I was hurt, really really bad.",
    "I got cheated on by my now ex-boyfriend of six years and I feel worthless First time poster here. On mobile. Ive known this guy since we were in middle school, we started talking during high school, and after a failed attempt at my life I dropped out of college moved back home and we ended up dating. This guy had been my rock for all those years. He experienced with me the pain of having my dad get a stroke, my only uncle on my dads side pass away, being diagnosed with ovarian cancer, having my dads mom pass away, my dad have a second stroke, and finding out my mom had breast cancer and going through chemo. Things werent always perfect. I nagged a lot on things he did because he tend to me reckless and not have a plan. Overall I just wanted things to be better for him. To be prepared and essentially have a backup plan. This year he started going through a rough phase at work, being in a call center and having upset customers he would take it to heart when they would tell him to kill himself. For a very long time I told him to find someone to talk to, to go look for a counselor. He never did and I saw him get worse and worse. I tried being the best support I could for him. It was only fair and obviously I did it because I loved him. On the November 7th he finally spoke to a counselor. I asked how it went and he said it went well. Then on November 9th he asked to speak to me once I arrived home from being out of town. He arrived at my house after work. He begins explaining to me that when he was talking to his counselor he was asked what made him happy and responded with photography. He mentioned that he never thought of us. Which is fair because it had been rocky. He said he didnt love me anymore. He finished what he said and waited for me to reply. I was in shock. I didnt realize just how bad it was. It was like a curve ball was thrown at me. I didnt know because he never opened up to me even when I asked.",
    "Ghosted by Son and His Mom Ive been dealing really well with depression for awhile. Mostly just some hard spikes up in depression where its a few hours of intense depression and anxiety. But this has got me in the numb, why bother zone, which I feel is the most dangerous because it can last for so long. My son late teens and I had a pretty good relationship as far as I could tell, and for being half a country apart. We chatted online almost every day, and sometimes game online. Its his preferred way of communicating. We had a great time together this summer. He stopped responding about 3 weeks ago. I texted him and he politely said the equivalent of, I need some space for about a week, just working something out. I respect that and I let him know that. I asked his mom if it was something I should worry about or if theres anything I can do to help. She responded that its teenager stuff and hes not in danger. Son lives with depression and anxiety too. So I give space. 2 weeks go by. I message him just to check in and let him know I love him. Nothing. Then a message about his upcoming psychologist appointment. I say that its scary to me that he needs to see a psychologist, but I dont know anything about whats going on. No response. I email his mom, we mostly talk Christmas gifts but no answers about how our son is doing. Its been over 3 weeks now. I emailed his mom again a couple days ago. No response. Im worried for him. She has left me uninformed about very important things about our son before. This is extremely unusual for him, especially for this time of year. Were usually chatting about Christmas stuff. I feel like throwing up. Im very worried for him. Maybe he is ok. Maybe this is just what happens. I understood the day could come when he goes off on his own and Im an occasional thought and memory. Thats what I could get for living so far away since he was a toddler. Whole other story why that happened that Im not going to get into.",
    "Gotten to a really weird place where I don't even want tv on in the background After a decade of depression, Ive finally gotten to a strange place. I cant distract myself with media anymore. I just sit in a room. Ive spent the better part of my life on a computer or my phone, but that isnt helping anymore. Ive lost interest in my shows, sites, creative outlets, its just all gone. I dont look forward to anything even a little and thats beyond anything Ive dealt with before. I always had media to keep me occupied. I dont even want junk food, and thats a very out of character thing I just dont know what to do with my time. Everything is too much. I shower once a week at most, I interact with people once a fortnight, I havent cooked in months, I feel like Im moving house every time I need to go outside because its such a big undertaking, I dont have a job and looking for work is an impossible task Therapists have told me they dont know what to do with me. I cant afford one now anyway. I was on medication for years and it didnt help. Ive been off meds for a year now and feel mentally much better without them. Im just really not sure what to do with myself",
    "I dont love/like my mother and idk if the relationship is worth salvaging. Another thing she been on methadone for like 13 years, thats not how methadone should work but fuck it im no doctor. 4 years later she makes a big deal about money and all this stuff and i go to find out that, first she never used my money to pay rent, it turned out from me talking to our landlord that she owed almost 6 months of backrent! I also found out that the boyfriend didnt contribute to any of the finances so at a young age she put her financial responsibility in my hands. We ended up getting evicted and I was pissed and didnt talk to her for 2 years then she got cancer. So i did what i felt was the right thing and was there for her regardless. She got better and now well this whole thing came from a argument the other day we had. I have major depression and i was trying to ask for help and she got mad at me cause i told her i cant talk to her about it. She asked why and i told her the truth that i dont wanna have a who had a sadder life competition. Because she has a habit of if i was to complain about my childhood instead of listening or sympathizing she would bring up things like oh i was molested my childhood wasnt that great. Yeah thats fucking terrible and all that but that doesnt excuse your decision for you children. Youre supposed to work to make things better for them. Which is the only valuable life lesson she taught me, because she never did it. Now im in a ok place Im in school full time work 2 jobs all so i can have a easier life, and she dont understand that Im busy even though i told her this. Honestly shes the reason for a lot of my depression. it sucks having to coddle a parent, i have no guidance i feel lost half the time and she will never understand that.",
    "What to say to someone who talks about killing themselves and having depression? TW mentioned suicide wish. So I am not friends with this person, but I have followed them on social media for a very long time 4 years and have met them one time in person, when we were close in vicinity they live in a different country. We also wrote sometimes via dms about this and that. About 20h ago they posted a checklist for signs to look out for, if you suspect someone is going to take their life and they made a check behind nearly all of them. In the caption they talked how they want to die, how they feel like a failure and absolutely worthless with what they archieved or not archieved in life so far. The only thing holding them back from killing themselves is their fear of pain. They say nothing that we could comment would make her feel better. Is there something I can say, should I send them a help hotline? They said they already called a hotline but hung up after a short moment in waiting line. Is there something impactful, that I can say to prevent them from killing themselves?",
    "Should I kill myself? I am the most uninteresting person and I feel like I am the only one who puts effort into any of my relationships. But when we broke up, they were there for me. Though I hated myself for opening up to them, showing the weak side of myself, showing my insecurity, and once again depending on others for emotional stability is so unhealthy and unattractive. I cried infront of them, I told them about how I suffered with suicidal thoughts, I told them about my past and what I went through and they listened to me. I am grateful for that but I never should of told them a thing. 2020 happened and I began isolating myself, I attempted suicide once at the start. I tried reaching out to Angela, I didnt want to tell any of them about my issues any more but I wanted to distract myself and have someone to chat to. No response, the lack of effort I put in my friends finally came to haunt me. Once I got over my ex in march 2020, no one wanted to talk to me anymore. We werent able to see eachother at school and I didnt build that relationship where we can just text. We werent able to hangout so the friendships sort of rotted. I thought I was hopeless, friendless, and losing more prospects for the future. I dont have connections to be successful. I have nothing. So I though why not end it. I took a bunch of pills but I just ended up blacking out and puking a bunch. I remember the feeling of blacking out but I could still hear the voice of people freaking out as I was fading. I lost vision and feeling but I could still hear. I thought I was dead. But no I wasnt, I started therapy regularly. I was so hopeless and didnt know how to make friends but I kept pushing through. I tried reaching out a few times and sometimes they said hi back. I ended up hanging out with Angela once restrictions lifted a bit in the summer. But after that we struggled to talk again. My other 2 friends ended up dating and stopped talking to most people becsuse of that.",
    "My friend just told me she wants to kill herself Hi everyone. My friend just told me shes been suicidal since last November. She has had fights with some friends and has distanced herself from the group. She then changed schools. She changed like a month ago. She says she made some friends. But today she wrote a message and told me shes shaking because she was crying. I asked her why and she made me prommise not to tell my friends. And she told me that shes been wanting to kill herself. I never dealed with this so I dont know what to do. I wont tell anyone about it. I adviced her to tell a professional. I would always be by her side and do my bestto help her, but I cant replace proffesionals in any ways. she told me shes going to a psychologist. I told her that I loved her shes really special to me and told her the reasons why. She says that she knows and Im one of the reasons shes not commiting suicide. She also doesnt want her friends and family to be sad after she kills herself, and her granpa. I dont know what to do. She cant kill herself. Shes got a life to live. Were only 14 I dont know what to do shes too young to die she cantbdie shes my friend please help me I dont know ehat to say to her I dont know what to do if she actually one dau decides to kill herself anf I could have stopped it by saying the right thing and I didnt I dont know how to do this",
    "I know this is disgusting but, I need advice on keeping up with basic hygiene and cleanliness Im sorry, I know this is gross but, my room is disgusting, clothes and trash all over the floor, overflowing trash, cups everywhere. Im a filthy person. I just throw my stuff around without even thinking it and by the time i notice it I feel too overwhelmed to clean. Another thing I struggle with is my dental hygiene. I keep forgetting to brush my teeth, and when I do remember I dread it and try to avoid it. I know its kinda childish but I hate the taste of toothpaste and struggle with focusing on it, even though it only takes two minutes. If anyone can give any advice on how to get these habits under control Id greatly appreciate it. Ive been struggling with both of these for all of my life. But I want to be able to have a clean room and good hygiene, and I just somehow cant will myself to do it.",
    "Self-Improvement help As I said this is not the first time this happens to me and would probably not be the last one if I dont force myself to change. Probably, right now I should focus on getting out of the postbreakup depression filling the void she left, new hobbies, activities... and move on but there is a lot in me Id like to improve, just to name a few  Manage amp control emotions better  as you can gather from all the previous  Be more confident My confidence is not the worst but I find it lacking most of the time  Have better human relationships As I mentioned I dont have too many friends. I usually have a hard time accepting new people into my life. Most of my human interactions feel fictitious, most I get lately are from work not real friendships. I can go entire weekends home alone without no one contacting me, thus, feeling lonely. I am mostly an introvert, I once saw a post of another fellow introvert that said the best days of his life where when an extrovert adopted him. Never a post has spoken so much to me. Social anxiety Not super bad in my case but I tend to get anxious in large groups, especially if I dont know anyone. I tend to feel uncomfortable and out of place. Be less clingy I have always been the one dumped and I always have a hard time accepting it, probably easy to understand bearing into consideration the previous points. I have not much of a clue where to start from, however. I believe Ive seen people recommend meditation but I never was too sure about it, maybe I should give it a go? Or selfhelp books? Courses? Seeing a psychologist or some other kind of therapy? My most sincere thanks to anyone that goes through this entire post, I wanted to keep it short but oh well.",
    "feeling very weak Im extremely passionate and hardcore about my career, but Im a carbon copy of my mother. Just like her, Im starting to develop and have problems dealing with depression. The city I go to college in is ugly and amplifies my depression ten fold. Im about to start my last semester, but my dad wants me to transfer to another college in the same area to get a bachelors in my field. I dont feel like I can handle the upcoming semester, let alone two more years of this. Never got suicidal thoughts until I started living there Milwaukee. People tell me to keep my chin up and just look at the bright side of things, but its impossible. Everything makes me so unhappy. I really really want to just skip out on the bachelors, but it would disappoint my parents and myself, admittedly. I dont know what to do to balance out all the despair. Things im already doingabout to start doing listed below, suggestions very welcome  exercising with ring fit about to, just got the game  playing switch games figured itd make me happier to finally buy a switch  spending a lot of time with my friends  painting and sculpting  drawing  roleplaying  cooking sometimes What are more things I can do?",

I also play softball, Im halfway decent but Im not good and it gets to a point where there are really good players on the team and I still end up sitting the bench, I even paid to be on the team and they didnt, I ended up paying to play this year but kind of have my heart set on quitting, its gotten to be toxic to me because I expect more out of myself than what happens, and just like the world everyone focuses on what you did wrong, not the many good things you have done. This quarantine has not helped me mentally and the constant ghosting, friends making plans without me, and softball. Thank you for listening.",

    "Things just keep getting worse On the background check it says I was sentenced to jail  I wasnt, but might even been for failure to pay the fines. There may be warrants out for my arrest for failure to pay the fines, I dont know. They still havent told me what additional information they need, but I dont really think it could be anything but that. I feel like my mistakes and being poor the past few years are going to prevent me from ever getting a job and making things better. Ive made mistakes, Ive paid for them, Ive learned from them. But I just havent been able to pay the fines. Even if they decide to give me the job, I have doubts theyll have me start next Monday since people will be off for Thanksgiving. So I wouldnt even start working til Dec. and wouldnt get a paycheck until Dec. 15. And this job is remote and I cant work from home once the power is cut off. I dont have anybody I can ask for any type of help. And Im really feeling pretty hopeless right now. Its literally taken me years to get this 1 job offer and its looking like it isnt going to happen. I just dont see how things can get better when it looks like things are definitely going to get worse. I could use the public WiFi somewhere like the library, but I dont know how I could do that while being on Zoom calls for most of the day. Even with a headset Id still be bothering others when Im talking. If youve got a better idea of what I could do for a few weeks, please let me know. I would LOVE to have a good job, get caught up on rent and utility bills, pay my fines and get on with having a life. Im just so frustrated and discouraged and depressed right now.",
    "Anyone here have reverse seasonal affective disorder - i.e.: summer depression? If so, could use some advice For the past two summers like clock work around the last week in July I have been hit with the above  I dont know what else it is other than reverse SAD. It usually starts with a general few months of feeling good and stable  meaning Im feeling normal, motivated and generally happy with some dips that Im used to for the most part. The past two summers I will have a really good dayweek whatever and then one morning Ill wake up and feel hungover or in a fog even though I havent done anything to bring this on like drinking, using substances. Also, Im quite active physically  so thats also strange. Whats even more frustrating are the physical symptoms my legs feel like noodles and I feel like I cannot wake up despite caffeine and Adderall. Two summers ago it hit me at a physical therapy appointment literally felt so incredibly off that I had to sit down for a minute. The PT said maybe it was menopause. Wanted to throttle him, lol. In a span of 24 hours I went from a normal mood to really off. It progressed to the point where I spent most of August in bed  only getting up to use the washroom and do basic things. I vividly recall literally crawling to clean the cat box my body felt so heavy. I actually felt paralyzed. I also recall having to return and item I borrowed from a friend and having to drive and being so out of it I wasnt sure I could. It felt as if I was wading through deep water or mud. Last summer I wasnt expecting it Bc I thought the summer before was just a fluke or hormones but I vividly recall the day before I was very productive did a lot around the house and generally felt up. The next day when I got out of bed, my legs were like noodles going down the stairs and I felt off. I was sitting drinking coffee when my husband looked at me and asked if I was ok. I thought I was just tired, but as the days progressed I got worse and worse. It took me months to recover Bc I couldnt find any type of add on medication that I could tolerate that helped.",
    "Help, my boyfriend is immensely suicidal, yet also a hard person to be around. Weve been dating for a while, and hes been depressed for most of it, unfortunately its become much worse recently and nothing seems to help. Hes also become just the most inconsiderate person to be around since the beginning of the relationship. Hes in a state where anything I say determines what hell do. If we were in a normal relationship wed just break up, no problem, but this has gotten so out of hand I dont know what to do. Help.

    "Hi, Im fighting my way out of my depression but it is hard. Need tips on how to motivate myself again. And am learning new things with online courses and reading books that help give me meaning like Aristotle, Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus and Neitzche which helps give me purpose. But i struggle to motivate myself to take the extra step to get myself together and move forward with my life, Looking at job websites and stuff makes anxiety just make me freeze, or do anything i can to distract myself. Though i am fighting my depressive state, i cant help but feel apathetic about the world and about myself in it. I struggle to motivate myself because i struggle to see the point to. I have no real motivation to improve myself learn to drivecodetravel more i only seem to take interesting but impractical courses that have no physical use like the ancient history of food. But i feel this is just a distraction to . Apathy just feels like a slow death, and i know that the decisions i make now will shape the person i become in the future. When i try to motivate myself to learn these kinds of things, it is for material reasons, which dont appeal to me. I dont have any real motivations or dreams anymore that require me to learn them On selfreflection, a lot of these feelings of apathy come from two key problems in my life 1. Lack of and seeming inability to maintain meaningful relationships that sustain meit can be days between which i get a text. It is my fault, but i seem incapable of change no matter how much i try. 2. Lack of purpose or community, there is little in this world that sustains me spiritually, and a lot of the world seems shallow and just full of suffering. I struggle to connect with a world that seems so indifferent. Sorry if any of this comes across as whiny or selfpitying, that is not my intention. I could just use some tips and pointers from fellow people going through this on how they motivate themselves to build better lives for themselves. As I hate feeling this consistent nothingness and want to fight to lead a life that i can be proud of. Thank you for reading through my diatribe.",
    "I don’t think it’s that bad I dont know if this is the best place to post this, but I do need help. Im sorry that its so long. Im also sorry for the bad English, it isnt my native language. Some background info I dont think Im super depressed, but my friends are convinced that I am. I made a plan to kill myself, but havent followed through yet. I have previously promised to tell my friends if I made new plans to kill myself, which I did. Now, they want me to get hospitalised so that I can get help, but the psych ward hasnt helped me before. The stuff I need help with I promised to get help yesterday, but I no longer believe I need much help. They wont let me rescind my promise, and I desperately dont want to break it. I am fairly certain Im not depressed. Even though Ive attempted suicide a couple of times, I have ended the attempts on my own before getting hurt. My question is should I listen to them and go to the psych ward, or am I justified in believing I can manage on my own? Thanks in advance.",

    "A bit of a strange case: Exercise has DESTROYED my mental health. Thoughts? Advice? I feel like Im a prisoner in Guantanamo Bay, and frankly, Im surprised that more people havent killed themselves in that godforsaken place. I know, it sounds insane, but this is how I feel. Its gotten to the point where recently, Ive had anxiety attacks and suicidal thoughts. I dont want to live like this, I cant live like this. How come there are so many people who do intense workouts and dont experience these afflictions? Exercise is supposed to improve ones life, and indeed, thats exactly why I started exercising, but its having the OPPOSITE effect on me right now.

    "Downward spiral after being dumped by someone who was never even my bf Im 31 F and have never had a boyfriend. I feel defective. After about a dozen dates or so I get dumped or guys start treating me like shit. I just got dumped by a really great guy. He said he wasnt ready for a relationship. Yet he messaged me first online, we texted almost daily for over a month, and went on real dates. I feel like this was the nice way of saying he just isnt that into me. He even met some of my friends. He told me I was the sweetest girl he ever dated. Then why would he never want to see me again? I dont have much experience considering most people my age are at a minimum living with their partner if not married with kids. I cant figure out why Im so undesirable. Its been like this ever since I was 16. I was always a secret. An embarrassment. I was doing so much better with my depression and now Im back at square one. Im randomly crying at work, I either feel intense pain or numb, I relive the act of being dumped and my stomach drops all over again, and Im seriously wondering if life is worth it if I never have someone love me. I take meds, go to therapy. But its not helping. Im overweight so I cant help but think some of the reason why my dating pool sucks is because Im ugly. I havent been eating really and when I do I purge. Ive lost almost 4lbs this week. I feel like something very real is missing in my life and after yet another rejection I dont have any hope left.

With patience and understanding, she was always there. Now, shes getting tired of it and she admitted it. Not sure if she still loves me the same, but one thing is for sure, shes tired of putting up with the episodes. im not so sure if i can put up with this the rest of my life. but she still remains, still providing what support she can spare. Were still okay, at least for now. I see the merit of hearing the call to leave me. I also know that shes gotta do whats best for her. But now what? What do i do? What can i do?

    "Partners psychiatrist invalidates his feelings and even told him to break up with me. My partner was diagnosed with depression as a teen and has been in treatment since. However he has been complaining how his psychiatrist doesnt really care for his feelingsno empathy doesnt let him talk etc. We have been seperated by the border closure since Feb 2020 and obviously this has been so hard on us both. We became stronger as a couple, but mentally exhausted ,appealing for an exemption and being apart from one another. He has been having a hard time these days, with loss of job and being apart, So when he was talking about this to the doctor, the suggestion had been to breakup with me. Clearly my partner is distressed and has not been having a positive experience with her. She also thinks Im with him for visa. I am from a culture where depression is a taboo topic so Im not well informed about it. I have started my research, yet confused and want the best for him. So, is it right for the doctor to do this? Is it normal? Because I feel like its unethical and unprofessional. Every time my partner comes out of it, hes tensed and more unhappy when it should be the opposite. I want to help my partner. I am scared and I dont want anything happening to him and want to make sure I do the best for him. He is the sweetest person and he has never given up, and have always been trying so hard. He deserves the best care possible. Please advice. Also please give me tips on how to support him when the days are bad. Thank you.",

    "Just found out the girl I’ve speaking to the last 7 years is talking to someone else. Need some advice please. Hi, Throw away account just cause I dont feel real comfortable posting this on my main account. Also excuse the formatting If its not correct, and the length. Im a 26 year old male whos had a thing for their best friend I know right for the last 7 years known her for 14 years and I only just found out tonight that the reason shes been ignoring me for the last week is because shes speaking to another male. Shes known Ive had the feelings for her for the last 7 years and she always tells me she doesnt feel the same way. Weve had so many arguments over some real stupid shit like her blocking me on social media when she goes out so I dont see any photos of her with guys because she knows I get real upset about it. Every time we have the conversation of my feelings I always ask her to be honest with me and tell me if shes talking to someone, because itll hurt me less coming from her rather than me finding out the hard way, and she always tells me no. The last time we had this conversation was 2 weeks ago. Fast forward to tonight, I had a mutual friend come over who I havent seen in around 2 years who asked me if I still have feelings for her. Me not wanting to show my emotions said I dont, so she then followed by saying oh my god can you believe shes talking to name. I was like wtf are you talking about? She then began to tell me how she has been talking to our mutual friends friend for the last 23 months. She then began to show me all these photos and messages that the mutual has shown her, so I got to see everything with my own eyes. I always had a feeling she was hiding something from me but I always got the answer no from her so I always ignored. Shes my best friend, shes literally the reason Im still alive. Ive been through hell and back with her, and I value her friendship so much that I can get through all the suffering and pain I have when shes around just so I can spend some time with her, but all she does when she comes over is sit on her phone for hours and just smiles at it.",
    "What does it take to get better? I guess this is just me bitching about life. I understand you have to put in the work for it to get better. But nobody says what that work entails. Sometimes I wish I had a step by step process of what to do to stop feeling this way. This way feeling like Im not good enough. Logically I know I have a lot going for me and for the first time in my life I feel somewhat content and excited for the future. But my self worth still depends on LOVE. I hate that. I really want to feel happiness inside myself. And I do have things i love about myself. Im a good writer, ambitious, resourceful, conventionally attractive I guess but I enjoy my soul more than my looks. Still, I cant help but think I am worthless and pathetic and that if I dont marry before the age of 25 no man will want me. I also spent a lot of time in theredpill which maybe contributes to this way of thinking. I have traditional values and hate that this generation is so into the hookup culture that perpetuates feeling used up as a way of empowerment. If it makes you happy then more power to you I wish I could have meaningless sex and feel some form of enjoyment. But when all men have ever wanted me for is my body it makes me question if theres any good ones left. Logically i know there must be, by how do I stop attracting the bad ones and more importantly love myself instead?",

I cant understand how someone can have 4 houses, take 12 cruises a year and fly around in private jets when everyone else is dying. How can we be this selfish as a species? Darwinism no longer controls us, its survival of the wealthy, which I know I will never be.",
    "I feel unwanted and unloved Im 19yr girl. Ive always had a rocky life. Ive had an eating disorder since I was in 6th grade and,Ive always thought that I was never enough. Then in 2017 I went through this long period of having severe health anxiety to the point where I would think my hand would stop working if I thought about it too muchIk its weird...lately its been my bf whos made me feel like I wanna die. He has basically been cheating on me this whole relationship.weve been together for a year and 6 months. Today he told me he almost had sex with some random woman he met on the street. Basically she asked him if he wanted to have sex and agreed then he changed his mind Before this he has only cheated on me with people online,but this really destroyed me.i basically have no self worth anymore.ive been emotionally wrecked by this.i feel like I have no reason to live. Hes my only support,if I leave him I will be alone.i just need some help rn . Ive felt depressed for many years now but I feel like nothing ever seems to get better.",
    "I literally can't do anything right now For the past few weeks Ive been feeling more and more depressed. Ive had it controlled well for years but things happening all at once has just brought me to tears at this point. I have a bf, hes amazing but one thing that I would say is wrong with him is he doesnt know how to support me when Im like this. Hell ask whats wrong, If theres something specific Ill tell him, but its been so many things its just everything. And he doesnt know how to respond to that. It just makes me feel incredibly lonely. I havent been able to get out of bed yet 1.30pm here and he just happily stayed on his computer and now hes gone out. I just want to feel better, go about my day but I cant. Theres nothing I want to do. Nobody I know I want to talk to. Im just laying here. How do I get out of this?",
    "Am I the Only One? Hi, Im somewhat new to the Reddit community but feel somewhat comfortable discussing heavy topics. So, please please dont be mean. I have dealt with depression and anxiety for a long time now but just recently got diagnosed and have been getting help for it. To keep it short, when I keep heavy thoughts bottled up inside for too long I explode. For me, I started cutting a year ago but havent done it in a few months but prefer to hit my face. Ive done this for a while but not to the point of leaving a wound. However, recently Ive noticed that I leave noticeable bruises on my face. I cant control the rage and feel awful afterwards but then i want to do it again. When it gets to a certain point, Im suicidal and tend to somewhat blackout when I hit myself. I hate thinking about this but it happened recently and now I have a bruise under my eye. Im reaching out to see if anyone else does this. Every time I do this, I wear a lot of makeup or stay home because Im ashamed and embarrassed that I did this to myself. I havent told anyone besides my boyfriend, counselor, and doctor so I dont know what others think about this. Only a few people have noticed a bruise on one occasion when I was in the darkest time and automatically thought my boyfriend did something. I felt terrible and I wanted to punish myself more. My boyfriend is one of the few reasons why Im still here. Any opinions and thoughts would be nice. I just feel so lost and confused. Thank you.",
    "A friend of mine is dealing with some major depression and she isn’t texting me back. I need some advice. I have read some articles on this and I know that she likely just does not have the energy or motivation to respond, but the thing is, I would really like to talk to her since her depression does not seem to be getting better despite therapy and medication. I really feel like I should do something to help but I cant seem too since she wont engage in conversation with me. Im not at all blaming her, I understand how she feels, I just wish I could somehow get through to her so that I can do my part as a friend to help and encourage her. Its just that I want to be there to support her before its too late She has talked often about suicidal thoughts. Im not able to visit her IRL either since we live in different countries. I just miss talking to my friend and I would really like to help her through these hard times. I need some advice on how to get through to hersupport her better.",
    "Does anyone know of a non-lethal poison that causes vomit and/or diarrhea and can be mixed with water? Instead ofbesides hurting myself, I could do some justice in the world. Since good things dont happen to good people, I think I can make bad things happen to bad people. Not intending to cause any permanent injuries, just a little of karma. Might change my mind later, but I want to consider some options. A little of mud butt wont kill anyone, right?",
    "Want go back to my life before all of this. Please help! How can I get over this obsessive fear of others opinions? It is ruining my life It is confusing, but I guess my fear isnt that I am a pedophile because Im not. I actually fear the possibility of me fearing that I am a pedophile... sorry if that makes no sense. I kind of deviated from the main point, but I think the root of all my fear, is from fear of judgment. I constantly worry like oh god, I had another groinal response. How will I ever explain this to my future partner? I even go as far as to play out scenarios in my head, where I try to detail my problems to people. I just find it hard to stop thinking about others opinions. I feel like if I were to describe my issues like I did above, so many people would think I am a horrible person. I dont want to be a bad person. But going through all this the intrusice thoughts, grounal response, etc. I feel like the scum of the earth. Like, even if it was due to anxiety and nothing more, who would ever get a feeling down there when ruminating about child sexual abuse?? I want to be done with this, and hopefully I will get better with the help of my new therapist. But this constant fear of what other people think is ruining me. I want to have lasting relationships, and feel like I deserve them. I want to find love, and have good friends. But I feel like I will never deserve it, even after I eventually get through this. If anyone has any advice or success in this department, please let me know. I know deep down that I am not technically a bad person, because bad people do bad things without worrying about being bad. But it is hard to accept that these intrusive thoughts paired with the groinal response does not make me a disgustingly vile person. I think I would be able to explain the intrusive thoughts to my friends and partner. But the groinal response??? Who would ever accept me and my past...",

I am shy and introverted by nature but since the start of the global pandemic things got worse. I dont know if it can help, but i have had a difficoult childood and i think i have some trauma left i recently discovered the meaning of a people pleaser and how it perfectly describes me. I started isolating myself from all my friends, i quitted from all socials, i started losing interests in everything and i dont even know what im doing with my life. I used to love a lot of things, now looking at a wall seems interesting as reading a good book, i loved having loong talks with my colleagues and my friends, now i feel like a burden for everybody so i prefer lonyless.

I feel like im loosing everything.i keep failing exams, i cant concentrate on anything, i feel always tired but not physically. I ruined all my relationships with my friends and i dont know how to mend my errors. As far as i know it may be depression or something else,but im no expert in the matter i dont even cope correctly with my emotions, i usually suppress them.

    "My (24) boyfriend (30) told me having a child is the only point of life and if he found out he was infertile, he would kill himself. Cross posted in rrelationshipadvice because theyre all telling me to break up with him and not offering advice for the helping him not want to kill himself part.... I dont know what to do. Ive been dating my boyfriend for just over a year we had been friends with benefits for 3 years before that, so weve known each other a LONG time and we discovered early on that he wanted children and I didnt. We decided to keep seeing each other but open the relationship since we knew it couldnt be long term and we both could look for other partners. He turned 30 this January and we broke up because he wanted to start looking for a partner to have children with but we got back together two weeks later because we honestly love each other a lot and love spending time with one another. Plus then quarantine happened, so I assumed we would be able to continue as is to keep having each other to comfort and love when its basically impossible to start dating new people... Recently when Im not spending the night with him at his place, hell get extremely drunk and sad and not tell me. He texted me this morning that he got drunk last night and called a girl he impregnated 4 years ago who then got an abortion. He said he had to come to terms with the fact that he couldve had a four year old child now. Today I called him and hes been drinking all morning as of noon and he was watching bojack horseman and crying. He says the only reason hes depressed is because he doesnt have a child and the only reason he drinks is because hes sad that he doesnt have a child. But he loves me and is sad because I have the ability to change my mind and decide to have a child but i wont. And so naturally i said, oh but you could decide to not have a child and be with me forever, why is the impetus only on me? Then he said having a child is the only reason to be alive. He wants to see me pregnant and watch our child go to school and comfort them if they got bullied etc.",
    "What do I say to him? What do I say to him? My 26F brother 23M attempted yesterday. Thankfully he was not successful. He called to say goodbye and tell me the he loved me. He did the same to some friends and left a note for my parents. This was a very serious attempt. He has had a lot of exceptional stressors lately in addition to the fact that he has been suffering from depression since 2018. He drove a car at 90mph into a telephone pole. Thankfully, he is getting help now and will be getting voluntary inpatient treatment until further necessary. Im going to see him on Monday. What do I say? What do I do? I dont want to make it all about me when I see him. Im angry, scared, and very sad about this. Im planning to get therapy for myself to cope with the anger, trust issues, and overwhelming sadness that comes with this event.

    "Any other depressed mental health professionals out there? Im wondering if theres anyone here who can relate... I am on my doctoral internship which, is my last step towards getting my doctorate in clinical psychology. I had to move 1000 miles to start my internship which is obviously stressful because Im away from everything familiar and my support system. And its stressful because Im stepping into new role working 40 hours a week as a professional, rather than being a student and working part time. And my anxiety has affected my work. And the more my supervisors have provided what was intended to be constructive criticism the more I have felt like a worthless piece of s. And the more Ive messed up, the worse their criticism has gotten. And now my supervisors want to meet with me next week. Pretty sure Im going to be put into some kind of remediation. Or fired. And I feel like such a worthless failure I dont think I can make it through this year. And I cant help but think that my life is over, and I should just be done with this. My 8 years of education in psychology and hundreds of hours of therapy have not helped me get away from the feeling that I am worthless as a human being. I know where it comes from, but that doesnt solve things. I cant use cognitive restructuring to think myself out of how I am feeling. I have tried and Ive tried and I dont know if I can do it anymore. Sometimes I think Im going to be OK, I think I can pull myself out of this. But wondering if theres anyone out there who can also understand what its like to understand themselves on an intellectual level but still feel completely unable to fix their selfdestructive behavior? Any therapists who can pay attention to their patients needs and then be unable to meet their own, or who wonder how they can help clients when their clients are more healthy than they are?",

    "Advice on How to Escape Living Situation I know this is a long shot, but thought it wouldnt hurt to put this out there and maybe get some helpful advice. At the beginning of this year I was working hard to set myself up to be independent to escape living with my family. Living with my family messes with my mental to the point I cant function properly daytoday. I really need to be on my own. Things were getting better, but my life basically turned upside down. To sum it up Ive been dealing with health issues the last year that have made it to where Im in bed most of the day, and worse of all at home with my family more than ever. Ive been working with doctors to help find a solution to my health issues, but tests have been unhelpful, and my next appointment to see a specialist isnt until January 2022. I cant begin to explain how close I am to ending it. I hope I can find some helpful advice, but there is literally no resource in the world where I can get the medicalmental help I need. I have no friendsfamily to go to, and there isnt much more I can take of this. I literally physically cant do anything to escape this other than suicide.

I turned to religion for answers, I have been blessed to receive answers, I know 100 that this is all going to blow over, and the sun will shine on me once more. But sadly, it did not take the pain away. The pain is very real and I was trying to numb it with WHATEVER helps. I did not write this to blame my ex. I have read and searched for answers to know that, this isnt her fault. I shouldnt blame her for making a call that I couldnt make. I couldve walked away when the signs came out, but I didnt. Yes, she caused the initial heartbreak, but I am 100 responsible for the actions I have taken upon myself, and how I treat myself postbreakup. It took months for me to realize this, but it doesnt make things easier. I am still looking for ways to keep moving on with my life and try to be the best version of myself. I see clearly now because the clouds that have clouded my judgment had disappeared. Its somewhat amazing to see how far I have gone, yet scared of whats going to come. I have seen so many things from this depressing perspective, and I am not satisfied with the person I am. No one really knows what drove her away. Nonetheless, I aspire to be a better person in many ways. I aspire to be better in terms of mental health, relationship with God, and my character. This crazy experience in my life has taught me to appreciate loved ones, parents in particular. Only when God takes away someone that I care about, I realize how lucky I am to have loving parents and supportive highschool friends that have kept in touch with me through this tough time.

He makes sure to mention every time I withdraw my own hard earned money from my account making me subconsciously feel wrong just for using my own money. Same thing with going out with my friends, he makes me feel wrong for wanting to have fun, instead he just cares about me working my youth away as a slave for someone else just for this fucking money that I hate so dearly. Its been like this for me basically forever, Ive constantly had elders over me telling me what I should do, what I shouldnt do, things I must seek out, thinks I cant touch with a 10 foot pole etc. and Im sick and fucking tired of it. At no point in my short life have I personally be able to make my own choices or decisions and now that thats been my life when it actually comes to me personally making decisions for myself I dont know how to. It feels like I need someone with me at all times to help me make decisions because Ive never had the opportunity for myself to make decisions, someone else always was more obligated to make decisions for me instead of myself and now Im a complete wreck in life because of it. I think this method of raising me plus child abuse is why I just feel so isolated in this reality now. But now I think all this loneliness in my life is finally starting to add up and take its toll on me. In school from elementary until I hit puberty at around 7th8th grade I was a goofy class clown fun person who had no problem making people laugh and brighten up the whole room. But when my hair started thinning around 9th grade I started to get significantly more and more shy and more depressed and withdrawn from other people out of fear of being judged for being weird or awkward eventually this fear caught up with me my junior and senior years of high school where every single person Id have ever interacted with would judge my appearance or my hair because of how poorly it looked. I felt like I resembled a corpse because of how dead inside I really started to become, and even became more and more obsessed with death and wanting to be dead.",

Honestly, sometimes I even start wondering if Im depressed or just sad. It does hit hard, but it doesnt stay as long as majorly depressed. Two weeks is long for me.

I have tried free online depression chat rooms and such but, really, I just need someone to tell me I matter. I dont know how this tends to work on Reddit but this is probably just going to be me venting. This year my depression has been so bad that my pessimism and slow bitterness and resentment with the world and everyone around me has scared me.

This has never been shown through my actions, but I can feel this pessimism and bitterness poisining me internally. I have lost faith in everything, and because of that I eventually stopped coming online on social media altogether for months, both to deal with myself but also because I didnt want to end up acting toxic.

I have been online and have had friends or mutuals online who have known me for years, but I have always felt i simply cannot fit with them as they share a bigger bond with eachother. Ive just always been a nice, familiar presence that they will interact with regularly. But I have always had experiences of feeling left and felt like I do not matter as much.

    "I need help, TW SuçI∂e Well Hello to all the people reading this. so Im going to have to be careful with the information I disclose, as my situation is precarious to say the least. So Ive made some mistakes, I hurt some people in ways that arent bad but I had to make it clear that I am not an angel, nor am I the devil. When I hurt those people, a lot of people, people who really dont like me but have nothing to do with this started finding ways to ruin my life. I was accused of leaking a 14 year olds nudes, raping someone, lying about my age, and sending my nudes to people who didnt want it the reality they asked. Some guy accused me on his story publicly and since he has a ton of followers and people on his side so people immediately took his side of the story, without ever taking a deeper look. Ive gotten my own nudes leaked to almost everyone in this city, outside the country, friends relatives family. The pics and vids were sent to my parents as evidence and then my cousins and extended family. A tiktok was posted with my nudes in it and in like 3 hours it had more than 80K views, and by the time it had got taken down it had reached 380K views, and was then shared privately between the hundreds of thousands of people who saved it. Everywhere. In addition, Ive gotten death threats, people trying to find where I live and where I go to school. Ive lost every single one of my friends, not one has remained. I feel so lost and confused. Some part of me feels like Im the bad guy and this is the consequence of my own actions, I mean I wasnt always 100 clear with my intentions. But then on the other hand theres people who are playing this just like a game. All they want to do is ruin me and since they have no direct evidence for their claims so instead they ruin my life.

Of course they would sometimes up the dose just to see, but it never had the same impact as the first few days did. Tried Ashawagandha amp Holy basil adaptogens amp felt relief of anxiety for a few days, then back to same old GAD self cuz i have faith in natural remedies Tried yoga amp exercise, but hard to keep up with when im too depressed amp anxious amp its freezing out to leave the house . id workout more in my house if the ceilings werent so low amp i had more privacy i hate being watched, yes even if someones in the other room doing their own thing amp not even looking at me Tried eating more healthy not saying i eat unhealthy, felt good for like a meal then nothing, but im such a picky eater its hard to always eat the right stuff Tried Positive affirmations, about 115 times it can give a little relief, but nothing that a deep breath couldnt do Tried deep breathing, helpful to slow down breathing when anxious but extremely hard to remember to do Tried amp still trying therapy, but ive had multiple therapists amp after a bit it just turns into a choreexhausting to continuously bring up like yep, today i get to bring up my depression again amp remind myself of all the bad stuff yet again. idk im feeling quite hopeless. and the most frustrating part is that since im literally thinking my way into something working, like why cant i just do it myself? or like why doesnt it stay? i really dont understand ..",
    "Had my 1st doctor appointment to address my anxiety/depression, it was......weird. Need some feedback, please. Are antidepressants and medications like this still a total crapshoot? Cant doctors to prior testing to figure out how a particular medication will affect an individual? It just feels odd...coming from a world Id previous known getting diagnosed and treated for migranes where everything was testing testing testing! MRI and Cat Scans and Blood tests and this and that!!! before being able to figure out something that works for migraines. But now with my mental health its just idk, well throw this against the wall and see if it sticks. Makes me incredibly uncomfortable. ampx200B 3. When taking my first steps to address my issues a few weeks ago and making this appointment with a psychiatrist, I had absolutely no idea what kind of doctor Im supposed to see, what is recommended, or who even diagnoses you with depression or anxiety. I dont want to selfdiagnose, it just doesnt feel right. After this appointment I still didnt feel like I was formally diagnosed, just given medication. So I chose this Psychiatrists office because they had decent reviews of any I could find. I made an appointment before I understood that the Psychiatrist is the one that mainly focuses on drugs and medication, NOT therapy. Does formal diagnosis happen? What kind of doctor does that? Or is that a totally false preconceived notion I have. What kind of doctor is it most common to see first? A psychologist, CBT, psychiatrist, therapist? I just dont know all the terminology. ampx200B The path Ive currently chosen Ive not taken my medication not started, cancelled appointments with this psychiatrist, and gotten an appointment for CBT with a therapist first, which feels like a safer path for me. As much as I want to address my issues NOW Im impatient, going straight to medication just didnt feel right... ampx200B I could go on a rant about just how difficult it has been for someone with no prior experience trying to deal with this new situation in American Healthcare, but I wont.",

I only realised it can be depression in the last few months because earlier I told myself that its nothing and its gonna pass.

    "I’m lonely and depressed So I was off on a youth volunteer program, located across the country. We would have been traveling to a second place, which didnt happen. I was in a house with 10 youth from around Canada, who started off as strangers. We were living together for 2 12 months before we were sent home, which was halfway through the programme. I met some of my best friends. We have plans in over a year to do a road trip across the country. But I wont see them until then, as we live so far apart from each other. I loved the time we all had together. There were ups and downs, but I got a lot from the experience. Im generally quite shy, so it was amazing to be surrounded by people, socializing 247. I definitely came out of my shell. We would stay up late, and all sleep in the same room. We would wake up, and have breakfast together. Anytime I felt like going out for a walk, I always had friends around to join me. We smoked weed many nights together, watched movies, and made food late at night. It was what I always felt like I was missing, not having any siblings who I had this relationship with. Anytime I was feeling a bit off, my friends were there to talk to me about it. Also, I was independent. I could do what I wanted and be who I wanted to be. I wasnt being told by my parents how to behave, or being judged by a group of friends from home who I act a certain way around. I came into the programme as myself, and only myself. I didnt have to act a certain way to fit in with a group of friends, or act a certain way at home to please my parents. Dont get me wrong, I love my parents. But Im at the time of my life 17M, btw where I want that freedom. I want to explore who I can be. We were supposed to travel other places, and fly to a different part of the country to spend the second half of the trip. Then we got quarantined. Then we were sent home.",
    "I feel like the human embodiment of a silver medal Im the backup plan in everything i do. Nobody has ever seen me as their first choice. Ive tried so hard over the years to better myself in countless ways, but the feeling never goes away. I wish I had a best friend, I wish I was in the first wave of invites for get togethers, I wish I could find a girlfriend who doesnt cheat on me when someone better is available, I wish my bosses wouldnt pass on giving me the promotion Ive worked so hard to earn. I wish I could prove to someone, anyone that Im worth it, but how can I when I dont even feel that way about myself?",
    "Depressed International Student; need help I start working on something and feel it is totally pointless. I start watching youtube or the office to feel a bit better and suddenly it is 6 pm. I think that its already evening, maybe I should go out, get some fresh air. I go out, pickup a friend and smoke a cigarette or two my friend doesnt smoke. While coming back, I feel the day is almost over and I am basically useless, nothing will change if I get high. I go and buy some marijuana edible legal, eat it and go back home. I act like I am working while staying high, so my parents wont know. Many times, I just lie that I have a meeting and shut off my door, lie down and masturbate like twice or thrice in a day. As I get high, I also overeat and buy a lot of junk food and chocolates. Then, I spent the rest of the night till 23 am doing all this and watching office or Youtube. I feel totally exhausted and go to sleep. Then, I wake up next day exhausted at 10 and the cycle goes on. I also feel pretty dumb as I have almost no progress on my thesis. My professor thinks that I am smart but I am not. I just slack and slack and come up with some excuse for not doing the work. I just make some dumb and vague presentations an hour before the meeting. From last two weeks, I havent even done that. I just make some excuse and try to portray myself as the victim. I have one more semester left for my thesis and I think I should just quit. But I cant because then how will I pay for my loan. I am also not getting any internships, how the fuck am I supposed to get a job. I thought maybe Ill start a PhD degree as I am not really getting anything else and Ill at least get some stipend regularly if I get the scholarship. My chances of getting the scholarship are highly dependent on my honours thesis and I seem to be doing a very bad job till now.

    "I don't have anything, no future and just.. yeah. I dont know where to start so I guess I give my life story. My father left me as a baby, and my mother lost custody at some point. Therefore, my grandparents had gain custody of me. For the most part, my early childhood was normal until around a certain age I was molested by an older female family member that had also extended to one of my female neighbour doing the same thing. At the time, I did not understand this or knew anything, but they as did. This didnt impact me at first, I was too young to understand, but as I got older I was lashing out a lot more, mainly to the female gender. At first, I didnt realize this, and Ive never told anyone what happened either. I felt ashamed, scared I get in trouble and no one would believe me. ampx200B As years went on, I grew to be more of an oddball person, an outcast among my peers. I did not get along with the female gender, and I didnt care until I hit puberty. Around this time, Im still super awkward and bully by everyone. I didnt have many friends, maybe 23 and this stayed until high school. Up until this point, never had a girlfriend and didnt know how to approach any girl for it. My selfconfidence is long shot with abandonment issues. Most of my family thinks Im gay and Im still bullied. ampx200B Additionally, to all of this, I have developed depression. As a teenager, I look around and see people hooking up but not this guy. At home, I had several relatives just killing my confidence, saying I was gay saying I would never amount to anything and so on. I also have , and my family stopped getting medication for it. So now, even at school, Im struggling, staying in one spot in subjects Im not a huge fan? Yeah, it was not great, and I ended up skipping a lot. To this day, I cant ever get any medication for it either, but I save that little later.",

I havent been home for a LONG time. I only recently came back home. I knew she was slightly depressed but now, observing the way she talks, behaves, her extreme bouts of anger or sorrow makes me think shes depressed or even has a borderline personality disorder.

    "Opening up Hiya! So Im a student at uni and I find it really hard to stay motivated to go to classdo anything most of the time. I hate that I feel that way, I was pretty depressed a few years back and now I feel like I might be relapsing in a way. The thing is though, my dads coming to see me in a few days, so hes going to be able to tell that I havent been that great. Usually when people come to visit me I try to hide all evidence of depression unwashed dishes, clothes everywhere, general messiness almost like an addict would hide their evidence. But now I dont even have the energy for that anymore. Im thinking of just admitting to my dad that Im not that well, but I know that would break both my parents heart. I just want them to be proud of me and I feel like right now Im not someone anyone could be proud of. I want to be able to function on my own and do great things but apparently Im not capable of that. Anyway my point is Should I be completely open with my parents about how Ive been feeling? Even though I know theyll be incredibly worried about me and maybe even disappointed? Should I start therapy again and never talk about depression with anyone else but a therapist? Because when I talk to friends or family about it I always feel like a burden and that Im hurting them. What do you guys think?",
    "am i depressed or just overthinking? im 15, and it all started 3 years ago, back then o used to live with my dad with my step mum and my half brothers and my mum as well, but my dad would tread me badly. he abused me physically, emotionally, and sexually. but i dont want to go deeper into those parts. everyday after school he would always get mad at me for not studying i mean i did get pretty wacky grades back then but still, how could i stay motivated if even my own father brings me down? he would hit me if i get the wrong answers and say bad stuff. i remember this one time when we had dinner, my step mum was there and we were all eating in silence, i could remember that day like it was yesterday. he asked me if i did my homework and i just didnt answer, he then started yelling at me and he told that i dont deserve anything good in this world. i didnt know what to do that time, i sat there crying in the dinner table while my step mum looked at me with pity. she couldnt do anything and thats alright, i understood why. after dinner i ran to my room and i started cutting that day. after a few months my mum, brother, and i went back to my mums home country, i thought everything would be fine by then but i was wrong, 2 years ago i had no friends. i was lonely as heck. i have nobody to talk to. nobody to vent out to. last year i got some friends, but they werent the friends i really wanted. they kind of treated me like shit. and my aunt always gets mad at me for no reason, she tells me to go back to my father and it triggers me every time. she doesnt know what he did, and maybe if she did, will she change? a few days ago i had a huge fight with her. i cried and told her how i felt with the way she was treating me. but she didnt care.",
    "I followed the plan, and everything sucks. So, I was a good kid, got good grades, went to uni, graduated with a good degree, met a good man, married, and had kids. I fell out of love with my chosen career, and so bounced from job to job before my husband and I decided I would stay at home with the kids. Since then, weve moved far away from our friends and family  for husbands work, and I do like living here  but I have lost almost all my friends, and since my parents died, no one in my family really talks to me any more. My kids were never much involved in any school activities, so I never made friends with other moms. Our neighbors never seem to leave their homes. When my youngest graduated, I decided I wanted to go back to work. My health threw me a roadblock or two, so I didnt really start looking until February. I reworked my CVresume, and began applying. Nothing. A few years ago, my husband started what might be called a midlife crisis. He wants to open our marriage, and while we tabled these discussions because of things were dealing with, including financial struggles, he has started bringing it up again. So, I basically dont have a family, have very few friends, my health isnt great, I dont have the money to fixreplacebuy things that are needed, cant get a call  let alone an interview  for a job, and my husband  who has been my rock up until now  is angry and resentful because I dont want to talk about opening our marriage right now. I followed the plan, and now I hate my life. Getting a job would help so much, but my degree is old and my experience is old, and no one wants me. I feel useless and awful. These are office jobs husband and I agreed other jobs would not work because of health issues mostly, lower pay secondly. I have no one to talk to  friends arent that close family dead or wont talk to me cant afford therapy  so I am venting here. If anyone read this far, thank you.",
    "I am falling off track of everything I am 28 , graduated 5 months back and havent found a job yet . I have been rejected after multiple final rounds . Now its come to the point where I dont believe things will work out . Not comparing but cant stop thoughts of being scared for myself , when I hear everyone in my batch has a job . I used to be a person who would wake up before sunrise , eat healthy , read books and learn new things . I was someone who would never skip a workout , eat only clean foods , meditate every day and take care of my skin. Now, I dont get out of my bed and dont even look forward to the next day , cos its the same thing on loop , pushing myself to apply for jobs with no belief in whatever I am doing . I miss my workouts and feel lazy to cook for myself , I will order food from a restaurant often which does not feel good after eating at all . I can not do anything other that eating and sleeping . I miss the old me , I used to be a very strong woman . People used to compliment me for my mental strength. I have been through a lot in the past and have overcome it but this time I am unable to get myself back . I dont know this me . Above all this , I live with a roommate who for some reason enjoys when I get rejected from an interview. I have seen that on his face . Even when he knows that I didnt get the job he would on purpose ask me again how did my interview go . Other than that he cares about nothing , and has a very weird vibe . He talks about me to his friends, I dont even know these people and when they come home , they literally know each and everything about me . And to add to this, I feel the need for someone to tell me that I am good enough but I dont get it . I seek that from my father but he is just worried that if I will find a job or not . He doesnt say that out loud but I can read that from our conversations , so I dont feel like speaking at home . I dont know whats so wrong with me that I can just lose myself like this . I want me back .",

    "Depression, Depersonalization, Emotional Abuse. HELP. Since about November 2019 Ive started to experience symptoms of depression but i just thought it was some sort of phase or something since Im just a teenager but its now Jan 2021 and those symptoms have constantly been in my brain like they have almost become apart of me. Plus Ive started to experience a few symptoms of depersonalization disorder but once again its only a few and usually I only feel the symptoms to this when Im doing stuff I know my parents would yell at me for. For example one time I smoked weed with some people and In the moment I knew I shouldnt do it and but I felt like telling myself no was just like watching a movie and trying to tell the actor not to do something but what ever you say you cant change the outcome. I didnt get caught but that whole time I felt like I was just on autopilot. Idk if either of my cases could even be diagnosed because I only have a few of the symptoms but these symptoms are persistent but not all that are required to actually have the disorder. I feel like these stem from emotional abuse but once again i feel like the abuse is not like super bad but its there. Like Im consistently told Im the cause of stress in my house and I get yelled at for the littlest things but then an hour later theyll give me a hug and forget it ever happened  this happens everyday. I have a sense of isolation from my family like I live with them but Im like an outsider that doesnt belong. Also I feel like Im forgetting how to be myself like Im usually considered the funny guy or that guy just always knows how to have fun thats but like recently Ive noticed A LOT more of my jokes are missing and me being excited or funny comes off as trying too hard. I dont really know what Im asking for just any advice? So this was saved as a draft about 3 days ago and reading it again makes me realize that my situation is actually a little bit more sever that I thought. I hesitate from posting things like this because part of me feels like Im just doing this for attention. I almost convinced myself to delete this but I mean theres no harm in seeing what people have to say I guess.",

    "How to stop feeling like I missed out? or something? I feel stupid but I just got a wave of depression watching a try not to sing video from the try not to channel, and High School Musical came on. Some backstory, I grew up in a dysfunctional family my brother was stillborn and my parents became so depressed.. we were loved but we never had routine or did any chores so our house was always VERY messy growing up, and gross and in 2008 we u.s. housing crisis hit us hard. I grew up pretty poor, always housed but it was a messy house and we were not great in ways of food or new clothes or entertainment. Thats where hhighschool musical comes in. I did not have cable TV or a DVD player, just a vhs and a couple tapes. Everything something like video gaming nights with the boys memes or this instance of people trying not to sing a song I dont know, I feel like I missed out on so much that everyone else got to experience because they had more money. Or, parents that were better at organizing their money. I dont know how to let go of these feelings for such fuckin mundane shit like not everyone had an Xbox growing up, MOST people didnt, but it feels like everyone around me did. Im just sad idk. I dont want to be sad. The house is still messy and I still feel like Im missing things and cant get them back.",
    "What should I try next? I have severe depression and anxiety. I am currently in a particularly bad episode. It is truly hellish and I can do very little. Between episodes I can be fairly high functioning, but I am finding that I am dilapidating more and more each year. Work and relationships are becoming increasingly impossible even during the good phases. I have tried psychotherapy ongoing still, CBT, DBT, citalopram, venlafaxine still in withdrawal, psilocybin therapy produced traumatising hell trips, diazepam, lorazepam, propranolol, zopiclone, exercise 5x per week, sleep, SAD lamps, meditation, good nutrition, prayer, selfharm, changing jobs, going back to education, selfhelp books, sauna, icebaths, living alone, living with friends, living with parents, float tanks, supplements and some other stuff. I have an ok job and live alone in an ok studio. Friends and family are generally supportive, although I have a poor, disconnected, awkward relationship with parents. No matter what, the good phases never feel that good and the horrifying, suicidal phases always keep returning. I think a lot of metacognition contributes a lot fear of what others are thinking about me especially partner and work colleagues, overthinking everything, regret and frustration about all these diseases are doing to me. If anyone has any ideas on what helps or maybe works for them, Id be interestedgrateful. I havent gone into a full description of my symptoms as dont want this to drag on too long, but am happy to answer any specific questions. Peace.",
    "No one to vent to Is it normal to feel like you have no one to vent to? I dont have friends but I vent to one of my parents occasionally or occasionally a sibling. But sometimes I just feel worse afterwards like they dont really understand or they make the conversation about them and what they would do. I guess I could try therapy again but my past therapists would try to lighten the mood. And I felt like I was going to therapy just because I feel lonely but it seems like therapists need you to have goals and I dont know my goals. I feel like my emotions are too much for people. Even the occasional time I share my upset I feel guilty for getting upset at the person and like I should be less sensitive.",
    "I really need some advice to fix my life.. My social skills were and still are very poor so talking to people thru social media made it easier for me to communicate with others and make some friends so thats what i did and because of that i found some amazing people that i had lots of fun with and kept me distracted from my real life problems. Some of them were momentary but some i still talk to even till this day. My whole life i had to endure family drama from both sides of the family and i had to solve every single problem i had by myself cause i did not want to bring up more problems to my family so i had to mature pretty early on in my life. Fast forward to now i have lost 2 school years because of absences i dont have any REAL friends that i can count on and no one to talk to i spend my whole day in my room with nothing to do, i dont even sit on my computer anymore i just lie on my bed sleeping or thinking,crying. I am working on losing my weight and thankfully that goes pretty well but i still feel like shit and i find no motivation to keep trying or even living. I am very self conscious about my weight and i hate the way i look regardless of the weight, oftentimes i hate myself and i am disgusteddisappointed with what Ive become.. every day that passes these feelings get stronger and stronger i dont know what to do. Now that you know a little bit about me i want to ask for advice because i have no idea what to do or where to start on fixing things.. I feel like i lost interest in everything and i feel like I dont want to live anymore..i feel alone, lost and that no one likesloves me for who i am and those who do do it out of pity or just do it because i am a family member, i dont have anyone close to me that i can talk to because the only close real friend i had started avoiding me and i dont really blame him for that. I am ready to make a change because i want strength to be able to support the people i love and if i dont make a change i fear that even more negative thoughts will get in my head like self harm or worse.",
    "College student wondering if checking myself in to a hospital would be the best option— any advice? What was it like/how much did it cost financially? Hi everyone, hoping I can get some advice on what to do in the next couple days. Ive been seriously thinking of killing myself for about fourfive months definitely had suicidal thoughts before that for many many years, but I didnt start thinking it though or planning anything out until now. Im starting to finally feel like Im reaching the end, lol. I genuinely believe that I do not have the capacity to harm myself in any way, significantly or even slightly. So I kind of feel like Id be lying when I tell them I have intent thats more than just thoughts, although I do have many plans Im hoping I can go through with when Ive finally reached my limit so Im afraid they wont admit me anyways. Im trying to weigh the proscons of trying to get myself admitted and so far Ive only been able to come up with cons My worriesconcerns  I have no idea how much a stay or checking myself in would cost. I believe that this worrying would leave me off a lot worse than I am now. Id also be worrying about what my friendsfamily are thinking while Im gone and how Im just causing them unnecessary stress itd be a shock for them as they dont know any of this  Id also be worrying about missing my classesassignmentsa midterm and how I would catch up afterward  I feel like Id be generally miserable for however long Im there  I think it might make me miserable enough to actually commit suicide after I leave, although I feel like I wouldnt be able to effectively kill myself and then would have to go through the whole process of hospitalization over again. I just dont see that many pros in checking myself in, but I dont really know what else to do. Could anyone whos gone through the process give some guidance? Thank you.",
    "Effects of anti depressants So I just started anti depressants this last week and I wanted some input from people that are also on them. I dont know if I feel okay or if Im numbing down. And I dont know if that numbing is a part of the medication, or if I should ask for it to change? I dont get excited, but I dont get severely depressed anymore, and my anxiety is just a series of belly aches now. Do I have to trade betting emotionally free for stability?

I work a rotating roster and my body clock is everywhere, so I dont really have a routine which makes taking my meds at the correct time very difficult. Sometimes Ill have a fleeting moment that Ive forgotten to take them, but my brain quickly dismisses it as if its not important. I dont really know how to explain it. Deep down I know how important it is that I take them, but something stops me from caring. Thus starting the cycle of being chemically imbalanced and feeling unworthy of being mentally well. I essentially need to ingrain it into a routine somehow so I just dont think about it and just take them. Long story short, Im just seeking some tips with building a healthy routine so I can make this work.

    "When is it enough? F26 I am a person having my own struggles with depression and anxiety and lately panic attacks. After having read so many stuff online about all these things trying to understand them and unscrew myself, i still feel like im standing at a dead end. Im in the peak years of my life, i should be working on myself. I should be living the life, making friends, having good days and nights. Thats the reason i moved to another country in the end, to make a better life for myself, not drown in self pitty and sorrow. But the lack of motivation and fear of repeating mistakes from the past is paralyzing and thinking leaves me with barely enough energy to get out of bed and drag myself to work. How does this happen, it was never this severe. Thinking about seeking professional help makes me even more anxious because of the language barriere. I cant concentrate at work or even try to be friendly with my coworkers and i know how it looks, i made almost zero friends in a year since im here and i dont like myself as a person or my actions. I am acting completely irrational and i feel like theres no one to talk to. How do you break this toxic circle?",
    "I dont know what to do anymore Hey, Im feeling really bad for a pretty long time, I think it all started about 2 and 12 years ago. Back then it wasnt as dramatic as now, I think of suicide for half a year straight. I dont go to a therapist because I gotta take my parents with me and theyre a big part of my situation. I just feel so worthless and that no one likes me. Most of my classmates have lost their virginity or at least kissed a girl and im almost 16 and never had anything like this. I have basically no friends and the person I always talke with is annoyed by me, and thats not something my anxiety tells me. As I said earlier my parents are a big part of my mental state, they often beat me in the past which pretty much fucked me up and now Im like this cant make friends, antisocial and depressed. And now I really dont know what to do anymore, theres really no one I wanna life for but im too much of a pussy to kill myself so Im here, not willing to do anything but still here. I think I just need some lifting words that motivate me to be brave and keep on going. Sorry for my poor English, Im from germany so its not my mother tongue.",
    "Almost 25 and I want to give up, what to do?? long story short, I feel like I wasnt raised with a chance to successful in life. I grew up being very neglected, experienced all forms of abuse, and ended up leaving home at 16. I have struggled to finish school and have never managed to complete anything after highschool. I still struggle with PTSD and mental health issues. Ive managed to get sober almost 1 year and half sober however lost almost all my friends cause I dont want to go out to bars or clubs anymore, so it kinda alienates me from my peers. Ive been trying to make new friends but its kind of hard especially with covid. Im a bit over halfway through a degree. I am uncertain if I even want to do it though.. I want to give up. I feel jealous of a lot of people my age who are doing so much better than me in life but I also notice a lot of these people have supportive family emotionally and financially so I think it is unreasonable I compare myself to people who have not faced the same challenges. I know I need to accept that this is where I am in life, but it so hard to stop hating myself so deeply. I feel so ashamed for achieving nothing in life and just being a broken mess at 25. I want to end it all but I know part of me also has some hope that it could be better. But I just cant handle the shame.",
    "How do you get past feelings of guilt? Hi everyone, Ive been recently wondering what to do to get past feelings of guilt over past mistakes and wrongdoings. I know that I hurt some close friends quite badly when I was severely depressed. Im not using it as an excuse for my behaviour, as I still said the terrible things and was unkind to them. Now, Ive looked at those mistakes, spoken to people and have been working to make myself a better person and hopefully a better friend to other people in the future. Given all of this, how can I get over the feelings of guilt over what was said? I know its not healthy to hold onto such feelings but at the same time, Im not sure how to stop thinking about those actions and feeling bad. Ive read somewhere that as we grow, learn and improve from our mistakes and to forgive ourselves, but I am not sure what techniques to try in order to do this. Thank you for reading",

Its like I just think I might as well destroy myself, because I simply can. I know its bad to hurt me and if people see scars Ill be in even more trouble. So why dont I care?

    "I have no one else to talk to Well, here goes... Im 30 years old and work as a systems administrator for a tech company. I work long hours 1013 a day, specifically, and I dont have much to show for it. Not without showing appreciation for what I have I can pay my rent for the tiny, but cozy apartment we live in, the lights are on and theres food on the table, but its so, so very hard to maintain that. Im not complaining or blaming anyone, but Im the only person in my house that has the ability to work. But after the last couple years, even Im starting to struggle. I have borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder with psychosomatic symptoms. I willingly starve myself when I feel fat and ugly. Im on five different types of medication, all of which cost nearly 100 for me to get. My partner is also dependent on medication. Were both ill, but their situation is a bit tougher than my own. We cant afford to see the doctor often, no matter how hard i work. I make decent pay, but because of our crippling debt and the growing housing crisis, I have to work 5060hrs a week just do we have enough money left to get groceries. I feel like a failure. I come from a wealthy family that has all but abandoned me. I have my mother still, who is as supportive as she can be, but even she struggles to help me when Im at my worst. Up until recently, I used to allow myself to succumb to my feelings and share them often. But all that did was cause those I spoke to to worry about me. Theyre understandably frustrated because simply talking doesnt always help me. Theres so much stress and anxiety in my mind that Im constantly in pain and telling my loved ones that either scares them or leaves them speechless. My partner told me they feel helpless when they see me this way, cried while saying that too. My mom told me the same. So... I decided to wear a false smile and tell them Im okay so I dont make them feel that way anymore. Its not fair to spread my pain to others. Their problems are so much bigger than mine.",

My selfconfidence and selfesteem have been depleted. I believe in God, I am Christan, but I dont have a home church because I dont have money for the buses. Its hard for me to go to medical appointments because I am just tired of the frequency, and if there is bad news, its only me and my shoulders. I dont have anyone to share the burden with. I have a giant hole inside of me, and I cant fix it. This past week or so, I have had this sense of feeling lost, and I have been sleeping almost all day and up most of the night. I am homeless, jobless, and I am also semidisabled. I use a fourwheel walker to help me get around long distances and a cane around the apartment. I have been staying with friends since I lost everything in a fire in February 2016. Because of my weight and health issues, homeless shelters wont take me because I am a highrisk liability. I sleep on the living room floor at my friends apartment, and their adult boys love to be up all night and play video games, so I dont get the best sleep. Eye masks and earplugs dont help me. I cant sleep in a chair that I have because I toss and turn. They dont give me the respect that I need so I can sleep and do stuff like hold down a job. I have lost several jobs because of my unstable living situation. I have no savings, no family to ask for help or stay with.

    "I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts for as long as I can remember and it's only getting harder to reason against harming myself. I never had a catalyst or anything for my depression or suicidal ideations. Its just been present for a very long time. Ive gone through prescribed regimens of medication, seen counselors, stayed active and healthy, made friends very easily, and just overall tried to keep myself out there and try or experience new things to see if I could find that calling in life for myself over my life. Things have generally gone very well for me in life other than the numerous times I let my suicidal thoughts get the best of me and I either let shit fall apart or an attempt on my own life puts me down a notch. This has been something thats just always been present and feels very dominating as a part of who I am. It used to scare me and I used to want to feel better than this, but I just feel completely indifferent and empty to it and everything else in life now. I dont have the energy to pretend Im a normal person or talk to people, I dont experience any emotions, all of my old hobbies and such feel like a chore, and I cant envision wanting anything in the future. This depersonalization side of my suicidal ideations has been going on for a couple years now and more than ever I just cant find any reason or desire to stay alive. Ive been miserable for as long as I can remember and I know its not right, but, at this point I dont know any other mindset other then feeling this way. I know how to be a decent human being, I do good at work and such, Ive developed very close relationships in platonic and romantic senses before, but nothing makes it feel worth the effort at all.

    "Severe seasonal affective disorder I 28M live in Canada and Ive had SAD since ive ever known. Was originally born in a very warm country and migrated here when I was 6. In the summers, I feel so fucking amazing. Any obstacle thrown at me I have no issue combating and honestly fear no issue. My eyes are lit up awake every waking hour, I sleep well and even if i get 5 hours of sleep. Its fine and I keep pushing forward. However in winter, its the exact opposite. I feel like crying when a small problem occurs at work, my brain feels frozen and i cant even concentrate on a show even if Ive slept a full 8 hours. Sometimes i feel like I cant breathe. I do take 2000 iu of vitamin D as recommended by my doc but doesnt seem to help. But, if there is a bright sunny day like today, I feel great again. Because of this, it feels like I continously move forward in summer and my relationships with people are great. However i take steps back every winter so my relationships and friendships always take a hit. Also because of this its hard for me to advance in my career as well as I have a hard time remembering anything or staying focused in the winter. My SAD gets so bad that thoughts of suicide enters my mind in the winter. How do I deal with this? Ive even tried microdosing shrooms for work but doesnt help.

    "Is my \"popular\" intensive trauma program abusive/unfit/re-traumatizing for me? Im not interested in picking apart my trauma or suppressing what is showing up  I want to be able to meet my needs fully. Things Ive tried  Medication, therapy, meditation, healthy food, exercise, self care, and trauma informed movement. Ive found that mind body integration through somatic work  low dose medication is an amazing combo. Talk therapy has felt highly distressing lately maybe because my providers are not actually trauma informed even though Ive been engaged with different types of talk therapy for the last 8 years and had success. I feel hurt by my intensive program  I started an outpatient intensive partial program in addition to monthly check ins with my pcp  psychiatrist and I think its doing more harm than good. This is where I need your thoughts. 1 The intake staff raised their voice at me but I hoped its just the cruel gatekeepers and that the actual staff will be kind because its supposed to be trauma informed. 2 I got thrown into a 6 hour day when they told me it will only be a quick 20 minute intake. It instead turned into 6 hours of invasive questioning, classes, and therapy  during which I was required to be present and not eat. 2.1 There was no personal check in or regard for the fact that I was highly disregulated because I wasnt allowed to move or eat when hungry. This resulted in a 5 hour panic attack after the day ended, nightmares, and inability to sleep. I struggled with severe body aches for 2 days after because of how distressed I was. 3 Part of the program day was meeting with a psychiatrist that immediately fixated on racially targeted questions  where are you actually from why are you here whats your visa status even though I never brought that up and she assumed Im foreign because Im not white. This meeting lasted 13 minutes after which she told me my current medication is incorrect and I need to be on antipsychotics ? without ever asking me what I need. She interrupted me every time I tried to express what is currently going on. She barely looked at me and spent the whole time eating and looking at the computer. This was the ONLY personalized meeting I have had in this program  everything else was groups or front desk people doing questionnaires.",

I cannot tell if I do not care about anybody elses feelings other than my own, and I only do things to get something for myself. If Ive fucked up in a relationship or Ive hurt someone I loved, I apologise. Even if I am right, I apologise because my father taught me that is the way to do things in relationships with people.

I just got a promotion in my job and didnt even smile or think that it was a good thing. My boss even questioned me if I was happy or excited, to which I replied yes straightfaced. I am confident in my abilities in my job and it is not boring or mundane, but I place no value on it because jobs are something we must do in order to survive. Nothing excites me anymore. I have lost passion for everything. And I just wallow about in selfpity, trying not to become distraught through rage or unhappiness. Until recently I was calling up my parents almost every day enraged or crying with despair. I am sick of dragging everyone down with me because of my emotional outrage.

I have my father whos always a supporter of my mother and says that Im a human being with no emotion. I just feel so trapped. Some days I just sit by myself in the dark and just cry. Theyre a constant burden on my back and im not able to hang around people unless theyre literally given a background check and the parents meeting. I have no freedom. Im 18 and they still treat me like a kid. Whenever I bring it up, theyll say oh youll always be my daughter even when youre 40  its pointless. Idk what to do but all I know is that if I have to spend one more minute of quarantine with them im going to cry. I love them but this isnt it.",
    "This is a cry for help... My story is a little bit long so I apologize for that. Im a step away from suicide. Ive been dealing with depression for at least 19 months now, and everything sucks. Hi there. Im a 19 year old boy from Iran. First let me make it clear that Im an atheist and this is story isnt from a religious perspective. But Iran has a religious culture and government which has affected this story. I grew up lonely. My mother and father were never there for me. They just had a lot of expectations from me cause I was a smartass kid. But they never really cared about the pressure they put me through or my feelings. I started dating when I was 18. Yeah, a year ago. How did I start dating? It was my last year in high school and I was studying the shit out of myself to get accepted in a great university. Just 5 months before the big test, I was so sick from the pressure. I needed someone. I needed someone to love, someone to love me. my family sucks. So I started dating this girl who was the same age I was. One thing I need to explain to you guys is that relationships in Iran are really different from Europe or USA. They proceed a lot faster. I know its wrong. But its part of the modernreligious culture that you live in. For example you have to say I love you in the first month. Crazy, isnt it? Also most relationships in iran dont include sex. Cause most people in iran believe that hymen test is scientific. And doctors are making money of this myth. Fuck. So I started dating her and we dated for 2 months. I became extremely obsessed with her. I loved her so much. Please dont judge me for that. It was my first serious relationship and I completely fell in love. She told me the same. But after 2 months she told me that she cant get her ex out of her mind and broke up with me. Making me realize I was just a rebound. I spent the next 8 months completely depressed.",

Hi, so I started dating this boy that since the begining told me he has major depressive disorder, I dont know a lot about that but now Im making reasearch. Yesterday he told me that he is going to hospitalize himself and that he does this frequently to keep the disorder controled.

    "Is this a symptom of depression? Lets say that you want to do or change something in your life. A new hobby, learn a new skill etc. You know how to get started... but you never actually do it. You lack the energy and the motivation to start or keep going even though it is something you like and know it would improve your life. But you end up just fantasizing about it and not actually do it. If it is a symptom of depression, then I have been suffering from it without my knowledge for almost 5 years. I thought I was just lazy. There are so many things I want to do and learn that are in the realm of possibility, but I never do them. For the past 5 years Ive been on autopilot about this because I thought that was just how I am. But apparently its depression holding me back? There has been stuff this year that Ive suspected is the cause of why I feel sad all the time, but I never knew not doing what you want to do is a symptom too. If its true then I have missed a large part of my life to depression without knowing about it. Im 20 now so it started when I was 15.",
    "is it time to see a therapist? for years friends and family have told me to see a therapist and get an explanation for my behavior. i grew up in an abusive household where me and my siblings had to repress our emotions to keep the peace and avoid being gaslighted. now years later these emotions are coming out. i find myself having depressive episodes from late november to early march. this has been going on for 5 years now and they get worse. during that time i deal with mood swings, awful anxiety, memories of sexual abuse, and leaden paralysis. as well as paranoia. in the most recent episode i started seeing my face drop and my hands melt with the room going sideways. to be honest i am afraid to go to a therapist because i am afraid to face the truth of whats going on. is it really necessary?",
    "I want to go home I want to be with my family the way we were when we all lived under the same roof and to work in the garden and take walks through the desert with my brother, looking for elk and coyote tracks in the river basin. I want to hear the native languages I grew up hearing, but not understanding, in school again. I want to go back to the nights when we didnt have enough money to pay our electricity bill and my mom and dad would bring out the oil lamps and our domino set and wed play games and read by the lamplight and just enjoy each others company. I miss my dad coming home from work, bonetired and smelling like the propane he would fill train cars with for transport and the way hed give me a big hug and a snuggle before he went to bed. I miss the tiny town I went to school in and the way I believed in the church I went to wholeheartedly. I miss going to the Fourth of July Rodeo a few towns over. I miss my mom making us oatmeal pancakes and homemade buttermilk syrup on mornings wed go out to the juniper stands and cut wood for the winter. I go to sleep at night hoping that when I wake up, that is where I am. I wake up in the morning devastated that instead, Ive woken up in my apartment to an alarm clock and have to get ready for school and then work. Absolutely devastated. I dont know how to get over it. I am just existing. I cant find joy in anything. I feel like my life has no purpose and that Im just going through the motions. Im terrified of the day that one of my family members dies. Im scared that one day something will happen and we wont see each other again. That Ill come back to the farm and find that everything wed built is gone and that I will never find comfort. I am at a loss of what to do. I dont know what I want from this post, but I just needed to put these words down and get them off my chest. My parents would be distraught if they knew I was so sad. I just really dont know what to do. If youre still reading this, thank you.",

During this time, I have shut out my family and cut off all of my friends because I dont see the point in making meaningful connections.

Everyone I talk to I just cant connect with and I just feel like they dont like me or care about me or anything I have to do with. I dont do anything to make people hate me I just put it in my head and it begins to spread into the relationship with people. My co workers who say they are my friends say they care about me but when they see that Im in a depressed mood they dont do anything. I just feel like they are only in my life because of work. I have been thinking in my head every day that the world would be a better place if I werent in it people would just be happier to not have to deal with me. I even go to the point where I will make up reasons or find reasons to prove my point, even if Im taking to a wrong way. I do this in every situation and just keep telling myself people dont care about me and ride the proof to make it true. It makes me feel like The world would be better off with out me.",

My job is for a contact center and I work from home which was great at first but after 6 months on the job I feel like absolute trash. Im am being paid a decent wage but Im starting to wonder if its worth it. Every day I wake up dreading the following 8 hours and on my days off I feel like I can never truly rest. It doesnt help that our metrics are scrutinized daily and were written up when goals arent met. So every other week Im met with the threat of being terminated. Ive gotten to the point that Im using sick time time off just to not have to deal with it. I need to work but the job I have depletes my literal will to live.

I know I have to respect his wishes because ultimately were both prochoice, and I dont want him in pain anymore. I cant handle this reality though. Im in so much pain, and I dont have any support. I love him so much. He says that if I love him, Ill let him go... Please help me...please. Ive had 247 derealization for 4 years now. I also have BPD. I cannot process the my emotions when I think about him dying or when we are talking about it Im the one who asks to talk about it especially if he says something like I despise life or I just want to be done while hes frustrated  and he reluctantly does just a little bit. I go into a very confused state really, I feel a level of confusion most all of the time where my feelings are so overwhelming that I feel like I need to claw my brain out or just hang myself right there. I try not to show this in front of him, but I have had some horrible panic attacks after our conversations. I know this just stresses him out more, and I feel awful about it. I have a SEVERE death phobia. Its always on my mind, and it makes it extremely hard to function daytoday. I have constant intrusive thoughts about bad afterlife scenarios. I guess it may be partly OCD.

    "Morning disgust Hello there. Been diagnosed with severe depression two years ago. Now i got rid of medications, and there has been no problem for month or two. School started and I noticed how often i would get sick due to weather change. I also started to be more nervous in open spaces, even at home. But the worst thing that came back are the mornings... each day, in early hours, I would wake up, with sudden... disgust? I dont know how to explain it... basically the thought of getting up is terrifying. It feels like torture. Whenever i would think of something positive, my brain would deny it, or even worse, make my positive thoughts negative. Telling me i am all alone, that this is forever, and that I am a bad person for not doing anything about it. I know i am very sensitive person, But i havenť seen anyone so terrified by this. People would judge me and tell me that its my duty to go to school. They would start explaining it to me like I am some stupid outcast who thinks he can do whatever he wants. I know that i canť, but this issue is stopping me from doing so. Now that its back... I am terrified more than ever. It is easier to overcome it by getting up with no thought, but it is still hard and life consuming. I dont know what to do, have you ever experienced something like this?",

I exercise, eat relatively healthily, maintain several close relationships with friends and family, take medication and vitamins, go to therapy, try to keep busy but not burn out... And Im still stuck. Theres no situational issues or any residual trauma that makes me feel this way. Ive just always been depressed, which runs in my family. It makes me think of the quote, The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. I feel like Im just working WAY too hard to stay afloat, doing the same things every day and expecting that eventually Ill feel better. I dont want to give up. Im NOT going to give up. I just feel crazy, I feel like all of my energy is going towards keeping myself alive, and I dont have any room to just BREATHE. Ive had to leave work early or call in sick a few times in the last few weeks because I couldnt stop crying about nothing. Im so stressed by just doing my basic daily routine that I have kind of a meltdown every night when I get home from work. My days off are equally difficult.

Im not even sure if our insurance covers mental health visits. If it doesnt I cant afford it, I have no money of my own. According to my parents this sadness is punishment for my past sins, if I didnt do so many bad things I wouldnt be feeling this way now. 3 years ago I begged my parents to take me to a psychologist and my parents were shocked and said our daughter is not crazy and shut down the topic as quickly as they could. Like end of discussion. This lead to my attempted suicide and even that they covered up, said to the emergency doctors that what happened just happened by accident. And that was that",
    "He said he has suicidal thoughts My boyfriend of 7 years and I recently broke up. He had been acting distant and cold for almost a year now. At first I thought he may be cheating or he simply just doesnt love me anymore. We started couples counseling together and he began opening up more and more. Things were great for about 6 months. Suddenly he just shut down again. But this time he was mean to me. He would say and do hurtful things. I didnt understand what was happening. He finally said he wasnt feeling himself. That he was a disappointment to everyone. He admitted he would purposely say or do hurtful things to me. And that he didnt know why or how to stop. So he broke up w me and moved out. He said he loves me but that I dont deserve this. I now now he is struggling w depression. I believe it started about a year ago. But I didnt realize till a few months ago. I tried to help but he just keeps pushing me away. He finished moving his stuff out yesterday. I send him a text telling him how much I love him, what a great guy he is, that I forgive him. Most importantly explaining to him that all the hurtful things he said and did where not his fault. Thats the thing about depression. It makes you act outside your character. I really wanted him to understand that his not a bad person. Anyway, he wrote back saying his just not ok. That he has even been having suicidal thoughts. It hurt so much to know he was feeling this bad. He promised he was going to seek professional help. Which is great. I hope he really does. But idk what to do with this information? He is a quite person. And it scares me that his thinking this way. Is there anything I can do? Is there anything I should do? Maybe let one of his family members know? Im really worried and scared for him. Any advice is appreciated.",
    "How do you heal from the trauma of being unloved and emotionally neglected by your parents? Hello everyone, so Ive been depressed and lonely for a more or less long time. I fought a lot with loneliness especially, because its an issue I keep coming back to, even if I manage to tend to my various other issues well enough. Its the loneliness that dwells on me the most. I attempted to deal with my loneliness by trying to make friends and specifically by trying to find a romantic partner. I know what selflove is about and I know the premise behind it, which is to be able to be okay with not having anyone, because youre supposed to fill your life with your own love. But here is where I keep running into an issue No matter how much effort Id put into this, it would never be enough. There is no such thing as a void in my heart which everyone seems to talk about. I would say my heart feels pretty intact, actually. Im pretty fine with who I am. And Im told this is enough, because you cant possibly achieve a state where you genuinely love yourself, unless youre narcissistic. You can like yourself and enjoy your company, yes. And I do believe this is where Im at right now. And yet, Im still looking for someone else. An intimate companionship. A certain sense of belonging. And this is when it suddenly dawned on me Those are the things my parents could never give me. What do I do about this? How can one heal from this trauma?",

    "I don’t know why I’m seeking help here but please just read as much as you can... So Im 15 and for most of my life Ive been treated not badly but like Im really different as if there were something wrong with me pretty much only in school since kindergarten. Other than that Ive always been a happy kid with a great sense of humour but in the last few years since becoming a teen things have crashed down on me. I believe it was 2015 my close nan my mums side, ill get to why thats important later was diagnosed with dementia other nan lives on a farm outside my town where she barely sees anybody. In 2017 my cat that I had only had for about 5 years when he came to my doorstep seemingly only a few weeksmonths old suddenly died from chest cancer and I felt sad mainly because I didnt have much to do with him even though I loved him so much. Although I have had a few pet losses this hurt me for a few months tear down my face as Im writing this. The main reason it was so bad was how a normal day turned into hearing he was unable to move when my Aunty went home for a break, and that later turned into the vet saying he should be put down. On to the next crack in my life. Only a few weeks before I was born my dad died I still dont have it in me to sit with my mum and have that conversation on how it happened, and although I dont feel sad about not having him as Im used to it since birth, I have heard things about fatherless kids not having as good lives although I am being co raised by my Aunty who is pretty much a 2nd mother except she can be giving the fatherly tough love some times. There has also been drama including my other Aunty doing drugs and making our life harder I will say I dont think it is intentional but her stupid choices are messing us all up. Theres heaps more I can talk about like my addiction to games even when Im not enjoying them and the recent passing of artist xxxtentacion I know hes a very controversial person but I really enjoyed his music and just seeing his face and hearing his messages to his fans.",

I live alone and its very common for me to not reply to my friends and family, I dont think people would notice for days. I tried anti depressants for the first time, which was a big step for me. SSRI. I became more suicidal but they also knocked me out for about a week. I came off them and felt great for two days bc I had energy. Then felt the dark cloud coming back and tried to work with my psych to help myself not get drenched again, maybe just a light shower and get back up. But now Ive suffered a big emotional blow in one of my relationships  and Im just not equipped to handle such a thing right now. I can only talk to my psych and my friend about it.

    "How to stop crying all the time? Hi there, TLDR  I cry so much and not sure how to calm myself down enough to not cry. Im not always even sure why i am crying, it just starts running down my face. Im on month 7 of my current severe depressive episode. My bipolar causes me to have usually 6 months of depression every year, but this time it feels worse than in many years, and also its just getting worse despite having lasted quite a while for my usual pattern. Im considered treatment resistant with meds, though about to try out a 13th or 14th new medication. Im also struggling to access adequate support. I am crying every day recently, today being particularly bad. Ive had 4 or 5 bouts of crying since I got up about 5 hours ago. Nothing has actually happened today, so I dont know why. Im tired of this. Id love some ideas on how I can find some more calm. I do yoga in the evenings, but its a recent thing and I probably have to do it for a while to see improvements. On a positive note, I handed in all the medications I no longer take to the pharmacy for safe disposal yesterday. This makes me a lot safer in terms of suicide risk, and whilst it makes me quite anxious not to have it as an option in the back of my head, I know it was the right thing to do. I dont have any pills that could kill me in an overdose now.",

    "Im scared i will never have friends again I have had major depression and anxiety my entire life, but i stopped seeing a counselor years ago. In 2016 i had friends that i would hang out with that were also my coworkers. We drifted apart and its my fault. After getting a different job i had a lot of coworkers and some would ask to hangout with me, but i always refused. Something changed in me where i began to completely self isolate and push away anyone who tried to come close to me. Im an introvert, so i keep trying to convince myself that i dont want friends. But the truth is im scared of never having friends again. I realized that truly the only close friends i have in my life are my boyfriend that i live with, my mom, and my boss. Im grateful for them, but i feel self conscious because i dont have any other friends my age. I deleted all my social media because seeing my old friends hangout together hurts, as well as seeing posts of people with their friend groups. I waste too much time comparing myself to others. But now i feel 10 times more lonely without social media. How do i get out of this? I am too scared to reach out to old friends. Is it normal to have no friends? Have you gone through something similar? I would love to make online friends but i dont know how. I feel so alone, especially now that corona virus has taken away my job and i have no reason to go outside. I quit college recently too so its really hard for me to meet new people.",

I was in the choir club, swimming club, netball club and music band. I didnt particularly feel passionate about my extracurricular activities but I was interested enough to keep pursuing them. Same with my subjects, I did my best and tried to achieve good grades. I was good at art and languages. Once again, I was not passionate about them. In fact, I hated art because I felt the heavy work load sucked the fun out of the subject. Math and science were my weakest subjects. I tried so hard to excel at them but in the end I couldnt cope. I was emotionally drained, burned out and gave up. My final grade for these two wasnt so amazing, as expected. Nevertheless, I passed. When I left high school I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. I knew I was expected to go to college, but I had no idea what I wanted to study. My mom expected me to either become a doctor, accountant or lawyer but, as my math and science grades suggested, that was never gonna happen. In the end I decided to abandon the norm and follow my passion. My passion, being fashion design, was my worst nightmare in college. I regret not listening to my gut and leaving. But I was too caught up in not wanting to disappoint my parents and, I had no clue what I would have done had I left. So, I stayed. And there began the downward spiral. I spent the next two years of my degree, confused and depressed. I couldnt cope in my final year and at one point, tried to commit suicide no one knows about this incident. In the end I failed a module only to repeat and pass it the following year.",
    "Nightmares are making my life a living hell Ive been having dreams that feel like they last multiple days, despite me being asleep for only a few hours at a time. Its extremely disorienting to wake up from these. Sometimes its relatively normal stuff happening in the dream, but others its not. Its rare for me to sleep without having a dream that feels like at least two days pass, even if it was just a short nap in real time. The worst of these, which has repeated itself several times, involves me being trapped in a makeshift prison camp and used as a slave for manual labor. This particular dream spanned a little more than two weeks the first time I experienced it. I remember some of my fellow prisoners and trying to make friends with them, before being beaten and told not to speak to anyone. About I week in, I often start planning an escape attempt. Its worked twice, but when it fails, the prison guards kill me, and anyone else who tried to escape with me. On the two occasions where I did escape I was the only one to do so. I run home, to find the furniture rearranged and the walls in different places. I beg my roommate for help and hes confused, saying Ive been gone less than an hour. Im pursued by the prison guards, who for whatever reason are Russian and are experts at tracking people down without raising suspicion. Ive resorted to killing one of them in one of these dreams, and then it turned out he was just a normal person and not actually there to kidnap me. The normal police then arrested me and I went through an interrogation where the police concluded I was insane, then dropped me in an asylum. It legitimately feels like Im experiencing multiple days or weeks of time in these dreams. I dont know whats going on. My own mind is holding me hostage. Ive been dealing with depression for about three years now, and its gradually gotten worse over time, but the dreams are a relatively new addition to my daily torments and I dont know how to deal with them.",
    "Losing all hope Ive always struggled with depression, anxiety, alcohol abuse, and body image issues. Ive not had an easy go but always tried hard to better myself and get well. I got sober 1.5 years ago, am in therapy, regularly practice yoga and meditation, take antidepressants, get plenty of sleep, eat well, the whole fucking thing. I have a wonderful supportive husband whom I love, and with whom I had looked forward to building a life and having a family. And yet my depression still remains. In the last year, I have studied philosophy and spirituality and religion and cosmology and neuroscience and evolution and the more I learn the more I am convinced there is no benevolent god, the universe is random and absurd, and life is essentially meaningless. There may have been a creator entity, but its far removed from humanity. I recently watched True Detective and the main character says, I think human consciousness is a tragic misstep in evolution. We became too selfaware. Nature created an aspect of nature separate from itself. We are creatures that should not exist by natural law. We are things that labor under the illusion of having a self, this accretion of sensory experience and feelings, programmed with total assurance that we are each somebody, when in fact everybodys nobody. I agree with this statement entirely and had never heard anyone say it so succinctly. I have felt an urge to try and find some meaning in the world and in my life, that maybe I could climb out of the hole of depression someday, in many ways because of my husband. Until now. My husband is leaving me. He just started his dream job a few months ago, and hes suddenly decided he wants that more than me. That he wants to throw his whole life into work, and doesnt want to be married, or have a family, anymore. Note He is not leaving because I am depressed  he is leaving because he doesnt think he can be a good husband for me while he does this job, and this job is more important to him than I am. This pain...its just not bearable. It cuts to the heart in a way that is not describable.",
    "Lost motivation, want to quit... please help Fourthyear med student currently in the midst of clinicals. Just cant find the motivation to study or attend online tutorials or go for wards anymore. I feel so tired everyday, sometimes I wish I would just die in my sleep amp not wake up the next morning. Nowadays, whenever I try to study or listen to the online lectures, either my head feels like its in a haze amp nothing goes in, or I get palpitations, breathlessness amp feel like puking. amp in the wards, I feel totally dissociated from whats going on during rounds. Im so sick the endless cycle of trying to complete anki reviews amp revise my notes, in addition to having to cram in new information that the doctors in the wards quiz us on amp say we must know otherwise well fail the exams. Yet, whenever I try to take a break, I feel even more anxious amp guilty for slacking, amp cant enjoy any of the hobbies I used to like. My insomnia has been getting worse amp worse, amp the times that Im finally so tired that I crash, I dont wake up feeling refreshed in the morning. I seriously dk how my classmates manage to stay so enthusiastic about medicine amp how they have the stamina to constantly discuss studyrelated thingsmeet up for practice all the time. Also, Im so scared Ill turn into a monster lose my sense of humanity because it hasnt even been 2 years into clinicals yet amp already, I feel numb to patients stories like every other history I take has been reduced to symptom complex gt diagnosis gt investigations gt management plan. Its so disillusioning to see the doctors in the hospital so jaded amp overworked that over time, the focus just becomes discharging patients as fast as possible amp documenting changes on computers wheeled around the wards to protect against legal liability. Some of them even talk demeaninglymake snark comments about patients behind their backs, amp while I dont expect doctors to be saints, especially given the tough working conditions, it really makes me question my decision to join med school. Because I want to help people but this isnt the way I envisionwant myself to be when I graduate.",

    "How can I (28f) help my Mum (56f) who is depressed and considering suicide. I also offered to attend with her if she would like she took this offer as an insult that she needed supervision. Offering to help her write a resume and cover letter for job applications. Last night she called me in such a state that I drive to her home in the middle of the night from 5 hours away because I was sure she was going to harm herself and the local police station was unmanned for the weekend and I was advised that meant they couldnt complete a welfare check until Monday morning. I am terrified that she is making an active plan to end her life and that if she attempts it she will probably succeed the local ambulance response time is a joke and the nearest hospital is over an hour away. I have successfully helped her move through depressive episodes multiple times before but this is different.

Like not super terrible life ending decisions, but decisions that I know will make me miserable later, namely starting a habit of not eating and making a character that I really dont want to play because I didnt want to say no DnD is a big thing that I love in life and it also kinda tortures me because Im in a big group, and groups of people were actually a huge part of my trauma. My new character starts tomorrow and itll almost definitely make DnD as bad as school is, but I keep telling myself I deserve the pain Im going to feel and I really hope the pain I cause myself will push me to suicide real suicide not just chickening out at the last minute.

I dont want to commit suicide, I would have already if it was an option, but I dont know how to help myself tolerate this life.

    "I think I may have been struggling with mild depression and anxiety on and off for many years When I was a teenager from maybe 1415 years old onwards I struggled with poor selfesteem, low mood, lack of motivation, procrastination, guilt, insomnia and anxiety about school work, my health and social situations. Back then I did a lot of wallowing and was pretty woe is me. I didnt really have many hobbies or friends and spent a lot of time on the internet. Im 27 now and Ive worked hard to get better at coping with things but I still find myself falling into the same patterns though with a little less melodrama I like to think!. Last year I got CBT for health anxiety and I found that really helpful. This isnt the first time Id spoken to a doctor about my mental health but its the first time Id gotten treatment. What kind of surprised me though was one of the questionnaires I completed indicated I might have mild depression. This wasnt something we discussed and Im left wondering now does that mean its no big deal? I find my job pretty difficult because Im constantly battling feelings of inadequacy, guilt, anxiety, low motivation and procrastination. It feels like I must be the problem as I felt similarly about my previous jobs as well. So Im just hoping there might be something I can do to overcome this? Has anyone dealt with something similar? I know my problems arent that acute or severe but they are persistent and have a cumulatively really detrimental effect on my life.",
    "Too much to handle Hi. Im an 18 year old young woman, dealing with a schizophrenic mother. Im constantly trying to understand whats wrong with her and whats making her do despicable things to me, but I really cant take it, the things she did and does to me, and the way she got away with ruining my life, and the way she turned my grandfather against me and making me the bad guy. I doubt if she ever saw me as a daughter for once, and not just a mere trophy to boast about. She does not care a crap about my need for privacy, she peeks into my phone, my books, my laptop, and what not, every chance she gets. She constantly hurls curses at me even if something goes minutely wrong or her needs and wants arent satisfied the way she wanted them to be. She has literally told me in the past that she wished my life was ruined by someone, and I get raped by a vile person who would cheat me. Apart from that, I receive other constant curses like, you wont live a good life at all, your life will be terrible, youll burn in hell, your future will be terrible, and your husband will be a bad man okay, first of all, Im TERRIFIED of relationships, marriage, or anything that has to do with the romantic paradigm. Ive even talked to her about this but she cant help but obsess over me getting married, instead of me having a stable career. Whats worse? She has no logical reasoning behind this obsession, and tries to sell me to the same institution marriage that ruined her and continues to ruin many others! She yells at me for trivial things, and absolutely despises it when I even look at a person from the opposite sex  heck, she doesnt want me to even talk to MY OWN FATHER! She constantly feels entitled to just barge into my room to deliver twohour lectures about how she knows whats best for me, and how I should become the ideal daughter that she pictures in her head  a socially awkward, terrible at communicating, familyoriented yes woman, without any inclination towards her career and even if so, abysmally little interest must be exhibited.",

    "Let's be realistic I stand at the gateway between being stuck in my head and living in reality. You could imagine it like an arched doorway, about 12 feet tall. The door itself is made of rocks, placed almost like bars. The support frame is metal, cold, blue. On the inside, behind the door, its cold, its empty, its black. Filled with images if the past, things that I regret, pain, scars. There are two chains on the floor, not far from where I stand. Those chains were what I used to rattle to summon or conjure back the moments I feel I missed. Like opportunities that had passed me by, like love lost by the way side, like all the memories I just cant seem to let go, like all the people Ive lost along this road. But on the other side there is a light thats beaming bright. I can feel the warmth of the air brush my sides and I feel the urge to come running. Like its calling out my name, like I no longer need to be ashamed of who I am today, like everything Ive ever known has a chance to change. But my biggest struggle is in letting go. My biggest fear of losing control, yet I just need to find my way home, I dont want to be trapped here forever, inside the cold, growing abyss. Reminiscing all the opportunities I missed. I dont want to die here alone, yet Im so afraid to move forward, as I navigate this dark night of the soul. Sometimes its hard enough just to breathe, as I feel the light taking over me. All the damage hidden underneath brought to life, im forced to see and the well behind my eyes, it opens up, it opens wide. I can feel the tears stuck behind of all the pain Ive forced myself to hide. So I speak to you in riddles, could it be Im just a boy inside?

    "Is this sexual assault? So when I was five, a group of guys who were inside my school they all looked around 17 to me circled me and one guy asked if my name was Thomas, he said his name was also Thomas there was no way that they could have known my name, I had no friends and had never seen these guys before, and they honestly looked to old to go to my school well they then asked have you every touched yourself? I said no and then one of the guys shoved his hands down his pants and started to jack off, they told me to try it to and I did. The same guy who knew my name asked if he wanted him to do it for me. I said no. My memory gets a little blurry but I remember the guys moving a bit closer to me there. I dont know what happened next because my memory is completely gone. But I do remember that I told my parents small details of it and the next day at school about five or so adults came with me I cant remember if any of them were police and they got some students out of class and asked if any of them did it. they were all in the last year of that school, and none of them looked even half the age of the guys who did it so the people who did it were never caught. Shortly after this incident, I suffered from extreme suicidal ideation, and a many times I even told my parents I was going to kill myself. I have also suffered from separation anxiety all my life since. I am 16M now and only remembered this about a year ago. I am wondering if this is sexual assault. Or is it more, or less? Sorry for the poor English, I just got a new phone and am not used to typing on it.",
    "I need tips on productivity. Hi, so Im currently really going through it and am struggling to even eat and sleep, due to depression and anxiety plaguing me. At the beginning of the day, I have these big projects I want to undertake, but they feel too big, so I just end up procrastinating, doing only the bare minimum on all of them at the end of the day and thus getting pissed at myself, cause everything could have been finished already. Then I tell myself oh tomorrow, youll do better youll study twenty pages, youll write a chapter of your novel, youll make a proper meal. Yet I never do that, its just the same cycle. I think my brain is hacked in a way, cause I always sabotage myself. When I start to improve, I make sure Ill get worse again. Im just looking for productivity tips, cause this feels like hell.",
    "Don't know what to do... Im 20 years old...since two years the most time of my life I spend in my bedroom. 1 friend, 2 people of my family died. I got addicted to benzodiazepines and went to a rehabilitation hospital...but because of the lockdown nothing changed. My family live in another city and so many friends left me, I feel alone but with the time it feels good. Im also bisexual, I know that since Im 13 but never talked about that with anyone. Only to my therapist now the second lockdown ist here in germany, sitting here and accepting every day that its okay to die alone or stay my howl life alone.... I dont know....after one year staying in my thoughts and got also back to benzodiazepines now... Is this all? Is this the sense of my life? What will happen after death? I dont feel like anyone would care about me I tried to kill myself once My anxiety got so bad, Im always paranoid and hate myself because Im skinny. Thats why I would never let anyone touch me or things like sexual, because of my shame for my own body. Im going only outside when Im going to eat something or when its dark and not that much people there because I think there would always say things about me because I feel like shit. Even when I know they dont, its unnerving. Also after that long time here alone I dont wanna do anything anymore, I feel disconnected from the world, playing computer games and drinking wine. I hate this society, the people who life that normal life and I hate me, at some point i think likeWhy? Why I cant be normal like them... Every morning I wake up and think likeShit why Im still alive. But if I have a clear mind and Im not on drugs, I would never kill myself because of my mom.... It would ruin her life... So, have anyone experienced something like that? Sorry for my bad English, Im german",
    "Sertraline Just want to know im not crazy, i would definitely call myself a hypochondriac in the sense that when i feel a little illoff i think about it so much i feel like its affecting me worse than it really is. About an hour ago i took my first dose of sertraline and i feel like my heads already swimming and im feeling so tired. I highly doubt its because of the sertraline as i know they can take weeks to effect you, i just need someone to tell me this is all in my head, or that this really can happen. I just need some sanity",
    "To everyone who actually took time to read this, thank you for caring for me, a random stranger who probably doesn't deserve getting much help anyways. My mom just got high blood pressure today. And its my fucking fault. Since I dont live with my mom or my dad, I live with my married sister and her family. My parents visit me a few times a year, and recently, my mom was able to come over to Cali since the state she lived in was going to close due to Covid, and she wanted to take advantage of this time and spend more time with me. She comes over, goes into quarantine for 14 days, and everything peachy. Well, when my mom realized I was still hurting myself, she got really concerned, and made it her lifes mission to help me get out of this depression, which I had lied about and said Im fine. Dear Mom, I want to let you know that I really love and appreciate you, but for some reason, I just cant bring myself to tell you. Im sorry. Within the several days, my mom really tried to help me. But I was always bitchy towards her, saying I was fine, and I yelled at her. My mom, she cried sometimes, but she just didnt let me see her doing that. But I could always hear it. And being me, I couldnt swallow down the part of me that hated her, for leaving me and making me grow up faster than all my friends, who had happy families and happy parents, and had the love and emotional support they needed from their own. I was always the one that stuck out, who had to depend on friends instead of my guardians, because they always insisted they were right, and I was wrong. I could never bring myself to talk to the people who supposedly loved me because I always feel like theyre lying, that its their obligation to take care of me, and that they only view me as a waste of space and money and so much time. I got depression around the age of 11, but I just never bothered to get myself help until I was close to really cracking down from all the stress and anger Id hold in from all my encounters with my sister and her husband.",

My heads talking, dreaming and analyzing all the time, my memory and focus are down and just dont know what to do anymore. Some days all I can do is lay in bed and be anxious, other days Im full of energy and over enthusiasm with bad some nights rest as a result. Ive took my walks in nature, tried meditation for a long time, went to the spa and went to the gym. The gym helped me getting motivated, but later on gave me sleep, focus and fatigue problems. My heads full of memorys, hints and its all just like one big spiderweb. Meditation helped me with the sleep and focus problems, but I couldnt get to the core and discover what I really want. Im an epileptic and have PTSD and already have memory issues due to the epilepsy, so when Im at the psych I forget a lot of stuff andor forget to react to what the psych just said so I can complete the story.

Ive been bullied my whole life and been depressed since I was around 14. Ive always had this idea that things will get better in the future, It will be better next year, It will be better when Im 20, 25, 30... I just realized that it wont. I, like everyone else, am bound to work til the day I die, but on the top of that, I have to deal with mental illness. Is this a life worth living? I have zero friends, I have no supportive family. Most days I just stand there, staring at the walls, doing nothing. Im completely uninteresting as a person. Given my high school history, I will certainly not get into a good college. Im objectively ugly, as I have a very unsymmetrical face. I cant remember the last time I felt happy I have nobody left in my life. Whats out there for me?",

I havent done much schoolwork because it makes me even more stressed. Ive been sewing a lot because I dont know what else to do. I think of all the people scared right now, and it makes me more scared myself. I dont want to talk to anybody, because I dont know what to say. I feel like I want to cry, but I just cant.

    "Dae have a therapist that does this? Shes registered and a doctor so Im inclined to give her the benefit of the doubt, but honestly shes not been helpful at all. I want an outside perspective so that I can know if its on me or her. She talks just like a distracted friend instead of a therapist. 13 word responses. For example, I told her I was frustrated and felt lost about something, and she just said understand. Her solutions are things I could come up with on my own and basically boil down to her just saying no every time I bring up a harmful coping mechanism. I already know whats wrong with me and my life but not how to fix it! And she believes that I should talk the most in therapy but I dont feel heard when all she does is....listen? If that makes sense? I dunno.... Ive just been spiralling into a worse and worse place mentally and depending on her and getting this seems to be hurting more than helping. But then I have no idea what therapy is supposed to be like. Is it supposed to be really hard before it gets any better?",

My dad yells at me for a lot of things, and it just makes me hate myself for being so inferior, and not being good enough for him.

    "Texas ice storm - feeling guilty &amp; overwhelmed I live in Texas, and my community is in need of a lot of help. I was out of town for the worst of it, and was lucky enough to come home to all of utilities still on, no damage to the house, nothing. I even had a good amount of food in the pantry. I housed a few friends, and donated to some organizations, but still feels like Im not doing enough. Specifically Ive been invited to volunteer this weekend alongside other people from my industry. However, yesterday I wanted to get my house in order first, but ended up lying in bed, and eventually falling asleep for a few hours, because it all just seemed so overwhelming. Cue guilt for neither volunteering nor getting anything done around the house. Today Im in the same boat. I apologized and told the volunteer crew Id definitely be coming today, but again the house is still a mess, and I need to get it back in shape before I go back to working full time tomorrow. Funny thing is that I could totally do both, but my depressionanxiety tells me I just need to hide in bed all day instead. Frustrating, because four months ago I started taking medication been in therapy for longer and its been incredibly helpful, but it cant seem to take the edge off during this time of crisis....even though Ive hardly been affected personally. Im spiraling because I feel such a duty to help others, but I know I need to help myself first...and seems that I can do neither right now. Any helpadvicesupport would be appreciated!",

I used to love going to training but Im beginning to think whats the point. As well my mind is starting to become self destructive. So many times these last 2 weeks, I havent been able to look at myself in a mirror without saying something I hate about myself. Its brought me so close to the edge of hurting myself and Im beginning to lose it. I just want to have some I can trust and care about. But Im getting so paranoid that everyone I like and know just hates me. Its gotten to the stage where im talking to people I like, and Im over analyzing everything they say, thinking theyre just saying it out of pity for me. I just want someone, anyone to care about me.

    "I just realized I'm very depressed but I don't know why. My dandruff got much worse, and the suicidal thoughts came back every once in a while. Not sure if its got anything to do with this but I started driving really aggressively, well past the speed limit even after a ticket, something I didnt do when I got my license. Lastly, Ive always been very thin, as a male I still weighed around 120lbs ish. Now Im around 130, which I know is still nothing, and I dont think Im fat or anything like that, but Id never in my life gained weight, and suddenly I was 10 lbs heavier in a matter of a few months. All of this paragraph started around the same time. Today I was talking to a friend of mine over the phone and for some reason he just asked me are you depressed? Which left me thinking, yet my college classes distracted me for enough time. Today at dinner my mom finally lashed out over my lack of hygiene, its then that I realized I havent showered in months, nearly a year of sometimes washing my hair or just standing under the water every once in a while. I showered and it dawned on me that I, probably have depression. The mere realization made me cry more than Ive cried in years. I read all about seek help and tell your parents about it but Im kind of ashamed to admit it. Theyve given everything to provide for me and my sister, and Ive got all the ingredients for what Id assume is a normal and functioning life. It feels like I have no right to be feeling like this when theres people who have it much worse than me. Im posting it here because I need anonymous support.

    "Successful, but what is the point? Im not sure what to do, so Im writing here. I am nearly 50 years old, and a nurse in a management position currently pursuing a higher degree. Ive been with my husband 30 years and we have grown children. By all accounts, Im successful. Life isnt perfect but it could be  and has been  worse. Much worse. But every day I cant shake the feeling that I just dont want to live. Ive had depression probably since high school, and it worsened during different life events, but nothing severe is happening now. During the worst of times, I didnt feel this strongly about life just being completely meaningless and, really... what the hell is the point? Its exhausting. Im finding myself just stuck at work, unable to be as productive as I need to be. But Im doing well in my college courses  straight As. And actually, I started pursuing a higher degree to give myself something else in my life  something that would help me not feel so hopeless, but oh boy has it NOT worked. I have been to counseling before, and it helped during that situation, but I honestly dont see how it will help me now. Before I started the college courses, I had found myself looking up how to hang myself on a doorknob. I know the warning signs of suicide  Im a nurse! I scared myself. So I started college. Now Im two semesters in, and just the other day I was considering how I could kill myself and make it look like an accident so my family wouldnt have to live with my suicide. Yet earlier today, I was laughing so hard I couldnt even tell the story about something funny my dogs did last night. Its amazing to me that I can be this absolutely hopeless, yet still laugh like that. So anyone else feel like this? Did you get past it? And how?",
    "I need help…. Im really struggling today. My normal coping techniques getting outside, watching a favorite show, etc arent working. Weekends are always tough for me. But its now October and my late Moms birthday is in two weeks. I was her caregiver. She wouldve been 65. Qualifying for Medicare and we couldve gotten so much more help for her paraplegia. And since she was a teacher i.e. state worker she didnt qualify for disability or other help. Thanks for nothing for her 25 years of service huh? Regardless, its bothering me more as this is the year her life wouldve gotten easier and mine and shes not here to enjoy that. I wouldve been helping her with her new paperwork, enjoying the research, etc. Add on to that, I took a new job in April, and while good, its a big change. I then lost my dog which was Moms as well in June so Im now alone. Im single as my caregiving responsibilities didnt give me a lot of dating time or opportunity. Nothing much excites me anymore. My music has fallen to the wayside. I cant enjoy playing a video game. And trying to lose weight for health during all this is just added stress. Ive never been a quitter, pretty ambitious guy. Not anymore. It took a year to get past my Moms death. But now losing our dog is like losing her all over again. Add in pandemic stress on that and there you have it. Ive had some really dark times here as of late. Just need to talk and some nonjudgmental help.",

A good thing to mention right now is that my stress and other things I couldnt sleep, loss of my appetite, etc... had also stemmed from my home life, but that goes into a whole nother story. On Friday I found out something, that he had already gotten a new girlfriend we broke up on Monday btw with a girl who had a crush on him through, and before, we went out. I know it was stupid of me but I was upset, I was glad for him but I couldnt help feeling...betrayed?? ?very stupid of me I know In short he then told people why i broke up with him, and that is when i started to ignore him as it was private. I keep having these breakdowns and I feel that this story is when it really started to affect me, at this moment I have had 3 breakdowns in lessons and 1 at break, along with many at home. I just want to know if Im being stupid or if I actually have a problem, sorry about my bad writing skills, Im writing this as Im in a breakdown If you would like I will get into my home story, it is a big part of this story Thank you in advance",
    "Cutting Hello, Yesterday I cut myself, on my arm. Im wondering how it will heal? I feel terrible about it, and really dont want anyone to see my arm. But I cant hide it forever, and my girlfriend will see it eventually. I can hide it from other people, but not her. I just wanted to escape my thoughts but they have only turned worse as a result of what I did. Usually Ill just hit my knuckles into walls, until I physically cant do it anymore. But that heals faster, from what Ive heard this can take a while. ampx200B Sorry about the poor phrasing, Im Swedish. Thank you for reading.",
    "Nothing helps. No matter what I do. Ill start my semesters of college with straight As, keep them till 23rds of the way through, then lose focus and end up with Cs or D and have to retake some classes. Im trying to stick with my career goal of becoming a teacher but at this rate Im still like 4 years away and Im already 21, making minimum wage. Im an absolute loser who nobody could love because I have no confidence. Confidence pisses me off, I just try to do whats required of me to get to where I need to be and that alone crushes me. Who could love somebody that has to fight to get themselves out of bed every morning? If I try to love myself, I just realize Im lying about my accomplishments and Ill take it too easy on myself and not get anything done. I should be squashed like an insect for being so useless. I just want somebody to blow my brains out and rid the world of my incompetence and then nobody would have to worry about me. Everyone worries about how many mistakes I make, how much I fuck up, how I cant keep my shit together consistently and just keep running in circles. Id rather just admit defeat and die. And so many people in the world probably think those like me should. Im beyond saving it feels like and my brain is too fried to cling to any one thing. I just want everything to be true so I can stop worrying about being wrong all the time. I dont even make sense anymore.",
    "feeling lost and lonely I have zero friends and its been that way since grade 10 so give or take 4 or 5 years. I had a friend group in my freshman year but I found myself less happy around them and when i went to a new high school i distanced myself from everyone and this is where it all started. Found myself insecure around others and got really uncomfortable out of nowhere. im now 20, never been to a party and have zero friends and when someone tries to be friends with me i think its weird. Ive only had toxic relationships my whole life. Between friendships and a couple relationships. Im a talented, funny, really likeable girl but i dont think i can relax around people and enjoy it at all. tbh i hate it. i dont wanna be like this forever im extremely lonely but this has been a ongoing problem for years and i feel like im experiencing a much deeper mental disorder than i let on. i just dont know what it is. Im EXTREMELY insecure also. Because im alone 247 and never chat with anyone and have no family, my thoughts drive me insane and there SO loud. I have fun by getting drunk alone in my room. My depression has turned physical and ive been experiencing intense chest tightening to the point where it feels like im struggling to breathe and ive been trying to distress and balance it out a bit. I spend hours a day in my room daydreaming and talking to myself. Its what i enjoy now and the most fun i have. I feel disconnected from my surroundings and reality. I just dont know what to do i fear im stuck here forever. Can anyone atleast somewhat relate? What can i do?",
    "I am so tired And I want someone to see that. To not think I am vein or naive, instead looking into me. Looking at my pain, my struggles, my scars, my fighting, and be grateful.

    "I'm starting medication tomorrow Im starting medication tomorrow. Im scared. Ive felt like this for as long as I can remember, Im 21, and had a shit time at school starting at 13, threw myself into studies to cope, got into a good uni, but its always been to distract myself not because I like it, and the works gotten harder and I have nothing outside of it except very supportive bf who is the main reason Im still here. Trying not to self harm or worse, and today I realized that whatever medication does to me, Ill be alive to deal with it, and that might not be the case if I dont start taking it. Spoke to GP, and I can pick it up tomorrow. Im so scared itll make things worse, but I cant cope with how I am now. Still have the stupid feeling that Im not depressed enough to deserve meds, but that particular little internal voice can suck it. Any tips?",
    "I feel lonely even though there's no need to Last time she cancelled the plan nearly two weeks ago and I havent heard from her since. I have social anxiety and even though that got a lot better during the last years it can still be an awful big challenge for me to message someone on my own especially if I really care about that person. In these cases I can overcome myself after some time but it seems to be me doing the work way too often. Something you got to know is that Im someone who likes to live for the good of others. I love to do stuff for my friends and make them happy. When my friends are happy, so am I. But obviously in a friendship theres always two parts. All I would want is an occasionally message from these people who are so important to me. Just a simple thing that makes me realize that at least in that very moment I was in their thoughts. Show me that you thought of me and Im the happiest person. But leave me in the dark for weeks and I fall into a big hole. Worst thing is that there are so many people who talk to me daily and who show that they care about me daily. And even though Im surrounded by so many people close to me I still feel lonely simply because the desire in my heart for these other friends have a whole different weight. I feel bad to feel lonely because I have no need to. Because I know that there are many people who would love to have what I do. Im a very emotional person and I can hardly cope with pain like this. Sometimes I ask them why we dont message each other more often. And days after that we do, but then it stops again. Then it feels like they only did it because I asked them to. So I practically did the work again and it thus it makes me feel worse than before. Obviously I know that we arent as close as we once were. I know that they are probably busy with life Im unemployed so Im trapped with my thoughts very often and that they have other people closer to them who they probably rather spend time with. But I dont see how it is hard work to think about my friends at least once in some weeks.",
    "What is the point? I have been suffering from depression i suppose all my life. However, acknowledgment of it only came 34 years ago. Since acknowledging i have depression, each passing year since I get worst and worst. These last two years have been my lowest with contemplation of harm getting harder to ignore. My 30th birthday was earlier this year and 4 days leading to it the idea of not seeing that birthday was painfully strong. I have no social life. the one friend that i confided in, that relationship has drastically changed. I have no romantic life, and havnt dated in 6 years. and i have no career, recently quitting my job as my mental health plumited, however now i dont think i am good enough for any job so the motivation to look just brings about anxiety and self hate. Note that i have been on lexapro for the last 5 months with my dossage being raised last week, and although it helps regulate my moods a littler better, I am still incredibly sad and hate the pathetic state of my life. I also started therapy the same time i got the perscription and see them one a week. However, although talking out my feelings gives me temporary relief i still dont know the tools needed to be better. I am incredible lonely and dont want to feel this heaviness and self hatred anymore. I guess the reason for my post is to find out if anyone has genuinely overcome their depression to the point that they can say they are truly happy. Or is this something I will have to fight with for the rest of my life, because if it is then what is the point?",
    "Managing depression forever How do you cope with knowing that depression is a mental illnessstate that never really gets cured or goes away? How do you cope with knowing that youll never be at peace or happy? Im struggling a lot with this. Im trying to work on it in therapy, but it feels very much like the dark cloud will never recede and Ill always be going through life with a sense of dread covering everything I do. How can I ever be satisfied with simply managing or coping instead of really progressing and finding a good stable place to be? Im constantly dreading whats coming or feeling guilty at the things Ive failed to do in the past and it feels never ending and hopeless.",
    "I really want to die, but feel like I can't say it. So Ive been suicidal for 78 years, have a plan, have access to the plans mean of suicide but everytime I mention it the copsambulance are called. I take 30mg Diazepam 180mg pregabalin 12mg buprenorphrine  day. Only the buprenorphine is on a script, the others were prescribed but cutoff about 4 years ago, since then Ive been using the darknet for the diazepam and pregabalin. It is proper medication sourced from spain, with leaflets everything I even sent some samples to Energy Control and they came back fine, 100 what it says on the box. Right now, my GP, my drugworker, my psych are all aware of this me buying illegally from the darknet and giving zero shits but I mentioned Im feeling suicidal to my drugworker pretty much as always, and a CRISIS team was told about it. They called and setup an appointment that I went to today. My worries are that in the past, ambulancepolice teams have turned up to my house and take all my illegal diazpregabs I have no illwill towards the cops, they have to. But it forces me through a 72hour withdrawal until I can place another order and see the psych team who just ask Are you suicidal?, are you going to kill youself today? No? Okay you can go. So now Im feeling like I shouldnt tell anyone, thoughts?",
    "Thought I would share this here It all seemed perfect, like it was made FOR me. Problems started emerging in September, first of all it was difficult to find flights to Spain, but then on the night me and my father were supposed to fly, he checked to see if he had all the documents with him, and sadly his pass was past due. So I had to fly alone, and I had no time to process what had just happened, I had to stay focused. Then I received a mail from college stating that those introduction weeks had to be canceled due to Covid casing rising again in the city. I tried to pull through thinking all would be better once classes started, but soon after I got a second mail stating that classes would be mixed so almost all classes would be takes online bar Maths and Physics. Then the third mail came in stating that classes would be taking Online until further notice, possibly until March or february. At this point I had a full on emotional breakdown all the anxiety, nostalgia, frustration and anger came rushing in , I felt I was lied to by College authorities, though they dont control covid , they did tell me that for newcomers classes would be given at campus. So after 1 month I decided I had enough of my European adventure and came back home. This is where I guess my depression started. I now have been accepted by a local Uni, but it doesnt feel rewarding, as it should , it feels empty. I feel like a coward, a loser , like I was not good enough and gave up on my dreams. Like I will never have another opportunity to leave , and that I will be stuck here forever wandering what if... most of all I feel disappointed in myself and extremely sad, and though I do have my familys support, I feel like they dont quite get me, and frankly like they are running out of patience. I dont know, I guessed I needed a space to vent and let my thoughts and feelings out, although it may be silly. I apologize for the long read, and I dont want to sound like a pan y whiny brat with first world problems but , truth be told is that I didnt knew what else to do to express what Im feeling. Thank you , have a happy Christmas.",

My social media likes have gone from 100 to 0 real fast and I have no self esteem any more. I wonder if I whined about my image too much and if my friends just hate me now or got sick of me.

    "Who should I talk to Im not gonna lie, these last two years have been my worst. I dont want to talk to my parents about it because I dont want them to worry. Ive tried to hide it from my friends by making jokes about my insecurities and my low self esteem. I want to talk to them about it but they might not take it seriously because Ive joked so much about it.

    "I’m not sure if I have depression, please reply, I made posts to other subreddits and no one answered and it’s making me feel even worse Then in high school I finally made friends. During 10th grade my friend told me that my crush of 6 years called me super ugly and said who would want to date her? That shattered everything. And now I believe that Im so repulsive that I will never find love and I will be lonely forever. Fortunately, I made friends, and one cool thing I do with a group Im really close with is that we have therapy sessions and we talk about our problems and try to cheer each other up. Ive yet to have my session yet, but I accidentally gave away that I hate my body and they think I have body dysmorphia, I think I have it too but I cant say cause I havent been diagnosed. Honestly it made me feel so good that there were people who were concerned about me but that never happened again. They never speak about it like they speak about other friends problems... Thats probably because I havent told them all this, and I wouldve but Im afraid. What if all of this is me being too dramatic. And that what Im feeling isnt serious and they think bad of me. And Im scared to go to a therapist because of that same reason. So I rather keep all these emotions inside, and almost every night I cry because of these problems. Most of the times at night, I feel empty, lifeless. If I close my eyes I imagine Im floating through space lifeless. My thoughts are very dangerous because I keep thinking more negative, and to avoid that I go on my phone and distract myself by doing something. Because of my disease I have to take pills daily, and Ive always thought that I have an easy chance to kill myself by taking a lot of them, but I dont think I would because its a sin in my religion, but maybe one day Im too down that I might do something... Can someone please tell me if this is depression or not, because I really want to overcome it. Please reply to this, Ive made many posts on other subreddits regarding this and no one has answered, which makes me feel like no one truly cares. Thank you.",
    "SO says it's depression linked. How to stop being too much? Hello Lengthy post, so Im sorry in advance if I waste your time, I am diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, however I believe it doesnt affect my day to day life enough to claim anything because others have it worse and most likely would be a waste on me anyway. When Im a member of a team, I feel too insignificant in comparison to colleaguesteam mates to ever say or put in any input. I have explained to others that I see it as If I have to work really hard to keep the job, and they can chill  lounge around and still keep the job thats equal to mine, they must have more value than me, therefore I have to try harder and respect them as my superior. My managers and colleagues say Im too much and oldfriends have ended friendships due to me being too nice. At parties and gatherings, I decide to stay quiet because I believe Ill ruin the entire night and I find it easier to seek out those that arent enjoying themselves to then go over, give them a bit of social motivation, make myself a laughing stock for them to laugh with their new friends and allow them to enjoy the night from then on without me intefering and potentially making it worse. I have been told all my life I am too much, or just too something, but its more of an insult now, even if it is said with positive intention. I just want to be enough. Nothing more, nothing less. This has come around due to my mother saying I would have done so much better in my life if I didnt focus on helping others so much, but I didnt even realise I was focusing. She tells me Im too nice about once a month. After talking to my current SO, she says it is depression. Thank you for your time, and sorry for wasting time if you read this and dont know how to help, OQPATY",
    "Being the boyfriend. I feel as if weve stopped growing and are maybe even starting to resent each other, which is scary to me. I get paranoid that shes cheating on me sometimes, which I highly doubt she is, I think its just me trying to rationalize the lack of sex. Most of all I feel like this entire relationship is about her, and its frustrating me lately. I honestly dont mean to sound like a jerk here Im certainly not entitled to anything and while I know her story better than anyone I have no idea what it was really like to experience those traumas growing up and how it effects her today. I dont even know how to explain how Im feeling. Im constantly having the internal debate Well what about me? Fuck about you! What about her!? And so on. While writing this post I kind of caught myself switching between my 2 headspaces. Headspace A That being said.. why cant it be about me sometimes? Shouldnt a relationship be 5050? Ive really never been an attention seeker so Im fine with 3070 or 2080? Anything at this point. Its not though, everything we do is dictated by her depression. Headspace B A few weeks ago while I was alone doing laundry I just started hysterically crying I couldnt breathe, it really freaked me out. Nothing like that has ever happened to me before. Earlier that day she had called me crying and saying she just wants it to be over. She just wants to give up. She wants to die I love her so much and im scared for her and for us. Am I just a shitty person for wanting it to be about me sometimes? I feel like a prick even saying that. Of course Ive never told her about this, she has enough to worry about and I want to be her rock, not another burden, a toddler, whining about not getting enough attention. So I dont say anything, instead I just get distant, which I recognize and I hate that I do that. Im just angry at this situation and dont know how else to react. I want our relationship to be what it once was fun and exciting. How can I help this relationship?",
    "My mother and I had an unsettling conversation in the midst of my depression, and I don't know how to feel... Okay, so I am teen 14M who is dealing with a lot of struggles. I have had depression for months, and I dont know what to do. I live in a smal part of a big town, which means I dont see many friends often, and Im the only one my age in that part of town. Thats bad from a start, but thats not whats triggering me... I had been dealing with my dumbass psycho ex, not able to see my gf, being bullied and cyberbullied. I have beaten myself until I bled, every day in the past 2 weeks, and I always wonder if life is worth living, and yet I still try to piece things together again. Yesterday, I had figured out that my past was a lot worse than I had originally thought, with reoccurring memories of childhood trauma. We were having a normal conversation about how I was doing at school as usual, but it took a turn quickly back to the worst childhood memories I had, which all I had forgotten until then. I had thought it was always peaceful back then since almost every childhood memory I had before then was happy. I even bring up these positive memories whenever Im down. And these memories came back. Heres what they were one by one in the order they happened The first memory, the only one I couldnt regain my perception on was one from when I was in preschool obviously. The last day I went to preschool, my mother was watching in the preschool because she noticed things werent perfectly fine there. Before it was over, a little girl who was 3 years of age, opened one of the metal doors and accidentally slammed her fingers in the doors. The tips of 3 of that girls fingers were cut off from that door and was bleeding everywhere. The staff was panicking, but they werent doing anything. They didnt call for help. They just stood and watched. The staff, also, were both 17 yearolds watching over 32 preschool kids which was illegal. My mother quickly took me out of that daycare and felt so bad for leaving me there.",
    "how do i ask for help so for a few years now ive considered myself depressed but i dont know how to talk about my feelings to anyone. i tried once to tell my mom that i was depressed, since ive never actually been diagnosed, and that ive self harmed and had suicidal thoughts. i never actually told her that i was so close to actually doing the deed per say because how do you tell your mom that her child wants to end their life. ive spend days laying in my bed and not moving a muscle, not eating, not talking to anyone even my siblings, i didnt even have the energy to get up to use the restroom. i had no energy whatsoever that i couldnt even cry i just laid there in silence looking at my wall and hugging my dogs as they walked in and out of my room to sleep. for so long ive wanted to ask to go to therapy but anytime i talk about being sad and not feeling like myself my mom and sister tell my that i have no reason to be sad and that im just faking it. i think this all stems from childhood trauma but mostly from a past relationship that never shouldve been a relationship. it was so toxic and the worst first real relationship i ever had. it ruined me mentally and emotionally. the jealousy, the controlling, the emotional abuse, the pain we caused each other, just the whole relationship was horrible and i deeply regret ever getting into a relationship with her. it was always so crazy to me how everyone thought our relationship was perfect and nothing but happiness when in reality it was tearing me apart yet i couldnt get away from it. maybe i stayed because i didnt wanna be alone or maybe it was because i liked the attention she gave me, all i know it there was never any actual love in the relationship. it was just lust and the thought of us being together and having a future. i just dont wanna be sad anymore. i want to happy like actually happy not just moments of relief and distraction from the pain. how do i tell someone that i want or need help without feeling so vulnerable and embarrassed by my emotional baggage",

She tells her parents who are doing a very shit job at looking after their daughter btw that shes just not feeling well or she pretends to eat and gets away with it. She also has terrible mood swings, one minute shes happy, joyful, playful, laughing, the next shes depressed, crying, suffocating herself in her blanket, cutting herself..... this is all over facetime because her parents are not allowing me to see her as they are very strict so her mood just changes out of nowhere and whenever I try to bring up her needing help or asking if somethings wrong she gets really upset. Shes terrible at taking care of herself and has proclaimed many times I hate myself, thats why but never goes into detail. She names many things about herself that she hates but I dont think those are why she does everything she does, and if it is thats why I suggest for her to get help but she refuses all the time. She never eats, never drinks water, barely sleeps, does everything she can when shes sick to make herself worse such as drinking coffee and staying up, she never takes her medication, she purposely hurts herself, she doesnt open up, she doesnt respect her own values and boundaries, hell she threw away her inhaler because of whatever reason but she needs it so she doesnt die from a coughing fit due to her thyroidism, which she doesnt do anything to help either. She never allows herself to warm up when shes cold, she suffocates herself in a blanket, she doesnt take her meds for it, its sad more than it is upsetting if Im being honest. Lately she has been getting rid ofblocking out people who are helping her, which is why Im glad I convinced her to let me talk to her about this tomorrow, but anyways she convinced her stupid ass useless parents that she doesnt need a therapist anymore, she doesnt tell her doctor anything, she doesnt open up to her parents understandable because they get mad or brush it off.",

Small goals dont feel rewarding and holding myself accountable never helps because I dont know why i should care what even i think. I know thats silly but thats literally how empty i am.

How could I do that with him, when he probably didnt know what he would do with the rest of my life. ampx200B I just cant love him. I hate him. Sometimes I wish he was dead. Then I blame myself because I know that if he dies Im going to feel very guilty. ampx200B But I dont know. I dont know if Im gay, straight, bisexual. God I even have considered the probability that Im trans, autistic, mental Ill, once I even considerate that I have AIDS. But I dont, I already made blood test. ampx200B I think Im becoming insane. Lately I have been considering suicide a lot but... I just cant do this to my sister. Shes 7 now and I love her deeply. But, at the same time, if I tell this secret, I might ruin my family forever. ampx200B I just feel like Im slowly dying. My childhood dreams have disappeared. I have no future. I dont what to do. I dont have friends. ampx200B If you read this entirely. Im so grateful. I dont know who you are. But I love you. Thank you for being the only person that heard me.",
    "Every day is unbearable \"TW\" For so long now I have been struggling with depression. I ended up in a psychiatric hospital a few years back due to multiple attempts of sui. Since then I have had therapy, I am aware that I have to be here, that I have to stay unhappy and that is what is most frustrating. Every single day from the moment I wake up, I want the day to be over with. I dread the cycle of the day starting again, being a parent to three kids is exhausting. I love them to the ends of the earth but I know full well that they deserve more than me, thankfully my partner is amazing. I can no longer settle in the nights, I used to watch a tv series or play a game or read but I cant focus on any of it. Life just feels so pointless. I feel like I am just forcing myself to go through the motions to keep everyone happy but I am not. I have tried so hard and for so long to get better. Ive followed all the advice Ive been given but yet im still here feeling like this. Meds dont do anything. I just want to enjoy life again, I am 24 years old and I feel like I cant keep going on like this. Im so drained",

    "Saw a therapist today ... what’s next? Today I finally saw a therapist to figure out why Ive lost my zest for everything in life. Job. Hobbies. Etc etc etc. I dont leave the house anymore and my friends group is at a bare minimum. I miss going to the gym, and definitely miss my ladymuscles. Our next appointment is for the 22nd, at which point we will address treatment. I want to learn how to help myself. I was happy before and believe I can be again. But I dont want to wait 13 days to start. I want to start making steps towards progress now. What are some small things I can do that youve found successful in the past to get yourself up and moving again? Do I force myself to go to the gym X times a week? Make appointments with myself? What about socialization? Anything small will do. Im just so happy to know theres a community on Reddit fighting the same battles I thought I was alone in. Cheers",
    "Breaking up gave me depression.. and I want to speak my mind.. please be nice. However, at the end of the day, I know that I am responsible for my happiness and I have to drag myself to the place I want to be. This break up has been a roller coaster, there are days that I feel like Im getting better, and there are days like today, where I feel like this will never stop. Hopefully, I will get through this soon and live my best life.",
    "Coping with online shopping I have struggled with depression over many years and a way Ive found to cope with it is to online shop, Ill buy the most pointless stuff for no reason.

    "Being in lockdown would be great if I was literally anywhere else Long story short while in the middle of a panic attack my dad threatened to have me sanctioned. If you dont know what that means, he told me he was perfectly comfortable hospitalising me against my will. Im terrified of hospitals. This was the day lockdown was put in place uk this incident was a catalyst for a downward spiral and Im now in a depressive episode. I have work due in under a week and I cant force myself to do it. If I dont submit I will not be able to get my degree. Im tired and experiencing some really bad thoughts. I cant talk to anyone irl about this apart from my therapist but my appointment isnt for another week. I dont really know what Im expecting from this but putting it out there and helps sometimes. So here I am, doing that, I guess.",
    "What if it’s scientifically impossible to get better As the the title says what if its just scientifically impossible. Think how millions of people commit suicide, whos to say that any of them had a chance of getting better. While sure other people recover from depression, we all know depression works on a scale, whos to say there isnt a cut off point in which there is literally no hope for recovery? Obviously we dont know everything about the brain so this is entirely a possibility. I dont know if this is even requesting support to be honest as, I feel like, as my post suggests, support might just be useless and Im destined to die depressed. I guess this is more of a last minute cry for help before I just give up and accept Im gonna kill myself at some point",

    "My self care plan, and I'd appreciate some further advice. Hello everyone, Im a 26 year old woman and I suffer from depression. Im in therapy and on antidepressants. I attempted suicide in April 2018 but, since then, Ive made a lot of progress and Im quite happy with myself. But loneliness is still a major trigger for my depression. Tomorrow Ill leave for another city because I have to participate in a public competition for a workplace Im in Italy so, in order to work for the Government, you have to participate to public selections. Problem I dont know anyone in this city so Ill be alone for seven days. Yes, Ill meet other people who apply for the same selection, but at the end of the day Ill return to my hotel room and Ill be alone. And Im very scared. This is my self care plan, that I organized with my therapist  focusing on the public selection  bringing my favourite books  Netflix for the nights  going to fine restaurants and enjoying good food  visiting the city in my spare time  calling my SO andor friends if I really feel overwhelmed Do you have any other advice? Im a bit anxious. Thank you!",
    "Two Faced People - Need Advice So basically, today in college we had a 15 minute break and my mate and I went out of college we went to the shops. We came back at the end of the break and as soon as we walked in this girl said speaking of the devil. We were just speaking about you and she was saying about my mate. I sat down on my seat and I got a message from my mate telling me that they were chatting shit about me, these two girls. They were going on about how I was ugly and how I cant get any girls and stuff. It didnt bother me about what they said, but should I have said something back, Im not really looking for drama especially right now where I have a situation going on with a girl. I just want some advice on what I shouldve done or next time if I catch them talking about me. By the way, I didnt say anything to them girls, they said this randomly. Also, I am not a player or anything either so I dont know why she would have said that.",
    "I don’t know what is happening First of all, hello everyone and thank you for taking the time to read this. Ive been dealing with a lot of stuff recently and I think Ive done pretty good in regards how to deal with it but I still need some additional inspiration andor advice or you know, just someone who will listen because my friends have been listening to this a lot and I dont want to burden them with this any further. I was dating a guy from January until pretty recently and we were always on the brink of getting serious when he decided to distance himself from me because I think he was scared or something I dont blame him then in may I found out that I was pregnant 4w  3 d when I found out and I told him. He got extremely angry when I told him and that resulted in us having this really bad argument over if I should keep the baby or not and I was not budging because I thought it was in my best interest to keep the baby but then one thing led to another and I had a miscarriage the same day as I told him about the pregnancy and he seemed relieved that I had the miscarriage. But then yesterday I told him that I had to stop seeing him because I met a guy who treats me better and what not I hadnt talked to the guy I had been seeing for a few weeks so I assumed that it was over and he decides to tell me that he loves me he worded it like this even though its not in that way I love you and really care about you and I told him that I love him as a friend and that I really care about him too, later on he proceeded to tell me that he regrets how he acted towards me when I was pregnant and he now sees that we could have coparented well and that he wishes things wouldnt have happened like they did. I dont know how to feel about this because when he brought up the miscarriage I started to feel like I did when it happened because I still want that baby even though its gone and I know I can never get it back. Is it weird that I still want to be pregnant and is it weird that this chat of ours brought back the feelings that I had previously suppressed towards him?",
    "Fell in love with a married woman 2 years ago Fell deeply in love with a married woman two years ago and she came over to my place and her husband found out. I have been drinking everyday for 1.5 years after we had to break contact. I have also stalked her several times each day looking on facebook who she likes and who likes her. Have talked to her when I see her and how much I love her and how much feelings she has for me. I broke down this christmas after I quit watching pornography and realized she has found a new man behind his back and she is most likely trying to start a relationship with him. I ask her when I see her but I also push her further away. Today I told her I will leave her alone. All that I can think of is ending it. Any hope left?",
    "My friends left me, whats wrong with me and how do I fix it? So Im a teenager right now about to start my junior year of high school. I just want some help honestly, because no matter what I do, no one likes me. Im not sure why. I like to think that Im kind and nice or something, but it seems that a lot of people dont think that, or theyll say it and then take it back later somehow. Ive been told Im funny, and then later that I should stop making jokes because its not my thing. Its like Im interesting at first, Im funny, Im nice, Im as what my ex best friend described me as The best friend I always wished for. But then a few months later she said that I was toxic and that I was lucky she was going to give me another chance because I could be a good friend when I wanted to be. Then a month after that, she apparently had to delete her discord, but from mutual friends I heard that she was still on there daily. Just recently shes messaged me asking to make contact again. I pretended to not see it, because honestly I really thought she was my best friend. I made animatic type videos of us together, so I basically drew us together hundreds of times. We did everything together as well. But I just cant understand what happend, why she just had the sudden change of mind that I wasnt a good friend anymore. Its not like we were in a fight or anything, it was just that I started talking too her less than we usually did Our normal was like 3 hours a day because of covid, and then during this time it was more like 1 hour I kept up my same upbeat and funny persona that I try to play, but she just... she left me. My other friend was a guy who hung out with us. After about a month of covid, he ghosted us and would only ever make contact by texting andor commenting on things we made saying cringe or oh god... and then not responding after that. After about 6 months I got fed up with this so I wrote him a essay on how ghosting and making only rude comments isnt nice and that I was sort of hurt that he was doing this.",
    "Does it ever get better? I hope with all my heart that life gets better. That I am escape the isolation and depression, but I just lack sufficient evidence. I want to believe you can change your life, but are there really any success stories? Can someone truly comeback from the brink? I cant withstand the sexless loneliness, isolation, intimacy deprived existence I live. Im in school and I know what I want to do but its a very, very slim margin I make it. Im couch surfing and scrounging by. Nothing looks good right now.

    "Being laughed at The sound of my mom laughing cant exit my mind. I told her I wanted to learn psychology, yet she forced me to learn engineering. I barely survived math in high school. Man it sucks . I dont wanna fail her yet I dont wanna learn this subject. Even if she laughed at my dream , shes still my biological mom. She raised me . But.. I tried talking to her but it doesnt change anything. I love my mom. but Im not really cut out for math. Do anyone have any tips rather than talk to her slowly?",
    "Help me, please. I have 0 friends in the literal sense. I have been living like this for more than 3 years I try to contact my first and old friends in Facebook and although they enthusiastically answer we can never get together, and even if we could I would be so embarassed to share with them what my life has become. I have learned to live with it, especially after I got psychological support for some months last semester and even if talking to a therapist was a great relief I felt it was useless. When I was in therapy I was reading at the same time some books of selfimprovement but that only created in me a temporary but potent energy and when this energy disappeared I returned to this drab, insipid state. I was in a very decent social circle when I was in school I am not from the US so this will be difficult to explain, I studied where the rich people and the children of important persons of my country studied so I had what you call good connections and in here you start with the same classmates when you are 3 years old and end with the same classmates when you are 1718 so we graduate very close to each other emotionally. I feel like I have left that circle and I cant return, I dread that situation of me presenting myself again to those persons and it feels that as years pass they get closer together while I isolate myself more. My mom always says that University is the best time of the life because you party, go with friends are more independent, and you begin to flourish, grow up and create good or bad experiences. Not for me, I feel like I am in standby, I just watch people have fun. Today I observed my classes to see if there was anyone else like this but everyone had at least one person to talk to. You may say that it is ok to not party if you dont like although I do like to party from times to times and get drunk, its just there isnt anybody I can do that with and even if I didnt like to go to clubs I see everyone with different interests and mindsets forming groups according to what they like, WHY DO I FEEL LIKE I AM NOT PART OF ANY GROUP??? I feel like I dont have any identity that I can show, I feel empty because I have a big fear of being judged for what I am.",

    "How to get brave enough to kill yourself PLEASE NOTE I am not in any danger to myself at this time so no need for urgency. TLDR self hate, worthlessness, getting over fear of death. Im just so tired of living. Ive always hated myself and people since a very early age and I cannot trust anyone. I feel absolutely wrong in this world. Everything I do or say or think is wrong. Since day one I was wrong. I cant do anything right like honestly not trying to exaggerate here and cant make any connections with anyone. Im actually unable to feel love or compassion or any sort of human connection. Dont even get me started on sex Im sick of watching everyone else get what I cant have. I dont deserve love or kindness and Im honestly sick of being the brunt of a very boring joke. I feel like the universe is constantly telling me I dont belong here I also feel like Im not THAT important to have the universe specifically pick on me. My role in this world is to be unremarkable and useless. I only see evil in the world, I can see no kindness. As long as there is man men, there can be on peace. Since the dawn of time weve chosen violence, death and hate. Even in the 21st century we still are starting wars, having genocides and famine and humans are becoming less and less human or more human?? I cant hold onto friendships or make any solid connections. I can only make friend with people who need someones shoulder to cry on and once theyre done with me, theyre gone. I also cling onto anyone that stays remotely too long and then feel utterly betrayed by the smallest problem they face me with. I freak out at the smallest things like dropping a spoon or having a giant mess. I used to be able to pretend to be happy and healthy and human but, as usual, I cant do that right so Im slipping. I cant stay at a job for longer than a year without freaking out. I work at a job Ive wanted for so long but see how little work or care is actually put in by my fellow coworkers and its maddening.",

Just an hour I talked to a friend i meet online and she told me to try new routines and try to change my mind set from everything right now is useless and nothing matters to something else she never told me. But the thing Is that I cant just change my mind set and that makes me even more sad because I tell myself I cant be better and almost everyone are better than me. But when I meet someone that isnt better than me I say bad things and push them away to make them feel worse. Also recently I find myself starring into nothing or a mirror and just thinking what would happen if I would die and who honestly would care. Also also when I think about this sort of stuff I dont cry or do anything physical like that I just get sad and keep thinking.",

Every attempt Ive tried fails, people have walked over me and used me so bad that I never regained the confidence to make something of myself.

    "This is a cry for help... But, I was heartbroken cause I couldnt believe Jane wasnt loyal and committed to me. One night, she told me that shes scared cause she feels like she is one of those girls who meant nothing to me. I told her she was insane and Im in love with her. Until one day when we were at one of my friends house and we were alone, I started making love to her. we didnt have much time so she got pissed off and told me that I was so selfish and I just wanted her for sex and left. This led to our breakup. The next few days we fought and she started flirting with other guys. I couldnt believe everything was falling apart. She told me that she loved me so much but she thinks that I dont love her so her love for me has faded away. She told me that her personality makes her want to date older guys and Ive been acting like a kid. Break can you believe age is this much important for girls in Iran? Well you cant blame them cause they have a lot of father issues, but I really didnt expect it from Jane. I couldnt believe what I heard. I was totally mature and loyal and honest about our relationship and the person who was acting like a kid was Jane the whole fucking time. But I got accused of acting like a kid. We broke up and she blocked me on everything. Its been 3 months since we broke up and it happened in the worst possible time. I couldnt hangout with my friends to ease the pain cause of quarantine. I was lonely the whole time. After quarantine was finished in Iran, I started hanging out with my friends and stuff but there is still a crushing pain deep down in my chest. And you wanna know something funny? I heard she got back together with that asshole who treated her like shit. Obviously knowing that she is this much immature made me realize I dont love her anymore. But I still miss that feeling. I miss being happy in a relationship. I miss being in love. Ive been seeing a therapist since we broke up and she helped me to ease the pain a lot but, Im still extremely depressed.",
    "How do you pull yourself together when you're not motivated? Hello. I 23F have tried to make a post to explain whats going on with me, but I just end up crying, and everything I write is incoherent, so. Sorry if theres not enough context? Im having a really difficult time right now. I cant really focus on work, and I dont get in as many hours as I should. I feel like I am letting people down. Existing is exhausting, and all I can do is waste time on my phone, because if Im on my phone I dont have to think and time passes more quickly. Im tired of spending hours on my phone instead of doing functionalpeople things, Im just putting everything off and setting myself up for failure. But doing anything productive feels too daunting, and I dont know how to start? I want to develop healthy habits  spend less time on my phone, maybe go outside more often, go on walks, stick to my work schedule, find hobbies. Simple things that I know would improve my mental health. But even though I want those things, I feel like Im not motivated enough to make a change. Its always easier to stay in my comfort zone, to distract myself. My brain says I need to change, but I feel like I dont want it bad enough to actually try. I cant keep living like this, though. Ive tried looking for advice online, but everything I see involves  Therapy, which I dont have money for. Reaching out, but I have very few people Im close with, and I dont feel comfortable talking about my mental health to any of them. Selfhelp books and stuff, which just...does not work on me. Hobbies, but I dont really have any of those anymore? Ive been depressed for so long, Ive lost interest in the ones I used to have as a kid, and never developed new ones.

Well once I got there I found out I had to cook all the food and also my own birthday cake which is ok I guess maybe Im just being picky? But then my boyfriend starts a fight with me because I went when I thought he didnt remember and he didnt have anything planned so I ruined that as well. So now Im sitting in my bathroom in tears because my brother said that Im just being sensitive and stupid and then my boyfriend is saying that I ruined everything.

This is especially the case in pvp games, that kind I most enjoy when im winning. Even outside of video games though I cant help but to get envious of literally everyone, even if they have their own life troubles I dont realise.

Shes my friend, so of course I do my best to be there for her and listen to her problems but at the same time, its becoming a toxic situation because Ive been feeling pretty down myself, and its been taking a toll on my emotion wellbeing. I honestly dont mean to sound selfish at all, I really want to help her but I feel like its too much for me to handle. Its a tough situation because I feel like Im not fit to be her emotional support as Im going through things myself and I havent been feeling great for a while but I dont think I can tell her that, I know shes going through a lot. Sometimes I have a meltdown because I feel so much pressure and stress, i dont know how to reply to her, I dont know how to handle it.

    "I'm getting angry at my depression. I want to break out of it and I can't seem to shake it. I wasnt able to complete homework because of mental fog and everytime I opened my online class dashboard I would break down and cry until I fell asleep. I did a few assignments and it would take me half the day to write a 2 page paper. Took me a week to write a 6 page paper. I used to be able to do them in a few hours. I feel like my mind is deteriorating. Conversation is more difficult. I can easily explain my feelings because its a trait of my personality, but casual talk and reading people has become impossible. Im getting anxious because talking to people I already know is starting to feel like talking to strangers. Ive been crying my eyes out over small insecurities I used to be over and accept. Im trying to figure out how to reorganize my life but its so hard. I know people who go out and party and drink night after night and still go to college and go to work and are doing great. They are happy and healthy and only have a small nagging guilt about not getting more done. I feel like I produce NOTHING of value to the world and its so difficult to just chip away at learning a song or doing a simple assignment or task at work. All I can listen to is super depressing music as well if I want to enjoy it. I feel like a emo highschooler. My whole life Ive struggled with motivation, my parents called me a lazy piece of shit everyday and its true. Everything takes so much mental effort for me and I can barely focus because my mind goes a million miles an hour with intense imagery and nonsensical logic. To slow it down and focus on the world around me, especially the physical world, is a manual effort. The depression just makes it all the worse. I just want to know if anyone might relate and how they may have improved their lives? Ive been feeling so isolated even though I surround myself with people lately, and there are less and less reasons I want to stay around.",
    "Depressed boyfriend left Last week my depressed boyfriend left me. Even at the end he was telling me how much he loved me. And he was anguished with how much he felt made me suffer and how he thought I would be better off with someone who could give to me . This is so hard for me to understand. I wouldve helped him in anyway possible and loved and supported him until the end of my days. Even if he couldnt give back to me. He said I made him feel safe and loved and happier than anyone else. How can I make sense of this? I ask that you help me understand the perspective of a depressed person on this. Its hard for me to understand why he would give up a source of comfort and love. I love him so much and hate to think of him alone and in misery. And then I start to hate myself because I wonder if I was a better girlfriend that I could have helped him and he would not leave me. The logical part of me says that I did everything I could but my heart doesnt feel that way. At the same time I loved him so much and he knew it. Any insight would be appreciated.",
    "Letting my boyfriend commit suicide. Please help. He thinks he may be in the autism spectrum. He thinks hes incompetent and useless. He thinks hes very ugly I think he has BDD because I have it myself. The biggest issue is probably his OCD. He has severe contamination OCD, and its what hes in disability for. He says OCD is hell. One big example  He lived in a flat with Artex ceilings most of his adult life moved now and he believes hes been exposed to a lot of asbestos. He wants to end his life before lung cancer sets in. He is scared of aging and his body and mind deteriorating, getting diseases or becoming disabled and reliant on others for care. He resents this is the way things are and wants to end his life before nature can take its course. He resents life. I sympathize with all of these things and relate to many. The NHS has failed him. There seems to be no good help within his options. Hes so pessimistic about healthcare workers now that he doesnt want to try. He plans on committing suicide before summer because he thinks this flat is going to get unbearably hot. Its on the 3rdtop floor. His OCD wont allow him to use a fan because hes scared of fibers flying around, and no coolers involving water because hes worried about mold. He doesnt think a portable ac unit will be able to cool the flat down enough and that it will be very expensive. I cant personally think of another solution for the heat. I want him to know happiness, but it doesnt seem possible. I feel awful that hes stuck around for my sake. Hes missed out on sourcing the best drug for suicide now that UK customs are more strict since early January. He doesnt blame me, but it is my fault, and I really wont ever be able to forgive myself for it. Really, I do think he resents me. I dont know how to cope or how to go on myself. I need help, and I dont have anywhere to get it. Nothing makes any of this okay or better.",
    "Am i the bad guy in this situation? Okay hi im new here. I just want to know if im really a bad person for doing what i did. I worked at a bar.

    "Loneliness Lately, Ive been feeling quite lonely. For a long time, Ive dreamed of a best friend, the kind that you never let go. The kind that truly cares for you, that you can be yourself around with, do fun and stupid things with, talk about everything under the moon and that you feel a connection to like no other. I have friends. Maybe even a few I would call best friends. Weve been friends from childhood. But we barely talk or see each other. Im talking five times a year or something. I started feeling left out already when we went to highschool and it got a lot worse over time. Now that weve all gone to collage, I feel more distant from them than ever. I have even considered cutting off ties with them. I dont think I know how to build friendships anymore, or trust someone enough to become that best friend. I crave friendship and company. Im not the greatest at keeping up with people either, through text mostly but also otherwise. I always feel like the other should initiate the conversation, and I almost always end up waiting days for them to text me back, because Im too shy to.",
    "I feel my life is worthless, I'm ready to end it all, please help me. I've posted for help, and I don't know where to turn to now. I feel more depressed now than ever before in my life. Bills were piling up, and even after long hard days in the office my wife would yell, and cuss at me for wanting to smoke a pack of marlboros, and drink some budweiser in peace in my living room, in the house I pay for like I always would but for some stupid ass reason she flipped on me. She began blue balling me since then, she stopped wanting to have fun in bed, time, and time again I would go to her, try to get it on like I had done before, and I just got no love from her, she acted like a cold hearted pasty white bitch, and not just when I was looking to get it on with her. But this pattern, this taboo purgatory I now found myself in, it was nothing temporary it became a new acceptance, a new reality, a new sign of defeat for me. Not only did I now have to put up with a shitty job, in a small home, where I couldnt even relax in peace like I used to, but now my wife was cutting me off from the little bit of pleasure I found being with her. I had dedicated nothing but my whole life, finances, everything I had to our family, and now this is the thanks I got. She would tell me to go, and play, and spend time with the kids like I hadnt, when she knew damn well I was exhausted after work at night times. So I decided from then on I had to do something about this set of unfortunate circumstances I now faced. Inspired to go have some fun, and have finally a release I well deserved after work I began instead of going straight back to my prison of a home, I instead decided to go out to bars, nightclubs, telling my wife when she texted about where I was, that I was just burning the midnight oil, working hard filing paperwork, just making up job crap she wouldnt even look into anyways. At those clubs I had the time of my life. It became like an addiction to me.",
    "I hate who i am, i don't know how to change. Ive been a neet for 2 and a half years, mostly because im somewhat socially retarded, not only am i not good at making small talk or generally talking to people in real life, but i also have no interest in doing so with most of the people that are around me for whatever reason, i also use the fact that i have a heart condition that doesnt allow me to make a lot of physical effort to justify the fact that im a neet but the truth is that im mostly afraid of having to deal with people. ampx200B For the first 18 years of my life my heart condition wasnt that bad or maybe it was and i was just used to it i noticed something was wrong when i started working out and my left arm started hurting one thing led to another and now i cant drink coffee or alcohol or work out anymore, the not being able to work out part made me really depressed since working out usually just made any negative feelings i had go away for some reason, and i was determined to lose weight at the time, now im overweight have skinny arms and i dont look anything like i wish i would. ampx200B Im also not interested in pursuing higher education, i barely passed through high school and i know im just not cut out for it even though my iq is 2 whole points above the standard! ampx200B My parents feed my bad habits probably because they feel some guilt for turning out the way i am they used to scold me for being shy and not doing well in school but they also shit talked me for a lot of small things that i dont really want to remember eventually i started confronting them about it and now they dont really know how to handle me so they just kind leave me to do whatever i want, their generation was very different from mine and i dont blame them for not knowing how to deal with the modern problems i have, i kind of wish theyd threaten to kick me out or something ampx200B Now i mostly spend my time consuming media but recently ive been feeling really bad about wasting my time, if any of you have any advice or can point me to a book on self help or anything like that id appreciate it, also i dont have the money to afford any good therapy.",

I always end up going back to her because I lover her so much and was the only person to ever make me feel legitimately loved.

Yet, I see her on her snap map shes active fairly often whilst also posting on her story. Ill be on delivered for hours on end and this isnt the first time this has happened. However, when we do talk, she tells me she loves me and how I was the only person shes ever truly loved. Shell call me daddy and fantasize about us having the cutest sleepovers. Worst yet, she told me awhile ago she still loves one of her other exs. The dude doesnt even care about her depression and just uses her for sex. She doesnt see that though. I cant do this anymore.

    "How to help my husband not feel like he’s useless against my depression Ive been depressed for a long time now. Ive been struggling for as long as hes known me and it hasnt gotten any better throughout the course of our time together. Recently, hes been feeling like hes useless and cant do anything to help me when Im feeling really down and hes getting really frustrated. Needless to say this puts a strain on our relationship and how we communicate with each other. I dont know how to help him help me. Ive told him I just need him to be supportive and compassionate and loving but it frustrates him when he does that and Im still depressed.

    "I am depressed and I lost all of my friends. I feel so alone. For my entire life, I have dealt with severe persistent depression dysthymia as the diagnosis and anxiety. I have gone through a lot of stuff, especially toxic friendships throughout life. These past few months have been especially tough for me. I got involved in a relationship that didnt end up in a relationship due to his and my own mental instability. He refused to work together on it and trying to work on some things we both had issues with. This made me feel as if he didnt really care about me. Tonight he told me he definitely did not have romantic feelings for me anymore. After that, my best friend Lets call her Katie contacted me for help involving her struggling with suicidal thoughts not necessarily wanting to kill herself, more so that the thought of suicide made her anxious. Anyways, after I helped her to the best of my ability, I felt great. I want to be a therapist so this is rewarding to me if I can help anyone. But then, she told me something. I have had this other friend for a long long time. Lets call her Amy Throughout high school, Amy and I had issues because her mother absolutely despised me and created issues for our friendship. I am pretty sure she blamed a lot of stuff on me to her mom so she wouldnt get in trouble for it. As a result, I began getting left out of our friend group a lot and was treated like an outcast. She has been a pretty shitty friend to me. Last year, Amy moved away to go to a different college, which made things so much easier for me, life was going great. But this summer she moved back to town and is transferring to our hometown college. Immediately life started going back to how it used to be. Katie hangs out with them a ton and I am just alone and dont really get invited. I ended up saying something to Katie and asked her if she thinks everyone is going to start excluding me again and I said something like, Since Amy moved back, everyone flocks to her like she is crack. This is not a great thing to say but I was frustrated and panicking at the time.",

    "Am I to blame for my boyfriends depression? Me and my boyfriend have a really good relationship most of the time. We want the same things and are usually very in sync, until we have a minor disagreement. To me they are mainly about trivial things like chores, but they always escalate because of how we both act. I get frustrated and either get angry and shout or really upset and cry. He just leaves, actually packs up his bags and leaves home. This happened again yesterday and he left. He came to pack his stuff today and after begging him he eventually opened up to me. He said he feels like a shadow of himself with work, friends, family and that he feels so much better away from me. He said some nasty things yesterday but this was really what he thought, and it really hurt me. Ive been doing some research and think he is depressed, I managed to get him to agree to get help today and said i would give him space for a couple of weeks while hes basically said hes seeing if hes better without me. I can barely breathe without him, and while I am so upset that he has treat me this way I just want him to come back to me. What happens if he realises he doesnt need me? i have no appetite or enthusiasm for anything and dont know how im going to function enough to go to work, let alone make it through the next 2 weeks, or longer, alone",

I switched to Wellbutrin and didnt even have any side effects, I felt like I was taking a sugar pill in the morning because it also didnt help at all.

Over the past six months, I started having mental problems, and I cannot find the strength in myself even to go to a psychiatrist. And on the one hand, I would very much like to forget her, because I know that we will never even communicate with her now. On the other hand, I am so afraid to forget her, because for me she was the center of my universe. Hell, really, if I really had the opportunity to kill myself, if I had a bad relationship with my family, if I didnt know that my family would not survive this, I would go and kill myself at that very moment, when she said she didnt want to talk to me anymore. What I really would like right now is some inoperable cancer just to slowly fall into the grave. Im 26, and I have never been fully reciprocated by one girl. I visited 8 friend zones. But the most offensive is this one, the last one. Because Im an idiot. I know that she could be mine if I was more persistent. Now, I look at myself 5 years ago and want to shout to myself Idiot! You ruin everything! Take a step!, But I cant, because Im not a magician. I dont think so, but I know that I will never be happy in my life. That I would work a job that I would hate until my parents were gone. And right after that, Ill just kill myself, because it wont make sense for me to stay alive anymore.

    "advice on intrusive thoughts? So a couple of months ago, I did a thing where I memorized some phone number of a person that I dont get along with anymore. This has caused me to go on bouts of depression, lamenting about how my brain only memorizes information that is irrelevant, and how I wish I could forget everything. Long story short, it was a terrible friend breakup that developed into all kinds of mental illness, including OCD. I get the feeling sometimes that if I dont look to see what this person is doing, I feel like death. This is harmful for me, because I know that its a habit that Ive made and Ive now put a lot of weight in this. I told myself during corona that I want to start focusing on doing better and being better. All of this has weighed me down for 3 years now. How do you guys deal with intrusive thoughts? Is there a way to purposefully forget information? I feel like the amount of work Ive been putting in has been pretty good so far, but I can always be doing better. Theres no pathways for this shit. p.s. yes I am definitely in therapy!",
    "Will it ever go away? (Self Harm/ suidical thoughts-- Trigger warning!) Will it ever go away? I thought that I beat this sht, but what happened last night said otherwise. I have suffering from depression for a whole year! It started last year, 2 semesters ago, with it being compounded with ADHD led to an emotional devastation. It had gotten so bad that I would self harm everynight using an absurdly sharp keys to scratch my upper right arm I am a lefty and one night I decided to cut myself three times using scissors. During that semester I would often write I wrote like Da vinci to make it harder for others to read! things about the emotional pain and that I wanted to die. After the semester was over my mom pressured me to get help. I was put on meds. After awhile and an additional medication I felt better, though took awhile to feel better. Fastforward to today, well last night. When I just bursted into tear and cried myself to sleep, and lately I been having passive suicidal thoughts and I sometimes wish that one night that I will go to sleep and not wake up. In addition, to ADHD and depression I also got GAD and I had a panic attack today YAYYAYAYAYYAY!!. My depression is coming back, and now I have issues with GAD, and the only thing I want is for my depression and GAD to go away! I am tired of suffering, depression and GAD needs fck off!",

I pushed some of my old friends from church away by ghosting them without explanation. I even saw on Facebook that some of my old friends went to the Pride March. One of them was even an old friend Ive been meaning to catch up with, but still couldnt. I regret isolating myself from them until we are no longer close to each other. I wish I could be brave enough. Then again, my familys religious and my dad would flip since hes an active member in our Catholic churchchoir. Im not as religious as I was back then. I might consider myself as an agnosticatheist now though theres still some part of me that believes theres a God up there I wish to be free from this pain.",

    "Gf won't get help because she doesn't want to change TLDR gf wont get help. She doesnt want to be on medstherapy because it means she isnt herself, so its kinda like she just wants to be depressed with the idea that eventually she will kill herself What can I do? Im drowning here",
    "Feeling Super Stuck - Would Love Some Advice I grew up in an abusive home, and was abused basically daily from about the age of four until I left at 16. Turns out that the only other abusive relationship Ive ever been in is with the person Im currently married to. There was never physical abuse in my marriage, and my childhood trauma definitely factors in here. I could go on for pages describing the history and the current dynamics, but Ill keep to the point by saying that Ive made huge strides in understanding my mental health, that I know myself quite well, and that the chances of me being happy and fulfilled in the marriage are zero. Theres been a mountain of therapy, tonnes of conversations, over several years. Ive been the this is fine meme for about four years now and I just cant do it any more. If it wasnt for our daughter, I would have broken up long ago. Ive stayed because of her, and Ive done my best to make the relationship work. Its clearly not working though, and Im feeling painfully stuck and Im miserable. I have every reason in the universe to leave except for one reason, and shes an amazing little human that I cant imagine abandoning. So yeah, I have no frigging idea what to do. Staying in this relationship is a terrible option. I cant afford to live in Houston without a job. Working remotely for a company in Canada is an option, but most pay terribly and I havent had any luck landing one yet. Homelessness is technically an option, but not really. I could go back to my old job in Canada any time, but thats a 23 hour drive away not counting traffic and bathroom breaks. I dont have anyone in my life I can talk to about this, so Im hoping for a little bit of emotional support here. This situation has me feeling unresolvable stuck, and for the first time in my life at times Im feeling desperate and miserable. I know the right thing is to find a way through it with my wife for the sake of my daughter, but honestly I dont think my soul can take it. Any suggestions?",
    "Feeling at the end of the line My wife knows about my rape and thanks to her I was able to talk to my sister about it too, needless to say I broke my sisters heart but also made us closer, she also was kind enough to pay for private professional help for me and her to deal with this, I also opened about this with an uncle my mothers brother who I thought was someone completely different to what he turned out to be, when I told him about the rape he broke hard and I took him to talk with the therapist I was seeing thanks to my sister, and what she told me before the therapist and told to him later changed everything, she said that I needed some sort of compensation for what had happened in order to move on, it wasnt possible to get legal justice due the time frame of the events and the lack of evidence beyond my word and she didnt suggest anything more beyond that we should try to figure it out, of course telling the whole family was my first thought and let the truth have its day, but my uncle mothers brother begged me not to tell anything because it would destroy the family, specially my mother who has a lot, and I mean a lot of love for the uncle who raped me, she my mother basically raised him the first 4 years of his life because his parents had a busy and privileged life and he the rapist is seen by the rest of the family as a great guy and an example, with this he mothers brother convinced me not to tell anything, I know I could have just said no and told everything to everyone but thinking what could I possibly put my mother through after seeing how his brother took the news made me feel trapped and basically Ive been living feeling like a prisoner and the responsible for my entire family being together or not. My dear wife, my love, only she keeps me sane holding me when Im about to broke and unfortunately with all that Ive mentioned before about not being able to get a job it has begun to be a frequent occurrence and I can see it is taking a toll on her, Ive busted my eyes and my back studying and working hard on small jobs non related to my career just to keep us going and whenever seems to be an opportunity all I get are rejections or I get to watch people getting jobs because of political favors, and what has led me here is the thought that I am the common factor in all of this, and everyone specially my wife would be better off if I am no more, we would love to be able to begin a family but it would be so irresponsible to bring a child to this world under this circumstances, and this also makes my wife so sad, she cries in my shoulder but tells me that we will pass this and everything will be fine, but Ive lost almost all hope, and given our age and financial situation it looks that if she keeps being by my side she will never have the family and the life she deserves.",
    "I haven’t been myself since 2020. Will I ever go back to normal or should I just give up on life? I was a straight A college student and part time EMT. Now Im an unemployed college dropout living at my parents house. I gained 40 pounds and stopped enjoying my usual activities. I feel like I go from doctor to doctor and none of them give a shit about any of this. The depression started very suddenly in January of 2021 and its gotten progressively worse ever since then. Things completely spiraled out of control in October because thats when I distanced myself from all of my friends. Ive been on 20mg lexapro for several years and I just switched to trintellix a month ago. But Trintellix makes me feel awful. If anything, Im worse off than I was before. I have slight brain fog constantly. I have emotions again, which is good, but theyre all negative. Im just sad and angry 247. I went to the doctor again today because they said I had minor hypothyroidism the last few times I got blood work done. Hopefully Ill get medicated for that. I just feel powerless. Im like a victim of my own mind. Before this very sudden bout of depression, I was so happy and excited about life. Now its as if I have no future because I cant control my depression and no one is helping me to do so. I havent been myself since 2020. I dont know what to do. Side note I started taking adderall in January and thats when I started getting depressed. Any correlation?",

The confrontation part because they played a huge part in it. I have thought it through seeing it from their perspective and have come to the right conclusion that they share a huge role in it. It is going to get ugly. The thing is if I dont say and make them realise how toxic they have been I will lose the chance to save myself, I get this only chance. Any advice on how to proceed.",

I 35 male was raped as a child by an uncle 7 years my senior, I think I was 8 or 9, the trauma locked my memories from 2 to 3 years between the incident and subsequent years. I didnt confront the issue till I was 24 and a girlfriend that I used to talk to and sort of wanted something more were talking about our feelings and I just plained told her what had happened to me and she told me that something similar happened to her at a similar age, we cried and talked about it and other things, strangely even as we felt closer after this we went our separate ways being just good friends to this day she is married, lives in a different country and has a baby, after that I worked through my trauma alone with little success side note, there is a history of violent tendencies in the men of my family, both from my mothers and fathers side, and Im basically the mixed result.",
    "Why can’t I open up to anyone about the things that unsettle me? I am hoping that someone here can help me with this. I have been sexually assaultedI think that thats the proper term without get into detail by my classmates when I was in sixth grade. I have been so ashamed that I didnt tell anyone about this to this day. And I am still not able to work up enough courage to tell anyone my story. I have been writing with this lady from my countries crisis hotline for about two week and I have told her already some things about myself, but they are all rather superficial. I cant see myself opening up to anyone beyond that very small surface level. When I imagine getting a therapist and talking to them I think that I could tell them maybe a little bit more if they were facing me with their back. Its all just so weird. It probably makes no sense to you, I dont understand it either... Someone I wish that I could talk about everything but there is just a barrier in my head making it hard to even type about stuff.

    "I'm obsessing over a man that doesnt think twice about me. So heres the deal. Ive been involved off and on with this guy for over a year, with a strong falling out ending our friends with benefits the first time. But once we matured and got over it, we started seeing each other again. Ive always had feelings for him, but have kept them at bay. Hes very aware of these feelings because Ive told him. However, he doesnt want ANYTHING more than booty calls and the occasional sleep over. Hes honestly kind of an asshole, but I am so fucking infatuated with him that it scares me. I find myself constantly checking to see if hes read my messages or is online or has posted something. I cant stop thinking about him. I try so hard to keep myself distracted with work or hobbies, but my mind immediately goes right back to him when its all done... What do I do? I want him to show some kind of emotional bond towards me, but I know thats not something I can control. I need help accepting the situation Im in.

    "How am I supposed to get help when no one will listen? Im in my late 20s and life has constantly taken a dump on me, I need to talk to a therapist, everything in life feels meaningless, nothing is fun anymore, and I cant take it. I came really close a few times in the spring to just ending it and realized I needed to get help. Talking with my friends didnt help, which is fair, theyre not professionals, but when I talked to my doctor he also kinda brushed off my concerns and gave me a referral to a therapist. I tried calling their offices multiple times but no one answered the phone or replied to the messages I left. Tried again with a different therapist but the same thing happened. I know my phone works and at this point I feel like the universe is just trying to tell me to kill myself, the only reason I havent is because I dont want to make my friends and family sad. What should I do here? I feel like trying again is just going to lead to failure and make feel worse, again. I wrote a few paragraphs about my situation but cut out all but the most relevant stuff, I can provide more info if needed, Im really just at a loss and dont know how much longer I can go on when everything seems to keep going wrong and I have so little to be proud of.",

    "Exercising and sadness Hi im new here, last year i tried to end my life around this date and the support equip at the hospital told me to exercise regularly to help with the sadness, since i wasnt diagnosed depression or nothing really, just very sad. This is important becuse no one told me that before. And since then i tried to be more active, got a bike thanks to a job with my aunt and started walking for playing pokemon go again etc. But whenever i stop those activities i feel very low and sad, even if i do it just because im busy, but i have to admit sometimes i feel very lazy and tired to do them. Is there a connection between exercise and feeling happier? Can i find a way to be more excited about doing them alonewith friends? If this post needs another flair i can edit it",
    "I don't know what else to title this... depressed 🤷‍♀️ Just got off the phone with my mom. She said I sounded insane. At first I was talking a mile a minute, then I was crying, then angry. I feel out of wack. Ive had depression before but covid is definitely making it way worse. Im a substitute teacherrecent graduate. I dont have any jobs because teachers have been online where I am so I currently have zero income. I can barely afford to live. I dont have any good friends. My 2 best friends live in another city and they tend to screen my calls. Just out of a selfish lack of desire to talk to me. They have boyfriends and babies so they dont need me like I need them. Ive been so lonely. I was dumped back in November. Thought about dating again over Christmas. Met someone nice but Im so bipolar maybe clinically, Ive had my suspicions right now that Im not even a healthy person to date. One second Im seizing the day, full face of makeup, exercising and ready for a date, the next second Im canceling, crying, laying in bed watching movies and hating myself like an empty shell. Before you say get therapy or look into being diagnosed with bipolar, the reason I dont is 1. Cant afford therapy and 2. Because of everything with covid, being dumped, having no income, having no friends, I truly do think this could just be a situational depression with manic tendencies due to boredom. I dont know what to do though. My mom said go date to make friends  thats not how dating works. Then she told me to move home, well I dont wanna be stuck with my family like a 25 year old loser. I just wish my life was better, I want to be living it instead of crying. Could use some support or advice or even just be listened to since noone else does. Thank you",
    "Depression, procrastination and graduation Hello, thats my first post ever on reddit. I am in huge trouble and I put myself there now I need to face this but I dont know what to do. I always had panic attacks and alot of stress since I was just a child. but when I started university it doubled and I came to the point last year where I couldnt get out of bed, let alone study. I closed myself off and didnt get out of my room for a month, That had consequences on my grades and that made me hate myself even more. I used to be very disciplined, a grade A student so that felt like a punch to the guts. Anyway, this year I have a graduation project I need to work on. I thought I learned from that past experience but I really didnt. I was procrastinating out of fear for 5 months now. whenever I start I just start trembling and cant concentrate on anything Im reading. that led me to withdraw from poeple, my teacher my friends because Im too ashamed of my behaviour and I cant face them. Im in deep shit I want to get out of this but I dont know how. This is not how I thought my life and my view towards myself turn out .

    "I'm not sure how to tell my mother I'm depressed Trigger warning NSFW  there will be mentions of self harm Before anyone jumps to any conclusions please know I love my mother. Shes has an interesting way of handling situations. She just wants best for me and everyone and doesnt know how to handle certain situations. I think the beginning was 7th grade. Its the age when Im told kids around my age go through their adolescent stage. They become defiant of their parents and so forth. Im not sure if this is applicable for everyone but I was one of the kids who defied their parents and acted like a brat. Im certain from grade 7 it was just my teenage phase but now Im not sure because at grade 8 and 9 these mood swings got progressively worse and I began to act more sad than just moody. In grade 9 I ended up going to the office to have a talk with the counselor. Dont shame me for this but I had just began to use social media and my account was small so only my friends knew my account. Maybe it was for the better but I had posted on my story that I was going to ct myself for everyone friend of mine. During this time my family was in the rough. My parents were talking about divorce because they were living apart for too long and their gears just didnt click well together after being apart for too long and just recently getting to live with each other. I dont know what had gotten to me because I probably shouldnt have posted such a sensitive topic but I posted it but didnt completely follow through with it. I did very minor scratches. Maybe I was seeking comfort and attention. Anyways, I had posted it, this concerned my friends and it went all the way to the schools counselor and I ended up having a talk. I just bawled during the counsel meeting and asked if this would get to my parents and the counselor said yes. I didnt want to let my parents know because it would simply add fuel into the fire with my parents constantly talking about divorce. Anyways long story short this got to my parents and things got just a bit messier. My parents fought and mentioned my problems and blamed one another and it was difficult.",

Chronic pain is really bad lately and my doctor is taking forever to get me treatment. My grandma died a few months ago. My dog died 2 months ago... i cant stop crying for her. She was my baby I mean that so much. It hurts so much nonstop. Im facially disfigured and make everyone uncomfortable. No one likes being uncomfortable so they avoid me. Its been a hard life and no one ever wants to know about it. I went thru so much, overcame so much and no one cares. I want a best friend so much. The girl I thought could become this, my old coworker, isnt going to be that for me. Im not mad. But it hurts a lot. I miss her and wish we couldve been closer. I really thought we could be super close best friends. Im so lonely, its like choking. The grief is so much. Insomnia is worst its ever been. Seeing a therapist. On medication. Not suicidal. So dont mention it please. Im so tired of people giving me suicide hotline numbers and saying see a therapist. I feel pushed away when that happens now. Im so tired of being ignored and invisible. I dont know whats so wrong with me for people to not want to be around me. I love life and living. But this is so painful and hard this year. I miss my old job where I was running the show and worked in a dream team with my mentor. Im working on building my own stuff all day everyday. It keeps me busy and my mind off depression.

He even made me feel like I belong. But ever since Ive met him Ive been so much happier. I dont think about hurting myself anymore. The dark thoughts are almost nonexistent.

Ive always liked video games, and always had the thought that not much in the real world really felt worth it or like it would do much for me, but a lot of the time even video games just feel like a distraction. Same with people. I can appreciate a lot of things, but dont really expect them to fill me with much of a sense of joy or something. They say relationships are the biggest predictors of happiness, and even though I love my family I almost dont know if I feel it. I just feel the pain at the thought of losing them or if they lost me. Its like I am only driven by moving away from pain and pleasure is fleeting if at all possible. Until recently I thought I was completely emotionally numb from medication but Im trying to entertain the idea its OCD and depression that makes me like this, because thats more fixable.

    "My life is amazing, but I'm a miserable asshole. I'm not sure what to do. So Ive hit a wall, and I dont really have any support in my life, so I decided to turn to you guys. Kinda weird for this to be my first post, but whatever. And sorry in advance, this is probably going to be a long rant. Like the title says, I live a really great life. Im married to a beautiful woman who loves me more than anything, the sex is amazing, and shes smart and talented and has a great, lucrative job. I just graduated college 12 years later than I had planned, but doesnt matter in a field that Im really passionate about, with plans to apply for grad school. Financially, I dont live in luxury, but Im comfortable. I have an amazing dog. I have a good, supportive family. I live in a safe neighborhood. Im not trying to brag, but just trying to illustrate how from the outside, I really dont have anything to complain about. Im aware of how incredibly lucky I am. But the problem is, Im just miserable all the time, no matter what I do. For a little background, Ive been in therapy for over two decades Im currently 34. For most of that, I was misdiagnosed with clinical depression, bipolar disorder, several anxiety disorders, and given cocktail after cocktail. Two years ago, it turns out it was a misdiagnosis and it was atypical ADD no hyperactivity, just the concentration and motivation issues, and Ive been properly medicated since. Ive had ECT electroshock twice, before the ADD diagnosis. My current therapist is excellent, and tells me that compared to how I was when I first started seeing her almost 9 years ago Im so far beyond where I was that its astounding. I guess what Im saying is, Ive been lucky in that Ive been able to take advantage of mental health resources, and what Im experiencing isnt due to a lack of those. I have been in quite a few abusive relationships romantic and platonic so I know theres some trauma Im still working through.",

    "Scared, lazy, anxious, perfectionism and depression, messed up life I got I hate myself every time theres a opportunity to learn something new, here I am hesitating when to start, staring blankly on the screen, then the worst part procrastinating on memes, funny videos, netflix or even house chores. Challenges I hate that, I envy my friends, always ready to take on new challenges, being the best version of their self and then they reap the rewards of taking the risk, the opposite happens when I face new challenges, panic attack, complaining, whining and thinking negative constantly. My friends are earning near six digits yet me is stuggling to get by on my meager income, most of the time thinking I might get fired on every messed up I did on the office. I always wanna learn to code so I may better my chance of earning more or atleast a self fulling hobby, when theres an opportunity or time to learn I always hesitate on starting maybe because Im scared like a kid who is afraid of math. Coding is painful especially the debugging part but it is very fulfilling once everything run. When I was a kid I love to draw but my parents enrolled me on a engineering course focusing on IT, so there goes my hobby slowly getting forgotten. I envy my friends in college who are quite into technical stuff, I do love tinkering but when it comes to tinkering something about school there goes me, avoiding it or procrastinating on studying. I know a bit of coding stuff but Im not that good on analyzing instruction, algorithm, pseudocode etc. I struggled at school but manage to graduate with not so good grades average, just passing. So theres that my opportunity getting hired is not so good but still manage to get a job Im thankful they still havent fired me at the office, even tho Im the dumbest, cringiest, lowest confidence employee, slow on getting instruction and full of typos on my email and bad at presentationreport I wanna conquer my fear but anxiety is messing up with me.

    "Just found out the girl I’ve speaking to the last 7 years is talking to someone else. Need some advice please. Ive been through hell and back with her, and I value her friendship so much that I can get through all the suffering and pain I have when shes around just so I can spend some time with her, but all she does when she comes over is sit on her phone for hours and just smiles at it. Im an absolulte mess right now. I have a heart condition and the last couple hours I felt like I was having a heart attack from my anxiety attack but thats only because Ive had a couple hours to take in the news. What do I do? We havent spoken in 2 weeks. I actually tried to call her today to see how she was cause we havent spoken and I did not receive a reply. Do I bring it up to her? I know shes just gonna lie to me and tell me she isnt talking to anyone. Do I just delete her out of my life? Im so lost and confused. Its a 14 year friendship and my only true friend and I dont want to lose it, but I dont think I can ever look at her the same or talk to her for at least a long time because she knew that me finding out would hurt me. I even told her Id rather hear it from her rather than anyone else because itll hurt less, and she always says to me if I ever found out she was talking g to someone she knows I would kill myself. Id love to get some advice on what to do, because I dont have anybody to talk to about my problems other than her, but unfortunately this is about her. I understand that none of this is her fault because you cant control your feelings. But Im upset at the fact that she hid this from me, and apparently saw him and made out with him before she came over to my house for my birthday a few weeks ago. TLDR in love with my best friend. She doesnt have feelings for me. She hid the fact shes been speaking to a guy which really hurt me cause I told her if she ever was to tell me because it would hurt less. She knows about my feelings and I know she doesnt have feelings for me.",

I wouldnt be able to apply for another year.... I almost made it. But I was unspooling too fast. I ended up leaving that job before I could get the help I needed. But that was fine, I had enough savings to get me through a month or two, I could find a new job. That was, I dont even know, three months ago? I havent even applied. I just...cant find the energy. I know I need help, I know Im really sick, but I just...cant move. Ive had the website for a local therapist open in my tabs the whole time one that I can email, because holy hell phonecalls are an anxiety nightmare even when Im feeling sane but everytime I go to reach out I just get paralyzed by anxiety and uncertainty, and I just cant find the will to muster through it. I havent gone back to selfharming but Im so afraid of ending up back in that place again, its been a struggle. I just dont know what else to do. I just dont know what I CAN do?!

    "Is there anything that could help with the numbness part of depression ? Depression manifests as a variety of symptoms such as fatigue, insomnia, loss of energy, anxiety ,negative thinking, emotional numbness, loss of motivation...etc So far I found many ways to manage the symptoms of depression but I didnt find anything that helped with the numbness part where you just dont feel anything or care about anything at all nothing makes you happy, sad, cry, your mood is just flat all the time I wasnt always like this I was a normal person with hobbies, ambitions and goals but I developed this condition this year and it stripped me of everything. I lost all feelings for my gf I lost all drive for my dreams, they mattered nothing. I had a blank mind I couldnt socialize I kinda stopped contacts with family and friends basically I lost everything that made meaning in my life. Its impossiblemeaningless to live in this condition. The numbness part is so common with clinical depression  not depression feeling because of a bad day  and I saw many posts on reddit that I could relate with so I know that Im not alone suffering from this condition so anyone has this symptom found anything that could help with it ?",

Im just sitting here lifelessly scrolling through reddit doing nothing productive whatsoever. I even went for a very long walk today, I drank something, I ate something but no difference.

    "I don’t want to go swimming at the lake tonight..... But it seems like Ive been crying out for help from every point Ive tried to make, and no one is interested in helping me the way Ive asked. gtgtForget veterans employment allocation program gtgtForget educationemployment pipelines gtgtForget Criminalizing American Political Discrimination. I just wanted to become a fucking professional opera singer, and I wanted help from others making that a reality, after 20 years of working towards it alone werent doing anything to make it a reality. And it seems like nobody cares if it kills me that no matter how hard Ive tried to achieve that goal, Ive always come up short on my own, while everybody else makes themselves a part of these segregating communities against me. So tonight Im contemplating wether I ought to swim out into the middle of the lake and end it all. Nobody wants to help me when Ive asked for help. Nobody wants to implement alternative solutions when Ive tried to present them to people. Nobody wants to even touch me, let alone care if Im on the cusp of deciding to end my life. I dont want to go swimming at the lake tonight. But it seems like nobody wants to stop me because they care. They only want to stop me to save face, and I cant pull myself back when they want to stop me for reasons as selfish as why I want to end my life tonight. So why should I stop for their benefit when they wont help me for mine?",
    "depression is getting worse this is kind of just rambling but ive been depressed for literally as long as i can remember and i cant take it anymore. everyday just feels like a chore to get through. when i meet new people theyre supportive at first but over time they just get annoyed bc it never goes away and they end up leaving, so ive just taken to not venting to friends bc its only ever made things worse. growing up i was a smart kid and now ive failed out of college multiple times and am in extreme debt because of it. im stuck living with my parents and all i want is to move out but i cant hold down a job. ive tried every antidepressant available to me as well as multiple kinds of therapy, TMS, partial programs and inpatient. nothing helps. i dont want to die i just want to be happy but it feels like theres nowhere to turn. i love life and i love people, the only reason i dont end everything is because i know how much it would hurt people in my life. i just want to be able to experience happiness and not be so tired everyday and constantly overwhelmed with thoughts of hurting myself. i try so hard every single day to get better and it only gets worse. ive called or texted hotlines in the past but it just made me suicidal because it just makes it more obvious theres nothing that can be done. i think if the coronavirus wasnt going on id probably admit myself to inpatient but that doesnt really seem possible right now. plus when ive gone to inpatient in the past they havent really helped me, i barely even got therapy they just made sure i didnt kill myself but didnt do anything to make those thoughts go away. im in so much pain. i dont know what else to do.",

    "I ( 26 female ) have decided to take care of my severely depressed younger brother (20m ) by letting him move in with me last week and need some tips. He is 20, however never grew up or matured properly due to lack of socialization... Never experience love, only had friends before his teens and made virtual friends via his gaming on Xbox until this day... While my mom drank and my dad was aggressive all these years, my brother would go hide in his room gaming all night and sleping all day and hasnt left his room until child protective services took him out for 1.5 years. And they only did because I told them what was going on... Anyways. Fast forward and now he is finally with me. I want to be the best support but I havent stopped feeling anxiety since he moved in. Like I am not eating as well and I am worried this will make me feel isolated or ruin my other relationships  dont have many left haha but 23 but also worried for him too as he wont eat unless I tell him to, wont move his body unless I tell him to etc... Having him here reminds me of the misery of my parents and my childhood. Because he is unfortunately the result of a dysfunctional family. I dont want to turn into my mom where I cook and clean all the time  she is a functioning alcoholic but gets highly abusive when she drinks but still cooked and cleaned  even though I cooked for.myself growing up as Im vegan and she didnt want to cook vegan food for me when I turned 19. I want my brother to feel confident but he doesnt because he dropped out of highschool twice as a result of mental illness growing up. Before coming to stay with me he was starring to refuse food and had severe psychomotor retardation  cant get our of bed  and like I maybe mentioned before he has not gotten out of bed in a decade expect for when CPS got involved . I booked him an appointment with a family doctor on Friday  tomorrow  and I spoke to my own therapist who recommended me a program to recommend to the doctor for my brother.",

    "I am nothing anymore So I have been depressed all of my life as long as I can remember. I didnt really know what its like to not have that sinking, dreadful feeling in my heart. That is until I met my current boyfriend. He makes me feel alive and happy again. He pulled me out of the darkness I was so deep in. But I can feel myself starting to slip again, and Im trying so hard to not let it drag me down. I used to self harm, and I promised him Id try as hard as I could to not do it again. For like 3 weeks before the present one, I was completely absolutely numb. I didnt laugh, didnt cry, didnt feel anything at all. It was the worst feeling in my life, It felt like I just died and had no soul or heartbeat, but worse. It was terrifying, and I never want to go through it again. But after about three weeks of feeling that way, I selfharmed, partially to prove I could still feel something. And for some reason, I didnt feel the sadness I usually do when I relapse. I just felt alive. And I slipped out of that terrible numb feeling. I feel alive now, and still numb, but not as bad as before. But the problem is, Ive slipped into a different type of numbness. Its like I dont care about anything anymore. I have 3 grades below a 50, and I really dont have the energy or motivation to care, even though I want to. I honestly wouldnt care If i just got hit by a truck or like had a heart attack, but its not like im gonna go out of my way to make it happen. I want to stop this before it slips too deep but I dont know how.",
    "What if I don't want to try to get better anymore? I have been depressed for a long time. From that time there was always at least one constant in treatment, I had to try in order to get better. Once upon a time, maybe I could have done something, but everything Ive had has wasted away. I cant make myself care about anything anymore, let alone myself. What am I supposed to do when I have completely thrown in the towel on life. What am I supposed to do then?",
    "I'm really depressed and I want to get help but I don't know what to do I have always known I was a little depressed, but once the pandemic hit all of the things I did to keep myself normal disappeared and I spiraled out of control. I got dismissed from my school a few months ago because I failed all of my classes for both 2020 semesters and most days dont get out of bed. I have done absolutely nothing productive since getting dismissed because every time I try I get really emotional about the dismissal. I am really scared to go to the dentist because I know I havent been taking care of my teeth. It is a minor miracle if I shower more than once a week. I feel like life is just passing me by, every day I wake up and then blink and Ive spent the past 12 hours in bed and I didnt accomplish anything. All of my friends are extremely accomplished people with jobs or internships lined up and I have literally nothing because I cant get myself to DO anything. Im too ashamed to reach out to them about it, I also just feel like they wouldnt understand or have any helpful advice. I know comparison is the thief of joy but I cannot help it. I dont want to get into the details but I am also trying to process some traumatic things that happened to me in the past few years and some days I have are just dark. I am not suicidal but I do have some intrusive thoughts about suicide occasionally which are starting to become more frequent. I am turning 25 soon and I want to get help before I get kicked off of my parents insurance. But I dont know anything about what to do. Do I get a therapist? Psychiatrist? Or something else? How do I find one and how do I pick the right one? I had a bad experience with a therapist when I was younger which has put me off of this until now  Are there other steps I should be taking? I dont even know what to do, I just know I cant live like this anymore. Asking my parents for help directly about this is also not an option for me, at least not yet, which is also why Im posting here. Thanks for reading.",

I can understand how she feels about it, but its gotten to the point where she just ignores me when Im sad. I dont even feel like I can cry to her and tell her how Im feeling without ending up just leaving the room because Im afraid Ill make her uncomfortable or that shes get upset at me for just being sad.

Im tired of thinking of exercise as a mere chore. Im tired that I cant enjoy food anymore, and the fact that my mom cooks so much doesnt help. My family all says Im lean and normal but I feel so disfigured. My shoulders are too broad and my arms are flappy making me look twice my size, my thighs are gigantic and are covered with cellulite. I really hate my mirrors and if I could break them I would. My weight is always in the middle of normal or overweight and one slice of cake could tip it off.

    "Letting my boyfriend commit suicide. Please help. When I think about him being dead I get so many instrusive thoughts about him not being okay if there is an afterlife  that hes lonely, scared, or in more pain that he was here. As illogical as it may be, I think about how he might be scared, experiencing regret, or in pain in his last moments  I think about how that will lie with him forever and hell never get to know that he is finally okay. I know it probably sounds extremely dumb. He says hes not scared of death, and that helps me slightly. Im in so much pain now, and Im scared of how much pain is to come. I think about the moment I find out that hes dead and how Ill just want to scream at the top of my lungs. Ive been suicidal myself for years now and I think this is what will push me over the edge. Im scared of that. I love him. Hes my best friend, and I wanted to spend my life with him. Hes lying in the other room right now, and I dont know how to manage when the day comes where I can no longer go and lie next to him and give him a cuddle. Im terrified if forgetting him. Im trying to make mental notes of his features, and smells, and little things he does. Unfortunately, derealization has made my memory very poor. Were long distance, and have had very little time together in person. Im from the US and hes from the UK. I dont think Ill be able to attend his funeral because I wont be able to afford to travel, and covid might not allow it anyway. Im not sure Ill ever be able to step foot in the UK again. About him Hes mid 30s. Hes been on disability his entire adult life. Being dependent on the government for money and housing is one reason he feels hopeless. He believes hes locked out of ever getting a decent job now and doesnt think hed be able to cope with one anyway. He doesnt like his living situation. Hes very pessimistic and misanthropic. He thinks he may be in the autism spectrum.",

I am devastated, Ive gone between crying, sobbing, sleeping, and thinking how to kill myself. I just never want to feel like this again, I dont want anyone to be able to hurt me. I dont do well socializing because Im afraid if I open up people wont accept me or are going to hurt me. He was the only one I thought I could trust. Hes left it open to being friends, but all I can think about is how hes not mine anymore and Ill never be able to kiss or hug him the same way again. I was desperate and talked to him today because I felt like I needed him, it didnt turn out well. Other than him and his friends I dont have a lot of friends.

I want the power to love, I am a Roman Catholic and every night and morning I pray, read the Bible and ask to God to give me the power to be happy and give me the gift of love and hope, to remove my extreme anxiety, I want to receive true love but I also want to give true love, I have been assisting to some masses in the Church near my university and I have cried when the priest meditates some passages I can identify with or gives us the command to offer each other the sign of peace because its the only thing that I feel that loves me. The only thing that keeps me going is that I know I am in my most critical moment and when things start to get better or I am at my peak in life I want to be able to look back to these moments and say wow, that was really my lowest point to never repeat it again.

    "I don’t know what’s going on They cant understand what Im going through. Before this covid 19 shit, everyday I go to school I just see everyone in their groups talking and smiling. And I dont know, for 3 months I really havent felt like Ive been a part of a group, man. I dont feel like anyone out there is gonna give me the support. The last relationship I was in, I thought I fell in love with her, and she said she loved me too. But I always fought with her. I realize now that it was just me trying to push her away, because I was scared of her leaving, so I tried to push her away subconsciously because I was scared that she would break my heart and so i just wanted to have an excuse to break it off first before she could have a chance to hurt me. And I kept telling her to leave, but she said that she wasnt gonna go anywhere because I was worth it. And slowly I started feeling at ease. But then we broke up. We had a huge fight about her not putting me first, her best friend getting in the way. I said I would choose my dreams over her, but I also said I didnt want to lose her. And then she said I lost her already. And we broke it off. She said that she would stay. She said she would stay and figure it out. But she didnt. I guess she just couldnt take it anymore. Everyone tells me theyre going to be there for me, but when I need them the most they arent there. Its hard for me to trust. Sophomore year, second semester, I lost faith in everyone. My best friends left me. I felt so alone. I hovered around different friend groups but I still felt alone. I was bedridden for a time. I think I buried it deep down , because I dont remember much about that year except how I had the worst season in soccer of my life and that I wanted to die. I didnt see a reason for living, and I hated everyone. And then that summer I got my shit together, started training for soccer,and I thought I healed.",
    "I don’t know what’s going on I was always the guy that never thought he would get depression you know. Honestly me even saying that I have depression makes me feel like less of a man, it makes me feel like one of those emo and edgy kids from school pretending to be depressed and in their feelings. Everytime I felt sadness or lonely I just take a break and go to sleep or just get back on the grind and try to push through it. But I dont know, lately its gotten so much worse. Two weeks ago for a whole week straight I had insomnia, and Ive been feeling lost, unmotivated, frustrated, anxious with everything. My life is falling apart because Ive been being unmotivated to do anything. And back then If I ever felt unmotivated I always thought that it was just a lack of discipline to do the things I dream and strive for. But lately its been different. Ive been in my feelings every night, and I sleep for more than 10 Hours daily. Im always tired, I feel lethargic, unmotivated, and I need help. I looked up what the things Ive been feeling could mean, and the Internet keeps suggesting I have depression. But I dont feel overwhelmingly sad, I just feel overwhelmed, stressed out all the time, my body doesnt just want to do anything. My Mind just wants to take a day off. I just wanna give up on life. No I dont want to die, but I cant bring myself to try anything anymore. I want to make D1 Soccer in college, but I just dont feel like it anymore to practice and train and so I deteriorate in skill and fitness. I guess this is Karma because someone told me a while back they were feeling the things Im feeling now and I just told them to step up and be a man, and kind of just disregarded the Possibility of them actually being depressed. Even then, I used to have a friend who was depressed and I told her to just stop being depressed and own up to her actions and feelings, I told her it was just a lack of strength and that she just lacked discipline. But I guess now I understand. And I hate it.",

This disgusts me! What can I say please I want my response to be strong enough to be effective!

    "Is it worth trying more anti-depressants? Hey everyone, My depression has been out of control over the last year. Its always been bad, but this was the first year where I woke up nearly every day thinking about suicide. Ive been seeing a therapist for more than a decade and over that time Ive been talked into antidepressants several times. And without fail none of them helped. Prozac, Solexia, Welbutrin, and another Im blanking on all had no positive effect and untenable sexual side effects. This past year I tried Effexor and had to quit after a month or so because it made me feel emotionally numb and I felt no fear or concern about my growing desire to end my life. Now Im very apprehensive about even trying another SSRISNRI As of a few days ago I made one last try at maybe getting the Spravato treatment. But because I live in the worlds richest third world countrythe U. S., all of my prior SSRI experiences mean nothing. The insurance company requires that I endure at least 3 immediate attempts with drugs they want to cover before they even consider honoring the insurance that I pay them for. Has anyone similarly developed this apprehension towards antidepressants and eventually found one that worked? I was given a list of more modern SNRIs and Im fucking terrified that theyll make me feel like he last one and Ill give in and do it.",
    "I’m 23, highly anxious, depressed, raised by a narcissist/alcoholic, and need a job. I have no clue what to do with myself. Until Covid I worked in retailrestaurants my whole life as I am extremely personable, albeit an introvert. Now with covid, I very much so do not trust Americans wholeheartedly, Im getting the vaccine but everything is opening up at 100 no restrictions near me, which just makes no sense to me. Poor behavior amongst people these days, retail workers are the frontline of managing Covid and policies these days, for little pay. Now I dont even want these jobs as Ive not been social for over a year now. I did not go to college as I have learning disabilities. I also have awful fine motor skills, likely due to growing up anxious a lot due to alcohol in the house.

I also am sorta addicted to weed, as I believe I have PTSD at this point so I truly feel its a need not a want at this point which is frustrating. I could go on and on lol, so, help?

Its been a long time since something good happened. Nowadays all i think is for whom i should live or for what? Im trying to find some reason to live but i cant.",
    "I want to be happy Ive bern depressed for almost a decade now. I feel like my life is going nowhere, I always feel like shit, my mind is filled with negative thoughts all the time. I feel like naturally im a happy go lucky, hard working, fun, logical woman. Ive been like that before, and people tell me I am. But my depression makes me feel lazy, unmotivated, grouchy etc. I see a therapist, it helped at first now it doesnt. I refuse to go on medication for a lot of reasons... so how else do I become better??? I feel like im at the end of the road here and i read recently that depression never goes away, you just learn to deal with it. so now I feel even more hopeless. Any tips or advice are appreciated.",
    "First break up So ive scrolled on here for a bit and it seems like everyone is really nice... so here goes nothing This is my first break up but very weird ending. Ended with us both crying and and saying we loved eachother but the timing just wasnt right. He kept thinking about a toxic ex that he just couldnt get over even if in every way our relationship was healthier.his depression is a bit more severe than mine, but i would feed off his too0 much as well witch was bad too. I honestly dont know what im doing here....i guess i just want my story hear even though its rather insignificant and dumb haha. But i feel different now this is a different kinda of depression, i feel more just empty rather than hating myself or wanting to hurt myself. I dont really know how to cope with it. Like is this just how you feel after a break up and it passes or like do i just feel empty now...? Yes he was my first in practically everyhing we did over all but i cant help to feel it was all fake... he said he would think abouy her when we were together thats when i knew his depression was bad because he would just stop everything, caring, talking to me, all attention would stop it like would mental fuck me up. Like when he would do that it was a never endint cycle in my head like okay what wrong how do i help or just support,what if its me? Can i be nicer? Can i be sexier? And i ugly yo look at? Is he thinking of her? Etc. And it would every single time come down to him just randomly missing her. Like even right now it still fucks me up when did he think of her? When i was my happiest? Like it just all crumbles in to lies for me. Or im over thinking this whole thing and should stop thinging of it but its hard lol. I dont know maybe im in the wrong post but just advice, help on my depression how to cope with my body image cause i think im gross.i really dont know",
    "Dealing with my first breakup / not going well My M21 first girlfriend F18 broke up with me 2 months ago after a 4 month relationship. I know it isnt that long, but we moved kind of fast and had high hopes form the beginning it was both of ours first relationship. She wanted to stay a virgin till marriage and we same the same religious values, which I loved and respected so much which I think is part of the reason its so hard on me. But we did have some differences, yet I still tried to imagine a future with her even though I was never 100 sure. 2 months later, and Im dealing with it terribly. I keep imagining a future with her, constantly think about her, mope about it, bring it up with others to the point where I think I annoy them, and I seeing counseling for advice and to find out if I might have social anxiety andor depression. Its just been so hard and Im trying all of the advice that everyone is giving me, but she is the only thing on my mind and I debate on whether or not I was just in it for the relationship or her. At first I didnt know, but I really did love her, and still do. Some of my other friends are also going on dates and have girlfriends so I keep comparing it with them and wonder how they do it. Im just in a rough spot and somedays I just want to end it. Thanks to anyone who listened or comments. ampx200B Edit she broke it off because she is transferring and switching majors, so its bringing a lot of stress into her life and doesnt feel like she has time for a relationship, and was starting to think because of that that we seem to have different futures in mind. Although now I am rethinking my entire future since she said that, and I didnt really know 100 what my future looked like, just that I wanted her in it.",
    "Thought I would share this here Hi, my name is Sebastian and I really dont know how to start this post, maybe because Im afraid to be called whiny or whatever, but the truth is Ive been feeling pretty down recently so I thought I would share what Ive been feelingthinking this past 3 months or so. It is a well known fact that 2020 has been nothing short of horrible, but the reality is that, for me at least , it didnt start that way. Beginning of 2020 was maybe the best Ive ever felt in my life. To provide a little more context, Im 19 rn, but back at January February I was still 18 and about to graduate from high school which I eventually did, with good grades, but heres the issue I graduated from a international German school which educates based on the German system Abitur which in short were some difficult exams that I studied my ass of to pass. Abitur also presented me with the possibility of going abroad for college. All my short life Ive felt kinda pressured to go abroad to study, since my father did it and always talked about how amazing it was, and my school was filled with posters of study in Europemostly Germany its a life changing experience. And so I felt on top of my game and started among at the very top architecture in such places like Madrid,Berlin,Stuttgart,etc but most of all I wanted Barcelona because it felt so perfect on paper, like the best of the best , world wide known, top level technology, state of the art campus, and of course the city itself is an architectural delight arguably the most famous architect , Gaudí is from Barcelona. Looking back now, I was naive and didnt appreciate what I had back home , but I had to prove the ones who bullied and looked down on me back in my school days , that I was better than them, and that was my first of many mistake I went there looking for revenge so to speak. Then everything developed so quickly I had barely any time to think , to my awe I got accepted in BarcelonaTech, I found a nice little bedroom on a student housing that was just beside Campus and I started preparing for my departure , which was going to be mid September bc the University had arranged some introdution activities for new comers. It all seemed perfect, like it was made FOR me.",
    "19 years old and its pretty obvious there's no reason to go any further Id rather live in the wild foraging for food like a monkey over working my ass off for hours a day just for money green paper that people think is so good and meaningful I just dont understand. It feels like I was born on the wrong planet or the wrong time and to make it all worse no matter how long I sit and logically think about it I cannot think of way out of this hell other than suicide, just selling my timelife away as a slave, or just being homeless. And to top it all off when I was 13 or 14 my hair started thinning and during high school with my thin hair everyone Including every single person close to me even teachers started making fun of me saying things like crackhead or you look like an old man, you look like a hobo, Looks like Albert Einstein, Do you wash your hair? and while it sounds hilarious from an outside perspective eventually after hearing dozens of different people say this constantly my entire juniorsenior year it has really dragged me through hell and back just trying to keep myself from going completely insane and it caused me to completely lose any self confidence I once had. All that I really want is a female to love me and a place of my own to stay at without having to owe other people anything. Just me and a lover free to be ourselves to do what we want, live how we want but theres always someone else who thinks its in their place for you to owe them money and money is whats completely ruined my idea of a happy life. Its literally unfair for someone else to tell me how to live but the government thinks they can tell people weed is illegal to possess yet thats fake as fuck like nothing is illegal if it was then some nonhuman force would seek redemption for me possessing weed but no, its other people telling ME that Ill be punished by other human beings if I have weed by throwing me in a cage for doing something of my own consent. or insert anything illegal that I choose to have in my life Does the government have consent of MY BODY? Yes they do if they can throw me in a cage for ingesting something of my choosing. Is living as a truly independent human just completely impossible? To live without being under someone elses rule?",
    "Please give me some advice. I really need it. Hi! This is my first time talking about my problems online so I will write a lot. If you stay to read everything, thank you, I appreciate it, because I really need it. So, I am almost 17 and I have depression since back in secondary school. I am always isolated by my colleagues, who only use me when they need to. Even so, I am always there for them although not the other way around. In my country being selfish is in power, but my parents raised me to be kind and modest so its pretty hard for me to find any friend. Besides that, my parents treat me very badly, always yelling at me or punishing me out of nothing, sometimes pretending I dont even exist. They dont believe me even if I tell the truth and dont ever encourage me. Because of that i became shy and introverted. The only friend I had , who started talking to me two years ago, becaming my bestfriend and also my first love later, changed completely when she got into highschool, got a boyfriend and threw me aside even if I told her about my depression and she knew I really needed her. Now I am alone and I got used to it, but I need someone be there for me and my loneliness only makes me feel more depressed. I always avoid going out with my parents because I feel like shit with them but I hate myself for it and their disappointed looks break my heart. The only way to escape from reality is my phone, but I started using it too often, watching night after night anime even if I have severe myopia. I constantly feel tired, I have no motivation to do anything, I dont seem to be able to love someone anymore and I really cant see myself in the future. The reason I write this is because today I had a nightmare with that girl and when I woke up my chest was hurting so bad and I screwed up with my parents. If anyone has come so far, thanks again, and sorry about my bad English. I really need some advice  What should i do? How can I escape this?",
    "My uncle is getting severely depressed, how to help him. So my uncle recently unfriended a toxic friend who drained him off his money, convinced him to unfriend all of his friends and introduced him to alcohol and drugs but after he unfriended him he became really lonely and started getting intoxicated even more, almost stopped going to his job and talking really pessimistic like wanting to kill himself and what is the use of living anymore. I dont know how to help him, whether to seek professional help or to do something else. I am really sad and in pain from seeing him spoil his life and health like this. He roams around wearing the same shirt and not even admitting he is depressed. A little advice would be much appreciated.",
    "I hate how bad I am at art, but I don't know what to do about it. Hi, so Im an amateur artist like REALLY amateur, my art skills suck and despite trying for over a decade I cant seem to improve. Art has always been a passion of mine, as well as something I genuinely enjoy doing on the extremely rare occasion that I manage to produce a slightlylesssthanusual drawing at least so feeling like my art is stuck at the subdeviantart level has made me incredibly frustrated and is probably the leading contributor to my depression. Its getting to the point that Im beginning to wonder if I should force myself to avoid art in general just to keep the selfhatred at bay. The problem is that I dont know WTF Im supposed to do about it. I tried to ignore it for a couple years, tried to tell myself art was just a phase and I wasnt into it anymore, but that didnt work. Ive tried multiple methods of improvement Ive taken both private instruction and community college classes, but I seem to have terrible luck as theyve all been pretty crap. I feel like Ive exhausted all of my options. I havent tried online classes, but judging by the reviews Ive read for places like Udemy and Skillshare I doubt theyd be any better. Ive tried looking for tips online, but all I get is basically the artist equivalent of git gud. It seems like the only option I have left is just practice nonstop for the 20 years and hope I magically improve Saitamastyle. Unfortunately, I just dont think I can do that. Ive had so many setbacks and failures in my life that I genuinely dont think I have the patience to wait until Im in my mid40s before Im halfway decent at drawing. Even worse, the fact that Im colorblind and extremely nearsighted as well as lacking whatever Matrixvision lets you visualize an object as brush strokes and color values makes me wonder if practice would even do me any good at all. Anyways, Ive rambled too much. TLDR  I suck at art, I dont know how to not suck at art, and this makes me really fing depressed.",
    "Struggling a bit, anyone have any tips? It's been bothering me more and more and it hurts. So, Ive been feeling bad about my weight recently. I want to lose weight but its really hard for me to eat less because my dad never thinks I eat enough. Im not in control of what I eat right now either since I live with my parents still. My weight didnt used to bother me so much but Ive been having break downs because of it at times. The break downs havent been to the point where Im hurting myself again but I want to. I never will hurt myself again, I made a promise I wouldnt and I never break my promises. But sometimes I want to because I hate the way I look as it is and Ive never felt pretty either. It didnt used to matter as much and I think if I lost the unnecessary weight Id feel better about myself. Does anyone have any tips on how I can lose weight? I work a lot everyday at a barn but for some reason it hasnt been enough for me. I guess because I cant eat the amounts I should. Im not obese or anything but its annoying and uncomfortable.

Yesterday when our son went to work his car was making noises like the battery was messed up or he needs a new alternator  he loves cars so he knows what the sounds mean lol I think my husband got defensive about it and was like well I didnt do it  my husband has totally messed up every single car weve owned and totaled my sons other car right before we moved and he doesnt take any responsibility for any of it its always someone elses fault or he says sorry and its never to be spoken of again thats been our whole relationship Anyway sorry my son came to me yesterday and was like why does dad make me feel like every time I wanna do something for myself Im lazy or Im not responsible enough. I told him I was sorry and I didnt know but maybe it was because my son is more responsible than my husband has EVER been ! Then my son tells me and this isnt the first time that hes afraid to move out because hes worried my husband will get us in another fucking money bind and hes worried about his sisters. My heart doesnt know what to feel I feel soooo bad that he feels he has to be responsible for his sisters cause he knows his dads gonna fuck something up. Im trying to find a job but its always been the same all but one time when he was talking to another girl saying I was holding him back cleaning houses and I was a loser. After that time its always been well I make more money than you so you have to quit, like now we moved and I was supposed to get a job but I cant he has my car to go to work.

    "I think my boyfriend left me due to his depression and I need some help to understand and deal with this situation. tldr at the bottom Although I have more than enough mental problems on my own, depression probably isnt one of them. But it is the problem of my now exboyfriend. He isnt someone who talks much and I really tried to talk to him but its hard to get any real information from him and although he seems to try to answer me, most times the answer is some variation of I dont know. So I thought Id ask you guys if anything in my story sounds relatable to you and if you have any idea about the situation of my ex and can maybe explain the things he cant Of course I know that you can just make guesses but Im trying really hard to understand him and Im just so confused. We both have our own problems but as a couple I wouldnt say we had any major problems. In the last months his depression got worse and I tried to support him but more often than not he prefers to be alone when hes feeling very bad and then I just try to give him enough space. Thats why were not as close as I would have liked but this slowly improved over time, so I was patient. We didnt see each other for a month due to badly timed holidays and when I came back, he broke up with me. His reasoning was something along the lines that he thinks Im feeling more for him than vice versa and that our relationship was more like a friendship. Which I think is true and at the same time isnt... Its definitely not just a friendship, but because I tried to not put any pressure on him and let things be more casual at times, we werent already there where I would like my relationship to be. That was two months ago. Were still texting each day and sometimes meet  were not having sex or kissing but still, he doesnt treat me just like a friend and it seems like he doesnt want to. Were officially broken up... but were not just friends.",

    "Can depression make you feel like you lost feelings for your partner? I was dating my bf for 1.5 years and both of us were deeply and truly in love with each other. I could tell. He suddenly said he lost feelings because of his depression and he tried to get them back but it never felt the same as it did before. Is it his depression that is making him feel this way or is it reality? He said that he doesnt know how long it will take to fix himself and he doesnt want me to wait for him because it isnt fair for me. I love him and Im willing to wait because his parents are the reason for his depression. When he moves out he will def feel that baggage left from his mind. He even hates them and is upset that he has to stay with them the whole summer before college. He even got drunk with alcohol because of his depression. And he never did this before. Do you think he actually lost feelings or that his feelings are being concealed because of the severe depression? He said he did love me before and a part of him still loves me now. But then Im confused because he told me to move on because its not fair for me to wait. Like i really love him and thats why im willing to wait. And he even said he doesnt know about later when he moves out because he feels like he cannot be fixed at all. He said he is depressed to the point where nobody can fix him. He sounded extremely depressed which made me hurt because I wanted to see him happy.",

So last night me and one of my buddies, who I am very close to, had a discussion on whats been going on in my head. Lately I have been feeling super sad and borderline suicidal because I have been focusing on my childhood and have come to the realization that I had an abusive childhood. My abuse was mostly psychological and verbal, but it still hurt and I can still feel it to this day. Anyways, last night me and my buddy were discussing how my childhood was abusive and how I try to reach out to others particularly women for comfort, because I feel that I was denied affection by my mother while growing up. All through the conversation, it didnt feel like I was connecting with my friend, only my internal emotions and sorrow. It felt like the mini therapy session we were having was doing little. After leaving I felt hollow on the inside. It lasted till about noon this morning. Felt completely worthless and useless. I was wondering if anyone had tips for what to do when feeling hollow and how to better connect to people.",
    "Questions about taking Wellbutrin XL 150 mg, about 72 hours before I start In 48 to 72 hours, I will begin taking Wellbutrin XL 150 mg once a day, which will be my first time taking a pharmaceutical medicine for anxiety and depression, after my twelvestep program sponsor encouraged me to do so, and after my mother  a psychiatric nurse encouraged me to do so. I have a robust support system, and for over seven years, I have regularly engaged in a myriad of modalities to address anxiety, depression, and hopelessness, and a pattern of burnout, including but not limited to cognitive behavioral therapy, two twelvestep programs, different forms of meditation, various mindfulness practices, hatha yoga, bhakti yoga, weightlifting, highintensity interval training, longdistance running, reading books on personal development and introspection, different forms of journaling, a myriad of support groups, numerous supplements, psychedelics, etc. As one of my hatha yoga instructors has stated, I do all the things. I have chosen to take Wellbutrin XL 150 mg for many reasons. It seems to have minimal side effects in most people based on my research and conversations with my psychiatrist and other doctors, it does not lead to some of the side effects that I am most concerned about, like weight gain, and it seems to be a manageable introduction to psychiatric medicine. Moreover, all of the previouslymentioned modalities have changed my life for the better since 2014. Still, a destructive and potentially lifethreatening pattern comes up in my life, time and time again, and my psychiatrist, my mother, and others believe that Wellbutrin XL 150 mg may help.",

Hello everyone, I think about myself as an old child, unable to launch. Even though I started my own company, and began developing wordpress based websites, I havent earned much my whole life. I feel like a total st. For about a month Ive met a girl in a nearby city, who is 5 years older than me. She has a stable job with a much better income than mine, but she pays for rent and says that she cant save any money. Both of us are the only children our parents have. She wants a child soon, so she is looking for commitment, but on the other way, she says that she is not willing to limit any of my freedom. I was through a couple of bad relationships and I am not into hooking up randomly and not even dating anymore. I am very very frustrated and I dont know what should I do. Should I leave my parents, even if they need my help from time to time, take the nothing that I have and move with her? I am not confident, my schedule is a mess, I have a big problem waking up in the morning and I have no idea what to do. I sometimes wonder if I am semiretarded, or having some autistic spectrum disorder. I had problems with weed and alcohol and I incline towards addiction most of the time.

Lately I noticed that I have been thinking about it more often though. I am saying this because I dont even know if things are actually getting worse. I cant even allow myself to feel bad because I dont really know if Im supposed to feel bad. Im trying to justify why I think that things are getting worse by saying that I think about suicide more often. I dont really know what Im feeling. Im feeling something but I dont know what it is or whether or not Im supposed to feel it. But I guess I can say that Im feeling pretty hopeless. I did Becks Depression Inventory and it seems like I have moderate depression. Which is not a new thing for me, Ive had depression for the last 67 years. Im 23 btw. I used a lot of medications, I also went to therapy for about 78 months. I cant go to therapy anymore because I dont have the money for it. I cant ask for money from my parents because they need to support my sister who is going to go to uni. There are no free therapists around either. I also dont know if I should go to therapy. Am I being selfish? Am I indulging in my thoughts and feelings too much? Other people have problems too, and I would be lying if I said that I have it worse than most people. I also failed at school. In 6 years I was only able to finish the first years classes. I am... lazy. Irresponsible. In the past and maybe even right now, I have acted without thinking about others. My parents worked hard to make sure I can get education. I am ashamed of myself for not doing what I needed to do. I am also ashamed of lying to them about my school.

My repressed anger, my failed, awkward attempt at love, my feelings of hopelessness, but like I said, theres so much I cant even keep track of it,like my mind is reminding me of all those thoughts one by one. Everyday feels like Im waking with a new chain that is slowing me down more, with its own new lock and its own new key, and I cant even find the key to the first lock yet. Its midnight where I live. I have 22 exercises of math that I shouldve done during the holidays, due for Sunday. I want to do them now so I can have at least 2 days of fun, but I dont feel like its worth it. I dont feel like anythikg is worth it. I know this is a long text and its very messy, Im sorry, Im tired duh and in a horrible state whie writing this. But I do hope that you would take a bit of your time to read this, I always wanted to talk about this and sharing it with others and Im finally doing it, so this is very important to me. If you read this fully, I cant stress how much Im thankful. Really. Tldr grossly I have a constant crippling feeling of emptiness, distress, guilt, slowness, frustration and sadness governing my life, and I feel like there is no hope for me.",
    "Please help me I am so tired of all. I dont know how long I can keep fighting. Sorry for the vent but i have nobody to talk to. Background I am a 30yo woman with diagnosed endometriosis, adenomyosis and possible chronic fatigue sindrom. I always had period problems, I had a lot of problems and fatigue the last two years but the last six months the pain and fatigue have skyrocketed making me unable to work or study outside home. I am a Spanish migrant living in Belgium with my partner, struggling to learn flemish and to feel that I belong here. I cant rely on my parents abusive father  mum that wont defend me. I still habe a couple of friends but they are tired of hearing my complaints. ... I got depressed three years ago after a lot of bad luck with jobsstudies. With some therapy and antidepressants I finally got better. Last year i was feeling much better to the point where I improved a lot in my flemish skills and found a job gardening. Then my other diseases hitted hard and I needed to quit the job because I was to weak to do it. I went back to school to learn more flemish. I managed to pass a course despite all the pain and fatigue and missing a lot of clases. My teacher cant stand that I do well without going to all the clases and she told me that she wanted to fail me but as I had a 710 the secretary didnt allowed it. The next course she had a easy solution. She refused to let me do the last exams. As technically I failed the course not doing the last exams she could finally fail me. The secretary didnt help me at all. Now I sit at home in daily pain seeing how all my hopes for the future are going down the drain. ... My GP didnt believe in my symptoms and was two years ignoring them. I just changed to a new one. She the new GP knows that I am diagnosed with two chronic painful diseases but she refused to give me any painkillers because just a paracetamol should be enough.",

I try to keep talking to her and I ask her to talk to me, but she kept getting more and more quieter, hesitant, then she starts apologizing, saying shes sorry for being a burden on me, saying that shes going to hurt me, saying theres nothing I can do to help her, and Im trying my best, I told her I love her so many times, I told her that Im here for her and I dont care if shes at her best or her worst, I told her that the next time I see her Im going to hold her tightly in my arms and then give her a passionate kiss, that Im going to buy her something nice and make her feel special, that Im going to live her no matter what state shes in, but she was still being really quiet and eventually just left me on read so I left her along. I kept trying to get her to talk to me, I wasnt trying to make her day something she didnt want to tell me, I just wanted to know that she was going to be ok before I fell asleep. Idk Im scared, a few weeks ago we were in a call, and she starts talking and venting to me about all the shit going on in her life, she starts crying really hard, then she admitted to breaking a mirror and cutting herself with it and that just fucking broke my heart. What do I do. I have no idea. I love this woman with every fiber of my being. I care for her and her wellbeing. When I see her like this, its like my heart loses a piece of its soul, if that even makes sense. Please, help. Is there anything I could possibly do. Edit ok, before I posted this, I got insanely depressed. I wanted to get high and numb myself like I usually do when I feel like this, but I only have a little bit of thc oil in my cart left and I was saving it for fun times with friends and with her, and I didnt want to waste it so instead of doing that, I decided to write a song.",

    "Am I depressed? (SERIOUS) I made this reddit because I do not know where else to go. I have not been the man that I used to be and it is tearing me apart. I have been tired all the time, lack of a will to eat I would previously binge eat but now I dont want to eat anything, I dont wanna talk to anyone and I stay secluded in my room all day, I am irrationally anxious especially around intimacy, I lash out at people, and finally I dont have any motivation whatsoever to do my schoolwork or job. I come from a traditional Hispanic household and I cant really bring up these things because I have to be more of a man. Yesterday I blew up at my girlfriend of a year and I was so mean that we nearly broke up. This is not normal and I never used to be this way, I mentioned how I might be depressed and honestly thats the only thing that has held us together, but she does not want to talk to me, rightfully so, and I have zero desire to do anything especially with the amount of guilt I have for mistreating her the way that I did.

    "Does anyone else feel like the saturation in their life is turned down? The best way I can describe how I feel is feeling as if someone has turned down the saturation in my life. I can feel emotions. When Im with friends and family or watch a funny video I laugh and smile, but it just feels empty? Lifeless? Like on a scale of 110 10 being the happiest I know I should be feeling a 10 and in general the situation is a 10 but for some reason I cant seem to get past a 5 at most. Its like my brain is saying this is funny you should laugh and feel happy but I just dont feel that? At least not fully. Its like my 5 is other peoples 10s, both are fully happy just one is less than the other. When other people are laughing so much theyre in tears and cant catch their breath Im only chuckling, even though I know the situation is funny. I cant even remember a time where I laughed so much I was in tears. When I laugh it almost feels like a chore or an automatic response that I could just as easily not do. This is hard to explain but when I laugh and smile its like im not physically feeling it. What I imagine true happiness to feel like is a warmness, something you can physically feel in your body, but when I smilelaugh the outside physically changes but inside I dont feel anything. It almost feels as if Im acting but Im not because I do know the situation is funny. Its like theres a disconnect somewhere. Its hard to explain. And this is just one emotion, I feel this with everything. The only emotions I seem to be able to feel the strongest are annoyanceanger and sadness, but even thats toned down, not saturated, lifeless.",

    "Girlfriend with depression pushes me away Hello, Me and my girlfriend have been dating for a few months now and everything was going good. I could see her love and smile and she was constantly there to either do something or help me. Now I know she had a history of selfharm and depression and Im not one to change her for what she feels, because I know thats almost impossible in the case of depression. Still I told her that Im there for here whenever shes in need. Yet ever since a week or two ago she started pushing me away and started to cut herself again. Before we started the relationship she told me she would probably push me away and said that she didnt mean for it to happen and was sorry if she would hurt me in any way. To be honest I didnt really think it would be this bad, but thats not the thing that hurts me the most. Personally, as a loved one, I think that seeing your loved one slowly fade away is the most painful part. It feels as if someone took over her body. I talked to her about it and I know she still cares about me, because she doesnt want me to feel bad. I told her that I would manage and that I would always be there for here and love her no matter what, but I dont know if I did the right thing or not and would like some advice in how to help her get through this phase. Lots of love and respect for all those who deal with this.",

    "Feeling bad for doing better? Let me start with a little backstory. My mental health has been slowly deteriorating since October. It got to the point in JanuaryFebruary where I couldnt function normally, I wasnt going out, I couldnt eat, slept the days away and I even failed one of my classes because I couldnt focus on studing. At the end of February I went to my universitys psychologist and the lady suggested that I should go to the psychiatrist and go on antidepressants. I wasnt really surprised so Ive made the appointment and was really hopeful to get my life together. But then the coronavirus happend, my appointment got cancelled, uni went online and I had to go back home. I was terribly disappointed, to say the least. And because Im home and Im around people all the time I dont allow myself to be extremely depressed. I force myself to go out of bed, to eat, to somehow function because Im scared to show how Im trully feeling. Ive completely disconnected from my feelings to the point where I dont feel anything. And in the back of my head there is that voice, that is saying that Im faking being depressed, that if I wanted to I couldve been better at the begging of the year, that its all in my head and I had no reason to feel this way. So my question is how to understand that just because Im doing better at the moment Im not magically healthy? Because Im afraid that Ill convince myself that I dont need help and I wont ever go to psychiatrist.",

Hes become the brattiest and most rude child Ive ever seen. He used to be a very nice and polite kid, but now he knows he can get away with being a total asshole, so he constantly acts like a total asshole. He says stuff like give me the TV remote or Ill kill you and cut your eyes out, like horror movie scenarios. I get screamed at if I try to discipline him and tell him he doesnt need to be saying that sort of thing. If I was to do the same thing, I would be screamed at, told to get a job Im mentally and physically disabled, currently going through occupational therapy to help find me a suitable job, but this isnt enough to keep her happy, have things taken away, etc. Another brother of mine m, 14 completely agrees that my moms parenting is ineffective. My mom is nicer to him than she is to me, but shes still unnecessarily rude to him as well. Weve both tried bringing it up to her, but she just gets defensive and resorts to personal attacks against us both. For example, for me she would say something like well you dont work and youre taking all my money and for my brother she would say stuff like well youre just on your computer all day. She also defends her crappy parenting by saying you wouldnt understand, youre not a parent I may not be a parent and I dont plan on ever being one, but at least I know that no one, much less 4 year old children, shouldnt be punching people to get what they want and using threatening demands. I dont know how much longer I can keep taking all these attacks while my little brother is allowed to be a dick.

    "How do I(32F) support my husband (45M) through depression My husband and I have been together for 6 years, married for 5 and overall have a wonderful relationship. He truly is my best friend. We have worked through numerous issues and hes done a lot of work on his mental health, but refuses to go to any type of treatment we also cant afford anything. He quit his job about a month prior to the pandemic hitting and has been unemployed since. He tries to supplement income with doing food delivery, but even that has slowed down as time has progressed through no fault of his own, he schedules and works, but orders are far and few between. He has always struggled with anger and depression and has narcissistic tendendacies, but recognizes that and tries to work through it. How can I currently support him? He recognizes that hes spiraling into his dark place but doesnt think anything can help. Lack of income contributes greatly. At the start of the pandemic I helped him start a YouTube channel to give him something to focus on and have goals, but now that has just turned into more frustration and its work as opposed to fun. Is there anything I can do to help him? I feel like my positive attitude is just making things worse. TLDR My husband is spiraling into a dark place, how can I help him?",
    "Wife wants space to fight depression Sorry if wrong thread but I feel like maybe people have more first hand experience with something like this. So a month ago, my wife moved out of our home after admitting that her depression has taken its toll on her and she gave me the old quote I love you, but Im not in love with you. We have been married just shy of a year but have been together for 6 years prior to that. She was distraught when she dropped that bombshell on me and I felt my whole world crumble. She is adamant that I havent done anything wrong and that Ive done nothing but care, respect and been loyal to her and she feels ashamed to feel like this, and she just needs to have time and space for her self to figure out herself and if she got into a relationship with me for the right reasons she was in 2 really toxic relationships previously and then started a relationship straight away with me, and she doesnt know if I was a crutch for her or if it was genuine. For a while she has been unhappy with her job, the house we live in and our financial situation finances are now pretty much resolved after making some sacrifices and also with lockdown she has essentially been a prisoner in her own home for 3 weeks. I have given her the perfect opportunity to tell me if she was having an affair. I told her that if she told me the honest truth, I will not react in anger or resentment, and I would just accept her decision and I would have to think things through for a while. She again has been adamant there is nobody else involved. She has booked her self in for councelling with her depression and I think that starts pretty soon. I feel in complete limbo land at the moment and I feel scared and alone and worried about what the future holds. I have made contingency plans if things go south. I speak to friends and family about this situation and the advice is poor at the best of times. People keep telling me that I should give her an ultimatum and pressure her into coming back, which I know is completely wrong and its something I should not do. I have made the conscious decision to fight with every strand of my being to save this marriage and I will not be the one that ends it.",

It went well for the first couple of weeks, but as time went on, my depression took away my chance of making something out of my life.

Are my expectations too high even though, in my opinion, theyre pretty much as low as they could possibly get? Am I just knowing the wrong people?

About 3 hours after when the effects had calmed down, i remembered that i saw the cuts and asked her about it and she denied it at first but she eventually showed them to me and i asked her why she did it and she told me that she doesnt even know why, she said its stupid and it does nothing for her but she does it anyway. Fast forward to present day, the cuts are now on her wrists not super deep she does it with a box cutter and i have basically begged her not too. She has stopped doing it for about a couple weeks now because she has a job and it requires her to wear a tshirt and she does not want people to notice. I just dont want her to try and take her own life, I try to make her happy whenever im around her but we dont go to the same schools so im not with her all the time. She has about 3 other friends besides me but they are not aware of the situation. We have known eachother for about 3 years now and have been close ever sense im a guy we are very comfortable with one and other but we dont Hug or say we love eachother or anything that we think would make us uncomfortable. We have both established that we dont want to be anything other then friends because we dont want to lose eachother. I dont know what to do, in this situation, I have never been suicidal hopefully will never get to that point. I dont want to lose her and i honestly dont know what Id do if i did, I feel like im not enough to make her happy anymore. Please give me advice.",
    "Anyone here have reverse seasonal affective disorder - i.e.: summer depression? If so, could use some advice It took me months to recover Bc I couldnt find any type of add on medication that I could tolerate that helped. During these spells I literally feel as if Im drugged  I am searching for words, I have no energy. I feel as if Im literally impaired or like I have taken a sedative. I understand it must sound dramatic, but Ive not been able to find anything medication wise that is able to help. I had a gene site test and Ive tried the meds listed in my green bucket and the side effects were so intense I couldnt continue on them, not to mention theyre not covered by our insurance so we paid over 1500.00 last summer on meds that didnt work. I find it difficult to find other people who have this and especially difficult to convey to my prescribing Dr. what Im going through. Additionally, I dont understand why it just happened so recently and without much warning like cause and effect. I have had depression most of my adult life and have been able to manage it with medication and lifestyle changes, but this summer thing is a different animal. Now its June and Im hoping that I can do some prevention as I feel like Ive exhausted meds. options. I have an appointment with my provider this week and I need to be as pro active as I can now in case I have this experience again. I just dont know what to ask for at this point, nor what to even do  or if I even have to do anything. Maybe it wont happen  I mean anything is possible, but I feel like I need to at least try to be prepared. Anyone have experience with this and any tips? I am thinking of preparing myself for a ketamine infusion or something this year. I just cannot imagine going through it again Bc it lasted so long this past summer well into the fall and I got to the point of being so low it was scary. A Dr I see occasionally suggested planning a vacation during the time when I usually feel this come on  sounds good, but also  could be a train wreck. Anyway  anything would be helpful.

Ive always felt just very second place to everyone in my life, but that I can at least rationalize away by saying that theyre at least still friends with me at all.

Im the person who gets hit up after someone got dumped or if they need something quick or they need a distraction. Someone just did that to me and it just destroys my selfesteem every time.

Ive never had celebrity crushes until I was first diagnosed with clinical depression and I went into a rabbit hole. Ive always had this old soul thing, where Ive always had nostalgia for past decades, not only the aesthetic but thinking my life would be better in a different decade  especially seeing the world with Covid  I also deleted my social media 1 year ago Bc how bad it affect my mental state and only came on Reddit to get support. I got out of it, but a little background is I am a survivor of childhoodamp adult sexual abuse amp never had a real relationship due to it. I was doing well mentally until I had to see my abuser which is one of my family members by accident by walking into a family event and not knowing they would be there. Fast forward to now I am 28F. I went to a concert. It was a 80s rock band. Being a rock and roll super fan I love as excited to see this band. They were amazing live amp Ive always had a crush on the young version of the guitarist. Ive read his books and watched his interviews in the past. after the concert I found a way to stalk his Instagram amp watch all his old interviews amp old performances. Triggering my obsession. Ive spent days watching it but realized its ruining me and the young version of him doesnt even exist. Hes old and ugly now. I just became obsessed with the thought that if I was alive in the 80s I could of dated Him and be apart of the exciting life of rock n roll.

    "17 year old forced to stop Paxil 20mg cold turkey. Looking for Advice! I was very recently diagnosed with borderline personality disorder as well as anxiety, anxiety related insomnia, and severe depression from the previous improper diagnosis of Bipolar ii, and I was taking Paxil 20mg for 2 months. After my third change of psychiatrist, I was instructed to stop Paxil cold turkey in favor of staring prozac in 2 weeks because of the risks associated with adolescents taking Paxil. He is adamant on me stopping as soon as possible and I do understand why this is important, for the drug is still not FDA approved for treating depression in teens even though it is commonly used for it. I am currently 3 days in, and I am experiencing the full force of the withdrawals Severe headaches and zaps, cold sweats, strange dreams and waking up in sweats, equilibrium and balance issues, tingling of extremities and numbness in hands, lightheadedness, suicidal ideation, dissociation, severe mood swings and racing thoughts. As someone very new to all of this and the processes associated with treatment, Id really appreciate anything, and I mean anything, anyone has to say about their personal experiences with withdrawals from Paxil or any antidepressant for that matter as well as any tips for managing this hell for the next 2 weeks. Thankfully, I am not currently enrolled in high school, so i am not forced to deal with this while stuck in class, but its challenging to go through this seemingly alone without contact from others.

    "I've been depressed a long time and I'm really struggling right now I think Ive had depression for my whole life or at least early in my life, I was on the path toward depression. Now Im an adult and I feel like Im only getting worse as time goes on. Each time I get low Im going lower and its lasting longer. At about the end of the lockdown in my area, I had a breakdown. I had a panic attack that lasted for far too long and then for weeks afterward I would have them multiple times a day and for hours. Its not as bad as that anymore but the anxiety has been worse since then. I dont know how to describe the severity of my problem. Examples I guess could be I quit my job five months ago in large part for my mental health but also a myriad of other reasons of course and have not returned to work since. I had an injury that will likely require surgery and Ive been avoiding the doctor for going on seven months now and Its getting worse as a result. I also spend most of my days doing mostly nothing but find distractions from doing anything meaningful and have consistently failed to break that pattern. I want to live my life and I dont know if Im qualified to handle this on my own anymore but I dont know what to do. I dont want antidepressants and things like that. The thing is, I know what the things are that help me. Having a schedule and sticking to it, not smoking weed and fasting. Like, I remember what it was like when I was feeling better than I am now. Im just struggling to not keep falling. I feel like Im beginning to ramble so before this becomes a rant, can someone offer me some advice?",

    "I cannot see a bright side or way out of my situation right now Im a sophomore coming to the end of my second year at this school and I have made zero friends, done zero things with anyone since welcome week freshman year and have only spent two quarters on campus. And by the time I graduate I will not have spent a full year at SCU. COVID cut off freshman year, obliterated this year, I will get to do study abroad next year which im very grateful for yes but it does have its downsides, and then senior year Ill graduate in the spring. There will be zero time for me to make any friends at SCU. I only have one quarter next year to do it in person before being gone until the next fall. How the hell am I supposed to make any sort of meaningful friendships or experiences in one quarter if Im a stupid introvert. Im gonna end up looking back on college the same way I do high school, four years of skirting the edge of fun and seeing everyone else have what I cant. I hate it, its crushing me. Theres zero hope for me, I will not have a fun college experience. Others will make friends theyll be friends with for years, Id be lucky to make one for a day. I hate it I hate it I hate myself. Last year in the spring I talked to someone about feeling like this, and they said dont worry, I made most of my friends my second year. You have plenty of time and that gave me hope for a bit but thats gone now. I didnt make any friends last year, none this year, Ive got one quarter to next year.

Ive wrote songs before, Ive played many instruments before, Ive spent hours playing around secretly in GarageBand. I took singing lessons for a while.

The violin is gone now. And every once in a while on some stupid magical moment, I play piano. But I still long for music. Even with drawing, which I put my heart and soul into, I still long for music. Even when sewing, I sing. Even when Im outside, I sing and sing and cry. Because Im so weak. Im weak because I couldnt sing in front of others. Im weak because Im so shy. Im weak because I couldnt even sing properly with my singing teacher. I never let go. Im so mad at myself. I want to let this dream go, but I dont at the same time. Isnt it enough for me? Art, drawing, and sewing? Why do I still cling to music? I cant sing. I sound horrible when Im standing in front of people. My legs shake and I cry. I cant even sing outside anymore, because Im afraid of neighbors hearing. I can only sing with headphones on because even I judge myself. Im my worst enemy. Why do I STILL want to sing? Why do I still find myself singing when I can? Why cant I just let this stupid dream go? This stupid worthless dream. Im going to art school to draw, which Im still bad at. Im not going for music. I want to let go of song.",

    "26. Depressed, socially anxious, lost and suicidal. Since i was a little boy I have always been shy. The problem is I never really grew out of it. I have always sheltered myself from doing normal things that probably would have helped me break out of my shell. Now i am 26 and I cant stop dwelling on all of the experiences and fun I have missed out on because of my depression and social anxiety that i had and still have. Even as a little kid I had this problem. For example almost every first day of school I had I cried and wanted to go home. Even at a few of my birthday parties i cried. My parents tried to get me to play football and i even was told i was going to be the quarterback but I stopped going before the season even started because I was afraid and embarrassed to say hike in front of my parents. Looking back I just wish i could be happy like everyone else. I also feel like I lived in the shadow of my 3 older siblings and a lot the energy and focus of my parents was on them, my oldest brother especially. One of the happiest times of my life was the 6th grade, I was in the cool clique at school. I had a lot of friends, one of them being a girl I had a crush on for a couple years before that and I had a lot of confidence and finally began slowly coming out of my shell. After that school year my parents sold our house and we moved to a different town. I knew my parents wanted to move for a while and honestly it was my biggest fear. This devestated me. I literally was in fetal position crying for at least 2 weeks after we moved into the new house. I went from a happy kid to a suicidal 12 year old within a short amoumt of time. Like i said always dealt with shyness and depression but I feel like this put me way back into a hole I could not get myself out of and has turned me into the man i am today. I spent the next 2 years in middle school wanting to end my life. A big part of my brain focuses on high school and that fact that I pretty much did nothing during it besides smoke weed and drink.",
    "Everything fell apart after a failed business and a failed psyche. Figuring out next steps. 26m I had pretty moderate social anxiety through high school and college ultimately fueling depression. Went to get treatment before senior year of college, threw me on Zoloft and Klonopin. Helped a bit and was doing okay, graduated with great grades despite issues, information systems and marketing undergrad. Had a pleathora of random skills across the board mostly in the real of webdev and design, used to be passionate about photography but all passions have fallen off lately. Started a freelance drone services business out of undergrad despite not understanding just how much student debt I was in....in my name 60,000, in my parents name another ungodly amount...further fueling depression. Still living with parents in hope of hitting it big with the business. Things started off slowly so I went into an MBA program on the weekends while working on the business during the week. Psychiatrist put me on adhd meds too which helped. Graduated 2017 from that, business wasnt making any profit still, mainly breaking even didnt start off with any real capital so I was bootstrapping. Was still doped up on meds so I was still hopeful and disregarded the fact I wasnt making any real money. 2018 really nasty suicidal depression starts kicking in along with cognitive side effects and deteriorating memory. Business still breaking even, though halfway through the year almost landed a huge deal that wouldve put me way in the green. Came soooo close but then everything fell apart. Psychiatrist leaves the state halfway through the year and have to find a new one. New one takes me off klonopin too fast and takes away my adhd med and Im left like a deer in headlights for 6 months in a state of psychotic withdrawal unable to answer texts, emails or phone calls...couldnt even leave the house. Psych didnt care and made me suffer through it. Business fizzled out, wasnt making any money, trying to recover at home. 6 months later things started getting a little better, started tapering my way off Zoloft slowly. Got back on adhd med in 2019, went and got a low paying but close IT job in September.",

Her father is just the densest motherfucker and, while he would probably want to help her, he is too stupid to realize she is telling the truth. Her sister would probably just push god onto her if she went to her again. She selfharms by bruising herself and has had thoughts of suicide. As mentioned before, she has substance abuse issues. She drinks too frequently and has also taken prescription medication. Her family wont do shit to help her and fuck the public school. How do I help her? She isnt even 17.",

    "Life’s going downhill and everything that happens is mainly my fault My next issue is this incident that happened with my crush. Now Im assuming its normal to crush on people when youre 13, right? Well this one was my fault. I was texting my friend on discord, and we brought the topic up. We were just joking around, and then I said something, a little more... questionable. He laughed at it, and so did I, because say what you will about it, it was pretty funny. Were both in this discord server with a lot of people from our school in it, including my crush. However, one time when I was on the server, we were teasing each other. Normal, right? But then I got this dm saying shut up or Ill leak the photo or something around those lines. I was like um... okay because even though I knew what he did was technically black mail, I didnt want the photo to be leaked so I just shut up. This threat continued a couple more times until this happened. He didnt leak it to the chat, but he showed it to some of my friends. They were like bruh wtf and I explained the context of the image and how I didnt mean anything I actually said. But then he showed it to this one person, and it was this boy my crush is edating. I was on the server, when I got a dm from him saying Ill leak the photo to the server. When I pleaded him not to, he just said Yes and then sent the photo into the server, where everyone saw, including my crush his girlfriend. I was miserable. I left the server and went to bed, talking to myself about how I should just kill myself tonight well get to that soon and end it all. It was a while ago, and the drama seemed to die down, but I had to explain to my crush everything and she seemed to have forgiven me. However, people still bring it up and show the image, especially when my crush is still around. I beg to them not to as it obviously makes her uncomfortable but they wont stop, my sin wont leave me, no matter what I do.",
    "I don't have the energy to know new people I dont know what to say or where to begin, Im not good at expressing my feelings. Its been 2 years since my gf broke up with me, I havent been well since then, I tried to know new people and I met this girl who became very close to me and I started to forget about my ex, then she disappeared too. We we very close and we shared everything about us, but now she doesnt even reply back. Now, I dont have the energy to know new people, even when Im trying to overcome this and message other people.. you probably guessed it right. They dont reply back.",
    "Nothing is right in my life. I don't know if I can be fixed. I was both abused and neglected starting at about 5 years old. Prior to that I was raised very well, then my parents just took their anger out on me physically and verbally for years until eventually they just told me they gave up on me. I hated myself so much in highschool and would never let girls get close to me and even developed a violent hatred towards them. I became a drug addict, using opiates mixed with other drugs nearly every day to numb how I felt. No one ever caught me and I had to quit on my own. I dont think my brain ever recovered from this either. In the past 2 years Ive stopped enjoying all hobbies. I barely will myself to practice guitar a couple times a week. I cant play video games at all and have maybe put 24 hours into them the last 2 years. I go running everyday because of the endorphins rush but its so incredibly boring and then I remember I have to come back to reality and go to work and be put down by everyone around me. None of the goals I set a year ago excite me. In fact, I live in fear of accomplishing them because I just cant see myself enjoying them. But I changed my mind about what I wanted to do every year before that and I cant afford the time or money I will waste if I change my path yet again. And there is nothing I want to change it to anyways. I have to stick with something for once and the disinterest is killing me. I have physically insecurities that shouldnt bother me but do because Im already in such a fragile mental state. Ive never had a semblance of a relationship or been involved with anyone sexually and the loneliness doesnt help but reinforce my negative image of myself. I have bad genetics and pretty undesirable physical features, so even when Im in good shape Im not much to look at. I used to take pride in my intelligence but I dont have that anymore. My brain has been fried, neglected, and has deteriorated to the point where I may be able to understand complex ideas, but Im slower to process than your average remedial student.",
    "How to stop feeling so tired all the time? Quarantine has been rough on me so far. Its practically been undoing months of therapy for me. Every day I wake up, get something to eat and then end up back in bed because I feel so tired. My boyfriend is concerned about the amount of time I spend in bed but I cant help it. I dont know how to stop feeling so exhausted from not doing anything. Its hard for me to even pick up my iPad to work on my illustrations. I have a hard time even thinking about getting up and I end up taking an unnecessary nap. My whole life I would hang out in my bed because there wasnt anywhere else for me to be due to my living situation. And even now that Im living with my boyfriend l still have a hard time getting up because Im just so fucking tired and depressed, I just want to sleep forever until this pandemic is over. Im starting to question if I even exist at this point. Any kind words would be appreciated. Thank you",

Ive been reaching out to local therapists each of which tell me theres a 14 month waiting list. I need someone in my life please. Everyday is the same and doesnt feel like real life anymore. Get up, go to work, go home, sleep. I dont have family, and the few friends I have are all busy with their own lives. I have tried to commit suicide in the past and been in the hospital a few times.

    "Breaking up gave me depression.. and I want to speak my mind.. please be nice. Eventually, she broke it off in December 2019. Moving on to January, I moved to a new country, a new city, a new environment, and things seemed like everything was fresh. I had the fresh start that I was craving for. But things didnt go as well as I expected. I got depressed, alone and so far away? I didnt have anyone to open up to, and a PHYSICAL connection with anyone. I did not have any friends in this new country. I started to open up a habit that I have locked away a long time ago, I started cutting. I cut myself when I was a kid so that my parents would notice, and signal to them that Im not ok. But this time, I cut myself in a place where no one could ever see, my shoulders. So whats my motive? The motive was weird, but it worked. First of all, it calmed me in the midst of an anxiety attack. It took all the anxiety away in an instant. Secondly, If I was a selfharmer, then no one will ever accept me for the person I am. I know Im wrong, but it worked. Yes, I was lying to myself, but at least I was not stressing on why I did not have friends like other teenagers. As if I was forced to live alone because of my lifestyle. It was my sanctuary for a month, my cuts started to get deeper. I woke up one day and realized how badly scarred my shoulder was. My bedsheets were constantly covered in blood, my pillow, my trashcan is filled with blooded tissues. At a point, my cuts werent healing properly because I would cut across the cuts and left nasty scars on my shoulder. I couldnt continue. Even though It helped me, I dont want these scars to stay forever. I needed to stop before its too late. So, I stopped hurting myself only for the fear of creating new scars. I turned to religion for answers, I have been blessed to receive answers, I know 100 that this is all going to blow over, and the sun will shine on me once more.",
    "My cat went missing and I need advice on how to cope. In my previous post I mentioned my cat went missing and I cant really go look for her due to lockdown regulations in my country being so strict that I cant even walk in the street I live in South Africa . Right now it looks like shes not coming back but i am hoping she will. I have struggled with anxiety and depression for years and I am finding it impossible to cope with losing my other cat. My previous cat went missing last year around the same time but at least back then I could look for her and hand out flyers. This cat was my baby and I raised her. She always comforted me when I was sad and was an overall sweetheart. Its like theres a void in my house where she used to be if that makes sense I am so depressed I cant even get out of bed. Is there anything I can do that will help me cope with this? Because I am just so heartbroken and I can see its taking a toll on the people around me as well.",
    "Should I kill myself? I am the most uninteresting person and I feel like I am the only one who puts effort into any of my relationships. Ill call her Kayla. I have actually blocked of so much of my memory of her, like I remember maybe 3 or 4 moments over a year and 8 months or so of dating. We started of pretty good, but I believe we were both immature and didnt know how to set boundaries or handle a relationship. Which is what led to a lot of fighting. I do remember we fought a bit around a year into the relationship because she kept cancelling plans with me to go out and play games. Like I never tried to get in the way of her friendships, but she cancelled our anniversary date, and just a few other dates we set up literally the evening before or the morning of to hang out with friends. I told her that I wanted her to hang out with friends but the constant cancelling plans with me and not trying to reschedule was hurtful. Ahh, a lot of it is coming back now. I would honestly say we were a bit codependent, she relied on me for emotional support as her mother was extremely controlling, I relied on her for my social needs. Not a healthy relationship. We ended up breaking up after growing a bit distant, and at the end she played a bunch of games with me. Her mother didnt want me dating her which was the main reason we broke up. So she told me if I can convince her mom, shed let me get back with her. I didnt do this of course but I was distraught. I felt like I had nothing. I started playing piano in grade 11 but quit while we dated because of the effort it took. Most of my time went towards school and her. I ignored a lot of my friendships more than I should have during the relationship so I was in a terrible spot. It made me realize how unhealthy a person I was. I had struggles reaching out to the 3 friends or so I had because I always questioned whether they liked me. But when we broke up, they were there for me.",

I tried to provide a safe environment to talk about them many times but after she does tell them, she feels a little happy, but the anxiety is a lot worse. This was caused because of her ex in the past, and weve been working together to help for over 6 months. Shes definitely been getting better, but I cant help with this because she just lies, and when I try to tell her, she shuts me down worrying it will hurt me. And I just dont know what to do.

    "Never had anywhere near the success I want in life I 25m am currently unemployed. Ive really struggled to make friends I have a few now or date anyone in life. As well, I hated commuting to university and my BA and MA arent too useful. All the career fields I want to go into civil service, high school teacher, physician, government lawyer are extremely competitive to get into. Ive been unemployed for a year now and I cant get myself to apply for jobs because I really lack any practical skills or relevant experience Ive only worked in retail and as a TA. Im not even sure I have it in me to go back to school for something more practical and I frankly I dont really want to. Im just sick of trying in life and never really getting anywhere I want to.

But I dont really want to parish from existence either, however I always feel the spike wanting of ending it all when I come across sharp objects or any kind of thing that would aid in me ending everything. I feel like Ive lost battles upon battles of endless depression since 7th grade. Im in 10th grade now. Previously Ive tried to kill myself in 8th grade, I never really tried after but I feel urges too still. Me and my dad had bad falling outs, three times, in almost the same year. I almost lost my mom and my brother because I was always angry and upset with the rage I let control me. Ive lost all but few friends now that Im desperately holding on too, but I just dont know if I can continue to deal with this pain because no matter how man counselors or therapists Ive seen it alway just seems to never get better. I mean Ive tried alternatives by listening to music, playing video games, livestreaming to twitch, watching YouTube to help, never really satisfies me. Its been weeks since I showered last, Ive basically stopped going to work on time, stopped caring for my body for the most part. I really dont know what to do and I feel so lost.",
    "I can feel it coming Good evening yall. I struggled with depression throughout college. For about a year after college, i struggled with suicidal thoughts. I discussed this with a therapist and she seemed to indicate it was situational i was coming out of college into the great unknown of adulthood and was completing a year internship on 500 a month. I became an official adult with a night job. The night job did not help the depression. I had insurance now told my primary care doctor that i was depressed she recommended yoga. I lost 2 dear people to suicide within 4 mouths of each other. The grief was intense  its been 10 years. After perhaps 3 years, i started feeling better. Honestly, i felt ok for the past 7 years. Covid hit and that was a struggle. Im located in one of the first hot spots of covid and it was stressful, but Im ok, my family is ok. Ive been struggling the past few months. I can feel the depression sending its roots in. I dont enjoy things. I cant remember shit. I cant determine if my relationship is shit or if its me. I dont want to be miserable like i was in college. Im scared and worried.",

I tried to kill myself twice over seeing my friends in better positions than me, and I dont think Ill be able to secure a job that gives me enough money to try all the things I want. Im not graduating from an Ivy League, Im not a doctor either, so I wont make enough to travel the world and do the stuff that Instagram and Reddit always puts on my feed. Even if I manage to win the lottery or something, I know nothing compares to the ideals that I make up in my head. Nothing on this earth looks fun or interesting anymore. I just wish I can jump into games or books and live my life there where anything is possible, but here, you dont expect aliens to take you to worlds beyond your imaginations, superpowers, or to save the world. The way I see it, Ill just be working my ass off with the occasional vacation until the day I decide to kill myself. Because of that, Im not motivated to try hard enough because I know everything is second best to my expectations. Whats the point of trying if you cant get what you truly want in the end, just a consolation prize? Its a vicious cycle, and I feel like a car running on an empty tank when Im not working for myself, but just for external reasons like not wanting to fucking starve when I graduate. Im ready to leave this fucking earth if I know nothing makes me happy anymore. Ive learned from my past two attempts, and I think the next one will finally work.",

My sister had to move out because she made my mother mentally broken, I had alcohol poisoning at school, we had a stepfather who made me and my mother mentally broken my mother had to go to the psychiatric hospital for a few months, i almost had to go to the childrens home which would probably have been a good decision and some more stuff which i cant talk about in detail cause it would take way to long. Now to the current situation. Lately since about 8 months I have a lot of worries and fears about my life. I often think that my life is worthless and that i did and do everything wrong.

Many praise me for being such a calm guy and always having everything under control I actually do almost no sport anymore that was one of only things that I enjoyed. I have no structure in my daily routine. On my days off, I sometimes lie around for hours on my bed and just think about it all the mistakes i have made and all the bad things that have happened. I dont really enjoy anything anymore beside listening to music or playing video games. I almost no longer write to my friends, sometimes only reply to messages after a few days or ignore them completely. Ive had suicidal thoughts for a few years now and then, but I couldnt do it to my mother  family because my mother would probably die from the loss and she means everything for me. I never harmed myself. I never opend up to anyone except my exbest friend i wrote about  and this subreddit rn. I never spoke to a professional therapist or something like that, but I think its about time, since all of this is a heavy burden and I just cant find a way out.",
    "The more I live the more I realise how much I don't fit in And I never will. I feel like a constant burden to be around. I feel like people are sick of me and dont take me seriously. Im a loser. I like loser things. My passions are film, art and cooking. All loser passions. I just feel like finally giving up. My friend ditched me since getting a girlfriend and here I am alone. People just think Im a weirdo and now I believe it. I just dont know which way to turn. Its always been like this and I dont even know anymore. Should I disappear or should I work through it. Im awkward to my boss and I dont think Ill get a promotion. No one wants to help me with my film ideas. I dont know anymore. Im going to sleep it off and wake up tomorrow. I feel confusion from every part of my brain",
    "Stuck in room and need help getting out Lately its been a bit rough. I sleep a good 16 hours a day and eat just one meal a day. I just feel like a log, but unfortunately I have very sweet housemates and I worry Ive disappointed them beyond repair. I try to avoid interactions with them and it feels horrible. I want to get up, clean my room, contribute to the home by cooking meals and all that. Unfortunately weve been in and out of lockdown so I havent had much work for the last 2 months and needless to say, the bank account isnt happy. I kind of want to pack up and live out of my van just to avoid disappointing people and not worry about rent anymore. Can I please just have some advice to get out of this loop? Thanks kindly.",
    "I want the comfort of depression Ive been on the edge of a depression episode for a while. I find myself tearing up, coming home exhausted, lacking motivation, faking a smile... but Im doing everything possible to not slip into the episode. Im going out with friends, cooking dinner, DISTRACT DISTRACT DISTRACT... Im basically mastering the fake it till you make it but honestly, Im tired of doing that. Depression has taken my to my lowest points in life... but its so damn comforting. Staying in bed under my weighted blanket, crying, not having to respond to the outside world... that sounds so nice. And its like a drug trying to entice me to come back to it. And I know in my brain that I need to not listen to these intrusive thoughts. I know I need to keep fighting it off and faking it and distracting myself until this edge is gone... but Im too close to letting go. I almost WANT to let go. Im just looking for someone to relate. All my support groups have already told me to think of my progress and my daughter and my students Im a teacher but Im tired of always doing things for everyone but myself. Idk. Anyone?",
    "Everything fell apart after a failed business and a failed psyche. Figuring out next steps. Got back on adhd med in 2019, went and got a low paying but close IT job in September. Continued the Zoloft taper, and was okay until I began reaching the lower doses and as the winter kicked in the depression and suicidal ideation began to really kick my ass again. The job isnt in the field I want, Im spending most of the pay paying off credit cards I was using for the business. Now Im 6 months in to the low paying IT job, with 6 figures worth of student debt to pay off, stuck at home with no savings parents have no savings and are financially irresponsible... I blame myself but partly blame them for letting me take out so much to go to school when I couldve gone to a great local state school with my grades.. Im near NYC so thats where Ive been applying to a bunch of jobs but with basically no luck, apparently my degrees are worthless. Im still in a very anxious state and dont think Ill continue my Zoloft taper for a while, honestly Im about as anxious as I was back during the klonopin withdrawal. I could reach out to alumni from my school but I hesitate based on my current state of affairs. The depression plagues me a bit more lately, and I cant tell but I think the IT job may even be adding to my depression. Its relatively easy and keeps me out of the house and around guys my age which is nice. I think the years of being on Klonopin and Zoloft are really taking a toll on my mind as I try to get off. I cant think original thoughts, its just the same thing every single day, like a nightmare groundhog day. I appreciate anyone who took time to read through this post, really struggling to figure out my next steps, feel like Ive been stuck in the same headspace of suffering for a year and a half now. I keep telling myself the same story and it doesnt get me anywhere. Thing is this story seems to be the only thought stuck on replay every day. Just how different things couldve been. How Im the only one I know whos ever faced this level of mental deterioration.",
    "Needing Time to Heal But BF doesn’t get it....am I in the wrong? I was involved with a really good, caring man preCovid, long distance. I love him and thought it was going to be permanent one day. We had a good healthy relationship in the past despite being long distance. During Covid, I didnt see him for way over a year. We kept in close contact, daily calls and texts, but my depression took a turn. I started taking different meds and was struggling. I tried to tell him this many times via phone and by text and he would give me tough love type responses such as people have it worse than you or it could be worse or dont worry so much, look how far youve come or things will improve soon with Covid. I felt like he didnt understand and I basically just stopped trying to explain after trying so often and receiving no sort of acknowledgement or empathy from him. I admit I got fed up trying. Then I saw him for the first time in March and it just felt off between us. I was very unwell mentally in my mind, felt like I had a lot going on mentally and I just felt disconnected from him. After the visit, he kept on saying I seemed different and he asked what was going on with me. I ended up telling him again I was struggling with depression, opened up extensively about the details and explained how awful its gotten. I also sent him literature on major depression to try and give him objective info I thought maybe he could learn from. His response was to say I didnt communicate it to him, and then to say he didnt get it over and over. This was irritating but I patiently tried to be fair and hear him out. Then he continued to harp on how he couldnt fix me and he felt bad that he had no way to fix me. I told him I dont wantneed him to fix me, that I have mental illness and he needed to just let me figure it out with my professional medical help, respect that and be patient. So after that, and our weird visit, it felt like he was just making me feel pressure and stress.",
    "Help feeling things I feel nothing except tired and numb all the time. True happiness is something I havent felt in a long time. Im trying harder and harder every day to at least look happy but its physically draining. Im so exhausted by my days off that I cant do anything except sleep. I originally thought that I was feeling this way because I wasnt happy with how things were in my life. So, I started working at those things hoping that eventually I would feel happy again, but its not working. Something has changed inside of me. I cant pinpoint a time or anything significant that would cause me to feel this way, but its here now and Im struggling to stop it. I want to stop the nothingness. Its unfair to my husband and especially my kids to have to live with someone who cant find joy in even the little things.

    "My girlfriend is suffering from depression, and I’m looking for some advice on how I can be more supportive. For some context, weve been together for almost three years and a large portion of our relationship has been long distance. Shes been suffering from depression for most of her adult life and its been especially bad in recent weeks. Shes a recent college grad and is really stressed out about her future, and whether or not shes making correct decisions for her career. This causes her to feel anxiety, which in turn causes her depression to worsen and this cycle repeats. I know that I cant cure her depression, but I want to do all I can to be supportive while she figures out how best to deal with it. Recently shes been saying she doesnt feel like its fair for me to have to deal with her when shes like this, and shes worried thats its having a negative impact on our relationship. Ive never really had to deal with depression as closely as I am now, and am looking for ways to improve, or even just some advice on things to do to help. I always try to be supportive, letting her know that Im here for her and that I love her. Its been increasingly difficult for me as she often becomes withdrawn, and with the distance and our differing work schedules most of our communication is through texting. Sorry if this post has been a little lengthy, I havent had the chance to talk to anyone other than her about it. I appreciate any advice you guys can share.",
    "At risk of losing the only thing I have left... Please help :( Sorry it's a long one I lost my job. I am being evicted. I have a 5 year old living with me and an 11 year old who doesnt. And my boyfriend is now saying he wants to move back home to Norway... I have no idea what to do, Im a complete mess and feel like my life is at a cross roads. One leads to potentially hurting my daughters, one leads to a literal dead end for me... which will hurt them more. ampx200B Bit of a background Im 31, been abused my entire life, by parents, by siblings, by random strangers and ex partners. Ive been in abusive relationships, mentally and emotionally abused, sexually abused at least 5 or 6 times... Ive been raped. I lost custody of my eldest daughter because her father kidnapped her after I tried seeking help for her anger issues. He refused to bring her home after a visit and the Social Services let him get away with it. My youngest daughter was 8 months old when her father had a heart attack aged 28 on our sofa while I put her to bed. He died instantly. I moved cities and my mother disowned me, so did my brother and my grandparents. I have nobody. ampx200B I ended up in a string of very abusive relationships, got engaged to a man who left me no choice... All the while, I was talking about all of this with my best friend. He was so supportive, so wonderful... I was going to move to the US again, coerced and manipulated into it but I had to meet my best friend first, as it was our one and only chance of meeting in person. So I flew over to Norway to be with him and hang out for 3 days. Nothing happened. Nothing at all... but it was obvious we both wanted it to. He gave me the strength to leave my abusive fiance Who by this point had sent death threats and abusive messages to said best friend and all my other friends, threatened to kill himself and his 3 year old daughter if I didnt move over there. I became a target for abuse from his family after we split up.",

Things I wanted to say to her, my feeling of emptiness, melancholy, and being down moat of the time ia replaced by verbal nods, spacing out, and being blunt. Im afraid that her 1 monrh vacation made ua distant and that bothers me. Maybe Im overthinking things. She wanted some alone me time, but constantly messages and video chatting me. Thats what Im bothered about. Hot and cold. It makes me think what I have done wrong. Al of this I keep to my self. This burdens me.

Recently I thought I found my soulmate. She made me feel a feeling I never felt in my life. She gave me so much needed self confidence and I gave it to her as well. Life was on the up. Things were complicated with current relationships but we knew it was going to be tough and I was willing to give her the world and totally shake mine up for it. At some point something changed. Extreme feelings of happiness to guilt, settling, lack of confidence in the situation and shutting it out. Now I am left feeling not good enough. I knew in the back of my mind I wasnt going to be but was always told otherwise. It felt like the most amazing dream. It was shattered. I dont know why but now I am left feeling a shell of what was being built up. I feel used and betrayed. It has been extremely hard to open up about the situation. I am very private and so is she. I just feel completely devastated and being now totally cut off from even a friendship I feel like someone died and its all my fault. I opened my heart and mind and they are left in tatters. I just dont know how to go on. Any words of advise or personal experience would be so so very grateful. I feel completely lost.",
    "Could a vitamin D deficiency be causing depression entirely? Ive been severely depressed and suicidal for well over a year at this point, but Ive noticed that it started easing a bit around MarchApril the start of winter in my country and then worsening again in AugustSeptember the start of summer, while I was actually happy in June and July, and any moments of suicidal ideation were anxiety driven, not depression. In winter, because its cold, I spend most of the day lazing in the sun yes, I know skin cancer, but I dont care, so about 45 hours of consistent sunlight at least. In summer, I stay out of the sun entirely because its too hot and I absolutely hate the heat. So this makes me think that something is particularly bad in summer to make me significantly more depressed than winter. Perhaps thats a vitamin D deficiency. Has that been the case for anyone else?",
    "I could use some help figuring out if there‘s a possibility I‘m suffering from depression The thing that makes all this so hard to decipher for me is that Im never certain how I feel. I know it sounds stupid but its the best I can describe it. I have some good days where I just hang out with friends in discord and play minecraft all day but theres always that thought in the back of my mind that I dont deserve this. In contrast to that I also have bad days where I feel like Im on the edge of breaking down and giving up on everything. One of the most common feelings I have is hate towards myself. Now the part that every aRe yOU dePResSed? taKE THiS qUiz! website asks Have I thought of suicide? More or less. Ill be as honest as possible in this part. I have thought about if I would survive the distance from the window to the ground outside. I have thought about if it would hurt very much to stab myself. I was never actually anywhere close to doing it. I have also thought about if Im important to my friends or if theyre just with me out of pity. I have thought about if the world would be any different without me in it. So, I have some suspicions that I COULD be depressed. But I also think its possible that im just imagining things because Im just awful. If anyone made it through this, thank you for your time. If anyone wants to spend their time giving me advice i would be grateful. M",

    "26. Depressed, socially anxious, lost and suicidal. One of the only positive things that has happened recently is I began talking to a girl i met on a dating site. We talk for at least 3 hours over the phone everyday. This is the most social activity ive had in a long time even though she does 70 percent of the talking. She likes talking about herself. Hearing her talk about her life only makes me more depressed because she has done so much and made the most out of her life. I honestly have no clue what she sees in me. I shared these feelings with her and to my surprise she is still talking to me, although she doesnt really understand how it feels to have depression and pretty much told me my life is not that bad. So here I am, a 26 year old socially inept man child who has no idea what he wants to do with his life. This dry eye problem is also stressing me out and i really want to get it taken care of so i can move on and do something productive with my life. I really think the military would be a good thing for,mw but I dont want to enlist until my eyes feel better but i also feel like time is running out because i cant join once I get past a certain age. I dwell on the past everyday and i wish I could go back in time. When I think about the past I get depressed and when I think about the future i get anxious. I get so anxious even thinking about being around New people because they will judge me and think i am too quiet. I also am afraid if someone asks about my past and my highschoolcollege life what do I tell them? I dont want to tell people I was a pothead who did nothing in Highschool. I also feel like im playing catch up in learning social skills when everyone else my age just has those skills naturally. I dont know what to do from here.",

I have no closure and still dont even know what happened. She was physically and emotionally abusive to me but never told anyone about it on account of how emasculating it feels. I dont know how you tell people your female partner punches you at home during arguments.

I think for some people suicide is their lifes purpose and I feel like I am finally becoming content with that. But I cant even talk like this openly with my therapist or psychiatrist out of fear of just being committed.

This left me with a couple of questions. ampx200B Dextromorphethan is one of the drugs that can interact with SSRIs to cause the syndrome. I recently had a bad cough and took a lot of it. Also, I dropped acid in the last 3 months, which also can cause the syndrome when mixed with SSRIs. Am I at risk? I havent had any drug of any sort for two weeks, and dont plan to while on Prozac, but I cant help but fear that any latent amount of these drugs in still my system could kill me when I start taking Prozac. ampx200B Would appreciate any insight. ampx200B I also have anxiety so if this question seems ridiculous and paranoid, now you know",
    "Is there a point? Im 19, super bad social anxiety to the point where I cant even go down to the corner store anymore. Im constantly in fear of being judged due to my gynamastia or whatever tf its called. I had a couple friends in highschool but when I dropped out I started getting more depressed to the point where I didnt want anyone around me in fear of me making them sad. I cant talk to people, I just shut down when someone says anything to me and people now think Im a weirdo who doesnt talk. So even if I wanted to open up theyd just think Im more weird right? I just want a friend... Or to not have to kill myself cause at this point it seems the only plausible option.",

It has never been this hard for me to get out of bed, notice something positive in my life, or have fun doing things I enjoy like saxophone or longboarding. I am stuck in an endless cycle of feeling unmotivated to do schoolwork, which makes me feel sad and hopeless. As Im sad and hopeless, I have no motivation to do schoolwork.

    "How do I forgive myself? 7 years ago I met this amazing girl on Instagram when we were both 13. She lived in Ohio and I was from Massachusetts. We talked as friends and grew into a relationship. At the time I knew I wanted her for the rest of my life but I still fell into selfish ways. I would break up with her and talk to other girls. While she just waited cause she was head over heals for me and then wed get back together and that happened countless times.. the final time I broke up with her I really didnt want to. I was taking advice from my dad because some stuff went down and we were going to meet in person again for another summer and wed already been talking for 3 years online. So I asked my dad if I should wait till next summer to finally take the chance? I was angry that we couldnt see each other and I was upset.. wed been planning all year to meet this time and it was ruined because of some stupid stuff she did with her friends.. my dad told me that eventually Id find someone else and I shouldnt waste my youth on one relationship when theres thousands of different chances.. so I broke up with her.. it was one of the hardest parts of her life. She was alone and hurting because I left her again.. I had a itch in the back of my mind that this isnt what you want dont make the same stupid mistakes again, youre in love with her.. a few weeks go by or maybe months and she found someone else. A physical relationship and I just broke. I said some really cruel things to her, very very cruel things.. she told me I want you to hurt like you hurt me and I went ballistic and i said fine you want to see me hurt? And I proceeded to cut my self at least a hundred times on my thighs and repeatedly sending her pictures of what I was doing and she begged me to stop and she cried and she pleaded and I just wouldnt.. years go by shes been in a few relationships and we dont talk.. I find a girl who abused me but I took it because I felt thats what I deserved.. she cheated on me and left me, I was having a breakdown and the girl from Ohio would occasionally check on me.",
    "am I suicidal even if I know I won't kill myself? Sorry I dont usually post so this might be kind of sloppy. for starters, I am not going to kill myself. I care too much about other peoples feelings. And my cats. But all my mind can think of is how nice it would be to be dead. Ive been depressed like this one other time in my life, but this is the first time I have seriously considered self harmI guess as a way to escape the internal pain? I havent taken any steps to self harm but I have a strong urge to do so. I just want everything to end. I have no drive to do anything. Im irritable as fuck. Nothing is going right and even if it was I probably wouldnt acknowledge it. Idk how to get out of this mindsetI have absolutely no urge to change anything, which is what everyone keeps telling me to do. Ive tried to look for psychiatrists and psychologists but its super fucking hard in this mental state and theres a shit ton of steps to just get on the waiting list, and finding someone who takes my insurance etc.... My question is whether or not this is still considered suicidal, even though I know I wont end my life, I would just like to. Anyone else experience this?",

    "How to come back? Around the middle of 2020, I had a huge mental breakdown like I never had in my life, isolated myself, move out of the city for emotional and financial reasons, and shut down communication with my friends. Wont tell the whole story here, as I already posted it, but after treatment and just passing time Im now ready to go back to the city, but the idea of confronting my friends and their questions spikes my anxiety. It is obvious theyre going to ask WTF happened to me, why did I disappear, what have I been doing and honestly I dont know what the fuck am I going to do. Some of my closest friends were trying to reach me out while I was in the middle of my breakdown last year, and when I finally spoke to them and told them what happened they were understanding, but THEY ARE my closest friends. I feel like I can share ugly, intimate details with them. I dont know if I can do that with other people. I cant imagine myself being at a party or something and telling everyone I had a chill gap year I wish. I cant lie. And yet I want to not give a fuck about what other people think, I dont want their opinions and their fake sympathy cause they never called, and will never call after this. I sometimes wish I was more of an asshole and straight tell them its none of their business and I dont feel like talking about it with them, but thats not me, although being honest the breakdown and the pandemic made more cold and bitter so I dont know On the other hand, I wonder if some of them are mad because I gave zero explanations for my disappearance?

    "My [23f] boyfriend [24m] has severe depression and I don't know what to do. Help For some context, Ive been dating my boyfriend for a little over a year now. He told me early on that he has severe depression but hes working to get better. I have never personally dealt with mental illness before, at least not as severe as he has. Needless to say, dating someone with severe mental illness is a lot of weight to bear, especially since Ive never dealt with anything like it before. I do love him, but sometimes dating him is exhausting because I never know whether its going to be a good day or a bad day. Maybe hes bipolar, but I dont think hes diagnosed. Ive done everything I can to help him feel better when he has depressive episodes, but sometimes it feels like he doesnt tell me everything so I cant do much to help. When I try to help, he just acts hopeless, like nothing is going to get better. I worry that this will spiral into unhealthy territory maybe it has already. Ive contemplated breaking up with him but I know it would destroy him  perhaps to the point of self harm or worse. What can I do better to help him, or should I break up with him?",
    "I broke up wit my long distance fiance. Weve been dating for 2 years. Its our anniversary today. Hes in another country and he visited me once, a year and a half ago. He stayed for 2 weeks and weve only just been talking online after that. He has always had a problem of me having a different opinion from his. We have different views about things and I dont mind it, but it annoys him. He said I think hes stupid because I dont believe him. Believing him means agreeing with him. I held on because hes my first boyfriend and we didnt have any problem when he was here. He has good qualities and I chose to focus on those instead. However, we had a big fight today and I realized its gonna be hard living together if he cant even agree to disagree. Im so heartbroken. He has been my pillar for so long. I was in the dark before I met him. Now Im back in the dark. Ive been crying the whole day.",

Aunt and I wanted to have fun with her new card game. She does that in the hopes hell get the hint hes being an ass. Rather than saying were trying to have a nice day. She used to say something, only for dad to explode claiming he wants to talk politics and if we dont like it tough basically. He finally got the notion after 3 hours of being a douchebag to talk almost anything else with aunts husband. He does this because no one else wants to talk polotics or go off the handle about pretty technical mondane and boring javascript issues.

    "I just want to quit everything and say @&amp;*% it, need advice Long story 20yo, 3rd year in college and having a very rough patch. I was one of those gifted kids that never studied which started biting me in the butt once I got to IB high school. Got burnt out before I even got to college. Had issues with depression in high school as well. Fast forward to today and this semester isnt even half way over and Im pretty sure Im going to fail 46 of my classes, I have no motivation to do anything nor can I make myself care about not failing exams. I would hate the professors but I just feel too exhausted to give a crap about them. Half the time I dont show up to classes, even the ones I liked at the beginning of the semester, and when I do show up Im sitting staring at a wall or rewatching a dumb video on reddit or instagram or whatever. Ive regularly had suicidal thoughts since high school about jumping off a parking garage or crashing my car but I know Ill never do it because of my family and my pet and responsibilities or whatever. I know I need to work at it and all but I cant seem to find the light at the end of the tunnel. I can feel anxious about failing a class but I cant bring myself to really care about it. My best friend says Im just burnt out and my therapist is considering medication. I just dont know what to do or how to get past just pushing through and get to living for myself. Not sure if this all made sense. TLDR lack of motivation doesnt even come close to describing how I feel about life. Not sure if medication helps this or not and could use some advice in general on how to get through depressive episodes.",
    "Why can't depression ever be gone forever? Hi, sorry i still dunno how reddit work yet. I just joined and its my first time talking about such stuff online. Ive been diagnosed with depression and few other stuff few years ago and i had treatement and such until i felt better but whenever i got into an argument with family i could feel it crawl back in me. Up until now Ive been strong enough to overcome those small situations. And even tho i feel better most of the time i can feel it whenever im sort of reverting back to it. Like i start to go out less and less, i stop talking to people online and irl and answering the phone becomes a hard task.. then i start to distract myself by bingewatching shows so i dont leave space to thinking, i dontcant sleep at night and i have a hard time remembering things i just did or dont realize Ive done them. And i like reading but it becomes hard like i cant focus and i end up skipping lines or read without rememberingunderstanding what i just read. The more i stay home the harder it is to get out. Anyway thats how i know shit is getting serious. Other than that i sometimes have a hard time swallowing food the doctor said it was anxiety a lack of magnesium and having supplements did help but anyway. Two days ago came back home i was in a good mood i brought sweets for everyone at home except i fould out novody was there. I have a kitten at home i brought it recently about two months ago. its 5 months old and it still pees in the wrong spots when its far from its litter. The past few weeks it peed 3 times on my blanket and i had to take it get cleaned everytime. I barely got to use it so this time i had put it in a closed room so the cat cant get to it. But a cousin of mine opened the room to feed the cat there and my father had taken away the litter out of the room because thats what he does .. whatever he likes basically. Anyway when i came back i found the door open and pee on the blanket that i had just taken out of from cleaning a night before and put aside away from the cat but there it was dirty again. I got mad.",

    "Losing myself in tv and phone games Logically I know I need to put my energy towards productive or positive things more and not wreck my brain with hours of passive tv and phone games. Because living here at my parents is dangerous for me. Ive become too comfortable I guess because I dont want to feel anxiety again, and I stay in a really small box. I dont even smile much,make eye contact or spend time with family because my nervous system and brain cant handle the unpredictability of interactions with them, needing to be on the defense so they cant affirm my negative fears about myself and my future. I used to be outgoing and extremely energetic and passionate about life. Then trauma hit and I dont have the energy to afford to spend on things that dont earn me health or money. Not proud but its true and if you can relate then you understand what I mean. If youre financially dependent on other people your very health and future hangs in the balance of other peoples whims and no good things can be trusted until there is income, because every good interaction eventually has a circumstance where someone makes an offer and I cant say no because Im under their thumb. I need a job that requires very little emotional energyfaking happiness, and requires more problem solving or physical labor. I never got proper schooling or job training, worked mostly on organic farms but now I want to pursue income that is compatible with my post trauma body and brain. Im afraid that my world has become so small and limited compared to what it needed to be, and I need to expand it again. I practice yoga, meditate, cook, walk in nature a lot, dropped all unhealthy habits except the tv and phone. Im still not happy and feel terrible to not know what direction I should be devoting all my energy to, to break me out of this sad sad hole asap. TLDR what would you do in my limited position to save yourself from negative coping habits of zoning out with tv and phone games? Im totally fine with moving by the way. I just cant afford it yet",

    "I feel like I don't deserve to be sad, but I am. I understand this may seem silly. Everyone has their own issues and struggles, their own obstacles and problems, etc. But I truly have a very blessed life, I am attending college, living with my father he and his wife have very respectable income. I do not have to pay rent, I have an abundance of friends who care about me a lot, I have hobbies that I excel in, I am at least relatively proactive in taking care of myself eating breakfast, lunch dinner, exercise, etc., I dont partake in selfdestructive behaviors examples smoking, drinking, etc. So why do I feel sad? More importantly, why do I feel GUILTY for feeling sad? I look around and see people in situations light years worse than mine, and that is a big part of why I find it so hard to talk about this. I start to feel down and I want to speak up but my down is just the majority of the norm for some people, and I feel like I am unable to be taken seriously because of this. But even more than just worrying that other people will not take me seriously, I feel like I can not take myself seriously, and it feels beyond pathetic. I hate myself so much when I watch people in terrible situations still trying their best to do the best for themselves and others around them. I feel like I have such a golden opportunity at life yet Im just wasting it in self sorrow and self pity. This realization has pushed me to an extent. Like I said, I have hobbies that I excel in, I go running and try to take care of myself the best I can. I do my best to help around when I can, be a contributing member of communities and generally just be nice. Yet I still find myself feeling like its not enough and that Im just not worth it. How am I supposed to work on my problems when I dont even know what they are anymore? Im at a very low point in my life. I manage to put on a strongfront for my friends and family, and dont get me wrong, I am truly happy on a respectable amount of days.

    "Should I get myself checked in to a psychiatric ward so they can force me to start my antidepressant? The more scared I get the worse my anxiety gets. The worse my anxiety gets the more I get scared, and it gets even harder to start my medicine. Lately I havent been able to think about anything else other than my bowel issues, I cant even watch a youtube video. Im not suicidal I have suicidal thoughts yes but I havent made any plans, and I have things I want to do, you know? I dropped out of college, and I want to go back. Im not even exaggerating when I say this I see myself going back to school literally every night in my dreams. I have gender dysphoria, and I want to at least know how it feels like to be comfortable in your own body. And these things keep me going. But I also know that I have to take my medicine, and I just dont know how I can do that. I thought of a couple things that I can try. First, I can get myself checked in to a psychiatric ward. Make them force me to take my medicine. There are several upsides and downsides with that. If I get an anxiety attack they can intervene. I will be forced to take the medicine, so it has a higher probability of success. But on the other hand, the psychiatric wards in my country have some problems. Ive read a lot about human rights violations, abuse, mistreatment, violence etc. And Im sure you can understand, I dont need this stuff on top of my problems. Also since Im not a danger to myself or to others they might not even accept me. Also my parents will probably be very angry with me, because I dont look very nervous or stressed from outside. Second, find a way to start taking them on my own. I can ask to start from a lower dose. My psych wanted me to start at 150mg. Effexor XR is available with dosages as low as 37.5mg. I can ask for anti anxiety medication. I have anti nausea medication, and I can take that while starting.",

I really only want to have sex with someone Im really emotionally attached too, and I also want my first time to be with someone else who hasnt done it yet. I kinda just assumed that sex would come in its own time until I broke up with my girlfriend about a month ago, where now Im being told that I should avoid relationships for the sake of my mental health. She was also the one who demeaned me for not having had sex before and sorta the reason I need it to be someone elses first time too. She basically made fun of me for not having had sex before, and I never really cared about losing my vcard, but now Im thinking about how belittled I feel knowing that I havent had sex whereas many of my friends have and now I notice all of them sorta expect me to have it as well, and even though I want it to be special and real they still see me differently for not having had it some contextmy friends are also fucking nerds and it is beyond me how any of them have had sex yet.

    "Should I feel like a loser Basically the title. Im 21F, and going to post my life story I guess. Thank you for any advice, or just being honest. I feel like a failure. Ive never had a job. Even in high school I just wanted to focus on doing good in school, not splitting my time for some minimum wage fast food job, but I guess everyone else in the world already had a job in high school. I still dont have a job, have never tried to applyget an interview, and now I feel like I dont even have time for one. Im going to be in college full time again next month, I dont drive anymore, I just dont see the point. Should I be even more miserable and have less time for school just so I can finally check the box of having a job? I dont drive anymore. I did it everyday for 2 years with no real problems but then the stress wasnt worth it anymore. I hate the gravel roadspotholes of this town, hate driving on ice for 10 months of the year, I just dont ever want to deal with the stress again. Ive lived with my parents ever since the pandemic, and of course not being able to drive makes me feel like I dont have any agency or independence. Cant go to school or a job because I feel like a huge burden and failure whenever I ask them to take me anywhere. I dont have any friends and dont really feel worthy enough to have any, but Ive accepted that for a while. I feel so ugly and worthless and I think any reasonable person would probably agree. I have nothing to offer. I guess Im going to email a therapist again soon, even though I have no health insurance and certainly dont have the money to just spend. I was trying to save my student loan money but I dont even know what the point is anymore. Thanks for reading. Just really not enjoying anything lately, and I cant really get out into the world at all because theres no inperson classes, nothing to do, and I feel like a burden every time I ask for something from my parents when theyre working.",
    "Random questions I want to start by saying some of these questions might be dumb but Im American and poor. So Ive avoid healthcare like the plague because it can ruin your life just the same. Who do I see to get on depression meds. I need to see a general doctor for something not depression related. Can they also prescribe depression meds? Do I need to see a psychiatrist? Do doctors normal prescribe meds on first visits or do they want you to try anything else first?",
    "I'm looking for advice on helping my depressed and, as I've just learned, suicidal grandma. So long story short, my grandma is an alcoholic, shes depressed, and shes revealed to me today that she wishes she was dead all the time. Shes tried for a long time these help herself, to get out of her addiction to alcohol and cigarettes, but she really cant do it herself. She fell today and has multiple times before after drinking heavily, and it took a while to get her back up due to her obesity. This was when she told me she wishes she was dead. I told her that she doesnt wish that and shes not thinking clearly because shes drunk, and she told me she feels the same way when shes sober. I know that to have suicidal thoughts, you arent thinking clearly by definition. I didnt explain that to her though. A lot of my family struggles with addiction and depression, and Id say my grandma is in a better state than most of them. Im curious what steps anyone here has taken in getting a family member the help they need. What resources are available to me and how do I help someone who is fortunate enough to at least want to help themselves? Thank you in advance.",
    "Quit my new job Managed to find a job after awhile of searching. Ended up quitting my second day because everything just became too overwhelming. Every single thought about work I blew out of proportion, giving me panic attacks and suicidal thoughts. Im so ashamed, Ive done this before, I just cant hold a job because Im fucked up. The job itself wasnt really difficult, but thinking about it and dealing with my colleagues made me want to stop living. Im trying to tell myself that maybe I need more time to work on my issues, maybe Im still not ready. But who knows when I will be if ever. I dont know if I can ever cope with work and if I cant then whats the point?",
    "Why do I have sudden \"bursts\" of depression I know the title probably doesnt make sense but I stopped working for a while to peruse a business idea i had which failed and now Im about to go back into the work force Im only 19 and I have these moments where i just feel lost and like I failed my family and friends as my business is what i dedicated my life to for the past 6 months and most of that time was me sitting in my room trying to get it off the ground floor. Im really nervous about getting a job again as i havent had a real one that entire time am I just overthinking it or will it be not as bad as i think.",
    "Advice? Hi, In advance! Im not the best out there on explaining my feelings since thats very far away from my culture, but Ill try because I dont know what else to do. Im 26 and not too long ago I changed my career path to something which Ive always wanted to do. Prior to this, which was about a year and a half ago I felt as though Ive been in an emotional hole I couldnt get out of. My new job distracted me for a long while, I was even being complimented on how I suddenly seemed like myself again up until about 6 months ago, when I just fell back in to my own bullshit of complete and utter numbness. The issue is, that normally lasts a few weeks for me but its been 6 months or longer now and I cant seem to shake it. I dont want to speak to anybody, I love my family and friends but I cant seem tomake the effort I guess? This resulted in me losing important connections and even severing them because I cant for the life of me understand what the point of them is when I cant be a good person to them. Then I have the audacity to feel loneliness and feel even more sorry for myself  When I do talk to the people I have left I cant focus on the conversation and I just drift off in to absolutely nothing, so it never lasts long. My question is to those who have managed to get through this without medication I cant have medication due to the nature of my job How did you manage to do it? Am I missing something? I will do everything I possibly can to help myself but Ive tried so much. I got back in the gym, Im eating well, Ive meditated, Ive gone for walks, Ive listened to music to self medicate, Ive slept decent amounts. I cant seem to enjoy doing anything anymore and my passion for life has been put out like someone suddenly pissed on a bonfire. I feel like I get closer and closer to giving up everyday and Im just too close to it this time to the point Im starting to scare myself every now and again with the thoughts that come in to my mind. Any suggestions would help so much.",
    "I’m a high school senior and I’ve officially lost everything I’ve had to look forward to Im 17 years old from Texas, in my senior year of high school and after working so hard and having some of the hardest years of my life through high school I was really looking forward to seeing all my hard work pay off, but now Im not getting that opportunity just like so many others. When the whole corona virus stuff started I never though it would hit this close to my home and that it would have this big of an impact on everything, I had already paid for my cap and gown and had my senior pictures done and even my invitations were ready to go but now the pictures and invitations are all in a box in my parents closet. I think the worst part about this is that no one seems to care and when its brought to their attention all they have to say is some shit like Oh sorry, life happens what the hell am I supposed to do with that? I worked so hard to keep my depression under control but this has just put me at a whole new low and I dont know whats going to happen to me if I cant find some help from someone soon..

    "Questions for people who were haunted with regret with fucking up with a girl years ago/failing to find someone new to make you feel the same way/better. Right in this moment, when you are feeling haunted, what are some effective things to tell yourself to shake this off? Fucked up with 18 year old girl who liked me when I was 18. I was very attracted to her and was filled with all sorts of the bondingchemicals and emotions of an 18 year old. Thinking about her voice or what it was like when she was near me still gives me chills. A bit less than 10 years from that now, Im getting back into dating and trying to find someone who can give new experiencesbetter experiences and put these feelings of regretbeing haunted to rest. ampx200B Its a bit hard to forgive myself for fucking up with her. And hard to face the possibility that I may have missed a once in a lifetime opportunitythinking things are downhill from here on. Hopefully those thoughts prove to be false but it doesnt help that the feeling of presence and her voice seem to be much bettermore intense than with people I can be with now... for now. ampx200B By haunted, this is what I mean sometimes in my daydreaming, Ill see images of her that feel very real, almost like shes in the same room with me and I feel some strong chemicalsemotions. I feel an intense feeling of longing and hate for myselfreality that I didnt pull through almost ten years ago. In this exact moment, Im trying to think of some good mental strategies to shake this off and avoid the depression that follows it. What might you tell yourself in that exact moment? ampx200B Stuff Ive tried  telling myself things will be better in the future that will help me forget gt but this could be true or could be false, Id give it 5050, but telling myself this hasnt seemed to help  telling myself everything happens for a reason gt er well um things happen because of cause and effect, not exactly sure there is a dude orchestrating everything with a good intention  trying to distract myself gt trying to make this work, ex trying to do a physical location change if possible not always possible .

    "NSFW// i don’t know what to do TW! im severely depressed and i dont have enough confidence or will to reach out to anyone. partly because im a therapist friend and in the past when i have reached out im met with jokes amp not being taken seriously. my perfectionism is killing me. today my friend told me their mom physically assaulted them last night and all morning ive been stressing out, trying desperately to help them i started creating a care package for them with a handmade necklace and their favourite things. they have a broken knuckle, bruises everywhere, a black eye, migraine then i realised they would never do this for me, because theyve been one of those people to make jokes. i tell them im upset and crying, they say hi upset im name. stupid, very childish jokes. and it isnt that i need better friends.. they arent a bad friend. that advice just isnt what i need right now, im lucky to have friends at all. because if they were a bad friend then everyone i know would be a bad friend, its been like this my whole life maybe i try too much for others and in return expect too much, but i just want someone to be there for me. i wish i didnt have to tell them how to be there, i wish they just did it out of genuine care. it wouldnt matter whether it actually helped or not because even seeing effort would be everything to me. the biggest problems i normally get to talk about is annoyances throughout my day and after a while ive given up on reaching out because it falls flat. the people that say theyre there for me dont listen. after years of this i just dont know what to do, im so tired it probably doesnt help that i most likely have autism and what typically comforts people usually doesnt comfort me. i take things very literally and dont understand 90 of peoples jokes even when i can recognise them as a joke. so maybe they say these things to make me feel better but to me it feels horrible, and ive told them that and i try to be serious but i feel like my communication just falls on unwilling ears. idk... i just feel so alone and ill take whatever i can get",
    "Struggling So I have always struggled with depression but after I had met my husband 8 years ago I started doing really well and for the most part didnt have depression. We were always doing stuff to keep busy and keep my mind off the stuff that would bring me down. Well fast forward to now and I am just feeling at the end of my rope. My health took a 180 about two years ago and I now struggle with quite a few health problems that keep me from doing the things I use to do. I cant even do simple things that a lot of people take for granted. And now I see what toll it is taking on my husband to have to take care of me so much and it kills me. He has become so short and angry at the world and has made comments that make me feel like I am to cause for all this. I am sure that is not how he feels just how it makes me feel I just wish I could make all the pain and hurt go away. I feel myself slipping further and further away and I dont know how to cope anymore. Just wish I could quit feeling like this all the time. Any Advice would be greatly appreciated.",
    "16 year old struggling with depression and drugs Hey guys, Im 16 years old and I have had alcohol a few times, and it used to be somewhat of a problem for me. When I was 15, I only had alcohol about once a month, but I always fantasized about it, and when I had it, I tried to have a lot. I was really really depressed back then, and I have tons of selfharm scars and a few suicide attempts. And now, Ive gotten extremely depressed again. My exbest friend really victimized herself and said terrible things to me, stuff like that our whole friendship was based on lies and that Ive hurt her in ways that she couldnt imagine. This is due to lies that her abusive boyfriend had been feeding her, and he is a really bad person and talks trash about her so much and spills her secrets and doesnt have morals. I snapped when she was saying some really hurtful stuff to me and I told her everything her boyfriend did, which I think led to her saying those even more mean things to me. She ended up basically blocking me on everything. I went to a party yesterday and she was there and I felt so disconnected and lonely, and I vaped for the first time in a while, and there was a box cutter and I went to the bathroom to cut myself and I just felt so much better. Ive also been fantasizing about alcohol so that I could stop feeling. i have tons of goals for college and life, and I dont want to sound stuck up but I have pretty good chances at a top 10 college if I keep what I have going. But this has really clouded me, that someone who knew so much about me just rejected me like that and treated me like that and I just want to stop feeling. Does anybody have any advice? P. S. I promise that I wont be pming anyone to stop me from harming myself or anything like that. I would really appreciate real, actionable steps that can help me just forget about this situation and go back to working hard. For example, Ive heard that meditation could be really beneficial, and has anyone here tried it?",

    "I got cheated on by my now ex-boyfriend of six years and I feel worthless I didnt know because he never opened up to me even when I asked. He then proceeded to ask if I wanted to join him on trip which just took place this Monday through Wednesday. In that moment I got angry. How could you tell me to go on this trip when you just told me you didnt love me? It wasnt logical. We argued and towards the end he said he was done. I asked him to clarify and he needed some space from me. Fine. I let him be until he contact me on Sunday the 10th wanting to meet up the following day. We didnt end up meeting up on Monday and did a follow up instead on Tuesday. We talked. I was worried for him. I told him that people were concerned for his safety and he just laughed it off with the laugh of a maniac. He said that why did people care. He was so distant. Before I left I asked again where we stood. And he told me to give some time. I asked for how long and he told me he would let me know. Fast forward to this Monday. He told me to have any false hope of getting together. We went on our trip and I noticed he was texting a lot while trying to angle himself to hide his phone. It was something I noticed right away. We moved on through the day. We got to our destination. While laying down on my bed he came laid down next to me. It was odd because he didnt want to be close to me previously. We went about our day. Came back to our Airbnb and as I was laying down again he came into my room again and fell asleep next to me. After our naps we went out to explore the town. Had a couple drinks went back to our Airbnb and ended up sleeping together. The day of the concert having woken up from a hangover we just stayed in had some breakfast and watched the hearing. We eventually got ready for the event we were in town for. We ended up getting to the venue early enough where the line was already forming.",

    "I've been feeling this way for some tine Im alway feeling like this. It doesnt even matter the age we are anymore. When we are feeling low its just that. Ive been dealing with depressionanxiety since I was 1213. It comes with just a long story that I was never able to overcome it. I tried to seek help and when she tried to suggest medication since I was already angry I just never went back. I just got to a point where I just say Im ok when asked HOW ARE YOU? Its just easier to say Im ok, than explaining how I feel. night time is the worst for me since Im alone in my room. Ive tried to text people that I was once able to do, but that turned out wrong for me so I guess I dont have that option anymore. Ive done things in the past where I am trying to avoid but as selfish as that may sound to others I found my comfort in that. I dont want to do that anymore. Finally admitted to myself that I cannot do this anymore by myself. This whole year has been a night mare for me but I still tried and I feel like kept falling deeper and deeper. Like being in a coma but with my eyes open. Like being in a crowded room and yet Im still feeling alone, boxed in, no way out. Ive become so afraid of being alone, that I am alone. Lost valuable friends, a great partner and I cannot get any of it back. I held back on telling people how I feel with the fear of losing anyone else. But that hold inside me makes it worse and I know that, but I dont want to lose anyone else. I dont know if I would, but that thought is just there. I feel as if I sleep walk awake. Sorry it just been to much. My heart beats fast, with just even writing this my head hurts from it all. I want to tell people how I feel the ones matter, but its that fear that hold me back. Dont know why or where this all came from but its been even harder to get myself together. Maybe I deserve to be alone. I deserve to not have you as my friend.",
    "I need help to help a friend... I have a friend teenager, he is good at anything specifically, he doesnt have hobbies, nor does he have anything he wants to do... and naturally depression kicked in, noone noticed for a while, I personally found out about it being serious just about... 3, maybe 4? hours ago... he sent me a message saying bye, im suiciding which on its own, with no context, seemed as a stupid stupid joke... so naturally I said that this isnt a topic to joke about, and eventually put some things together He doesnt have hobbies  goals, He smokes recently started which is horrible imo, he drinks , and he was known to have been overly depressed before, but nothing came out of it, it seemed like he had a rougher time with small things, I started to get worried so I digged deeper... talked with a few common friends and only 1 was able to be of help, the friend suicidal had plans... everything. step. by. step. It was actually pretty .... yikes idk... scary, and I got to talk with him, explained to him as nice as one could, that he needs, and he agreed, and said, what about telling your parents? they sure will helped. what followed had me mute. litterarly. HE DID! and his dad is an alchoolic that doesnt care, overall a cool guy to have a drink with and have some fun talk, but not a dad. for sure not. and his mother seemed really active and protective, which she isnt... he told his mom about his issues, and she said well you better get on studying and stop with this bad word poopoo . Which pretty much dug him even further into the hole he is in, I cant help but want to do something, I wont be telling his parents more because I am afraid that he will be punished for speaking his problems out loud, which is wrong, but keeping in mind his parents, not surprising, anything I can do for him?!?",
    "Both me and my spouse are depressed To sum things up, my husband works in retail, Im disabled and cant get disability pay, were poor, but getting by, neither of us have any schooling nor can afford it, he doesnt know what he wants to do if he does go to school, while I feel if I decide to go, it would be a waste of money because I wont be able to work. Plus, theres no guarantee Im mentally fit for it. Neither of us have any drive or passion for life and the only thing really keeping both of us going is each other. Were both obese because hes too tired after work to do anything and my condition is sporadic so its unsafe for me to walk alone. Neither of us even want to go anywhere, anyways. We eat for comfort or when were bored and neither of us can really muster the effort to make food a lot of the time so we subsist on junk. Little things tire us out easily me from my condition, but us both from depression. Im diagnosed and receiving treatment, he isnt. Because of the pandemic, therapy for me is spotty at best  just went three months without therapy and had my first session last week, but my therapist missed our last session earlier this week, so Im worried shes sick again. Getting my husband in for therapy or psychiatry right now is impossible. New patients arent being accepted because paperwork needs to be signed in person. We do have a dog, but he fits in with us way too well. Our dog is afraid of the outside if hes out more than 10 minutes, then demands to be picked up or he wont move. He enjoys car rides and likes being held for walks but my back and heart cant take the position, and he doesnt want my husband to hold him  hes my velcro dog. Then if there are any people, dogs, noises, or wind, he starts to panic, so I do too, he usually helps stabilize my moods, but were both afraid of people so it turns into a feedback loop.",

Honestly, my mom is the only person that shows me any kind of affection, and it makes me just want to be at home all the time, even though I have friends, they are not really people who I can depend on.

    "I don't know what's hit me today. Feeling hazy, disconected, lethargic. a malaise fog. Was ok, yet rediculously iritable on thursday even though I loved my workout. I dont know whats hit me today. Feeling hazy, disconected, lethargic. a malaise fog. Probably some of it from Methocarbamol Uses, Dosage amp Side Effects  Drugs.comhttpswww.drugs.commethocarbamol.html because I had slept in a shape sort of like a pretzel wensday after the gym. But today just have had no energy, uncomfortably disoriented to which in of it self is concerning. Binged a bunch of cookies listening to a hillarius rifftrax. And thats also frustrating because its so counter productive to getting weight down. Felt upset and weepy at how out of shape Ive gotten. One therapist thinks welbutrin would help, that does a number on my GI and makes me physically tense. My main one is at a loss. I really want to get recharged so as I can get back to planet fitness, and just out of the house. Im also so over these moodswings.",
    "Tale as old as time: live-at-home, depressed 30 year old with no job. My 20s are gone. Are my best years behind me? Ive been severely anxious and depressed for half of my life. I was diagnosed as bipolar a few years ago since two of the most insane experiences of my life ie hypomanic episodes that led me to do things that have left me traumatized. Ive basically been just existing. Not truly living, but not committed to killing myself. Just an animal that wakes up, eats, and repeats. On the upside, Ive recently committed myself to change. What inspired me to write this was a post I saw on Reddit asking 30 year olds to give advice to people in their 20s. As I start a new and, hopefully, more positive chapter in my life, I realize my 20sthe period that most people hold up to the light and call the most experimental, adventurous, and free time of their livesis gone for me. For me, my 20s was filled with a tremendous amount of fear and sadness. As I enter my 30s, theres more pressure than ever to have accomplished something adult. People are getting married, buying houses, getting promotions, switching careers... I have no idea who I am. My personality has withered away. The weight thats been on my chest is only just lifting, and all that time that others have had to explore and discover themselves is gone from me. Now, its time to put on a tie and plunge myself into the rat race. I feel cheated, behind, and angry. Can anyone relate? How do you think differently? More optimistically? Am I wrong about this?",

    "Everyone ghosting after some time Hey, eh, life is shit. Whenever it goes good, in next few days sth shit happens. Now I dont want to even have good moments, because after them there are 2x more worse. Last few months I lost my job, ended weirdest relationship ever which I still miss, suspicion of stomach cancer. Everything at 21y old. Besides that my parents literally hate me and only few friends stayed with me, rest faded out because I wasnt going to drink vodkaalcohol almost everyday. And the worst part of last monthsyears are new peoole who I meet. Most of them were really cool, always said they will never ghost but after some time they were doing same shit, which fucking hurts when you get to know someone close. Now I feel like fucking shit, being on knees in front of toilet, vomiting blood, not having energy to go out, when few months ago I wanted to start marathon. Only positive side of last months is reducing amount of drugs throwing cigs, max few beers per month etc. And also withdrawing from being addicted to halcion. Now Im also really scared about university, because there wont be online lessons, but normal. And in current state its hard to go up from bed, not talking about living as normal student. Nothing on Earth basically makes me happy now, Im just living because Im too scared to end this? So I just let the life pass. But I will probably not live much longer naturally so. Even my psychologist postponed my visit over 2 weeks in currently worst part of my life. And my real friends are banter type so I cant talk with them about these topicsyes i tried ended bad I just want soneone to idk ask me whats up in my life, talk with me and say everything will be ok.

    "I feel depressed but feel like even more of a loser for feeling depressed. I have a stable job now, albeit not something i wanted to do nor do i enjoy. Everything good ive ever had in life including that job, and basically all other jobs ive had is pretty much because of my dad and my last name. All of my friends who started off with so much less and dealt with more pressing issues in life went on to do so much more. I feel pretty much hopeless in finding something that i really want to do or because im not like them. Im definitely not the smart one or the good looking one or the outgoingfunny one. Im the only one whose never really had a girlfriend. Im pretty much just the rich one who at the time was a pity friend of a few guys i knew my entire life and grew up with but a lot of the people I came across in both high school and college never really liked me, not because i was an ass im relatively quiet, but because i never fit into a lot of those circles because of this or that yet because my childhood friends were friends with those guys, i was kind of just a fringe guy to them and still am now that im home. Sometimes i think i put myself in the wrong groups of people in life because i didnt have the social skills to find my own. This whole idea of me not being good at anything worthwhile has really carried into my early adult life. Its to a point now where im afraid of failure more than anything. Im afraid of a lot. Ive been feeling depressed off and on since about July on this go around. I get discouraged probably way too easily. I also feel like a disappointment. Im afraid of telling people that im depressed or that i have struggled with depression in the past. It would disappoint my parents because theyve given me so much. It makes me feel pathetic that im depressed because of everything i was born into. Sometimes i would fight the notion that what i was feeling was actually depression given my situation, but that was always redirected to me just being soft or a pussy in my mind that made me feel even worse. Sympathy always makes me feel guilty, really no matter what its about.",

    "Losing all hope It cuts to the heart in a way that is not describable. I fall to my knees sobbing and begging the universe to give me a sign, ANY sign, that I should keep going, that there is something worth living for, that there is some meaning in this, that the pain will be worth it in the end. But there is no sign coming. And I look at the world and the enormity of suffering in other places, where children are slaughtered in wars, where women are beaten and raped, where people shoot up schools and kill kindergartners... I look at the people who COULD NOT get sober, at the people who COULD NOT get well, or the people who never had a chance to, because their life was randomly taken from them in a car crash or from cancer or some other bullshit reason. And then I think about the evolution of humankind. I think of all of the millions of creatures that evolved from reptiles to mammals to apes to hominids. At what point did homo sapiens become conscious beings? At one point did we discover sense of self? At what point did meaning begin to matter to us? For all of the many millions of beings that lived before that moment  they had no meaning or purpose. And they represent the VAST majority of the history of animals, of life. And that life? Only represents a tiny fraction of the history of this universe. There. Is. No. Meaning. There is no way to reconcile how some people have the chances and opportunities to grow and to get stronger, while others do not. There is no way to reconcile the fact that our suffering is a blip in comparison to the enormity of the universe and spacetime.",
    "What to do when you notice yourself slipping back into depression? Ive had depression from 20152017 but never went to therapy. It got better because of a good network of friends and living with someone who motivated and helped me get through it. Now I feel like Im slipping back into old habits. For context I had covid last Christmas. Since then I struggle with fatigue, tiredness, lung problems and my thyroid. I havent found a doctor that was able to help me yet. Everybody dismisses me because there is no cure for long covid symptoms. I got an asthma spray and thyroid medication but it doesnt help. It scares me so much. I tried to get back into fitness and train my lungs. Yesterday I couldnt even finish jogging for 1,5km. Im 24, F, normal weight. I feel like a failure. Because I cant even run for such a short distance. Also Ive been quarantining for the last two weeks and ate way too much. My medication also made me gain weight. I feel horrible in my body. And I feel weak because i cant fight it. My boyfriend always tells me Im strong because I gave it a try but I cant accept that Im chronically ill and suffer every day and there is nothing I can do about it. It got so bad during the quarantine that I couldnt let him kiss me because I didnt feel like I deserved him. At the same time I want to hide how I feel because Im scared he will get fed up if Im depressed all the time. Its like a self fulfilling prophecy. I just want to lay in bed all day, I am scared to go back to work, I think about eating all the time and there isnt much Im excited for because of covid. Does anyone have advice how to get out of this lump and motivate myself? I want to fight it but the only thing that comes to mind is sports and I cant really do that physically.",

Ive never had any real friends, never been in a relationship, im not close with any family members, and the only texts I receive are from my parents, which usually just keep mocking me for not having a girlfriend and asking when im finally going to go on my first date. When I was in high school I was addicted to pills, and I also developed an eating disorder, and nearly died twice. I remember spending time in mental hospitals, spending time in intensive care, etc., and the only person who even came to visit was my mother, who came once after an overdose, and she just said she was disappointed in me and grilled me about why I did what I did. In the past 3 months Ive lost 3 friends, one to suicide, one to a drug overdose, and one to cancer. I feel like im going to explode, and I dont know what to do, and I dont have anyone to turn to.

    "I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to keep going I posted yesterday, but things keep getting worse. So my spouse and I were given a 30 day move out notice because our depression mess was too much for them. Its not even thats bad, and weve been actively trying to get better, but they wouldnt work with us at all. My spouse called her mom today to wish her a happy birthday and her mom ended up asking a bunch of questions about our plan and what were doing, and my fiancée broached the subject of her possibly taking our cats. Her mom proceeded to freak out at her and say that she was being disrespectful and then yelled at my spouse for being manipulative when she started to cry. She then said that if we really cant find anything that we can move in with her, but obviously thats not something that any of us want. My spouse is currently sobbing in the bathroom, barely able to move, and I just feel so utterly fucking helpless and afraid. She told me that she wants to kill herself so fucking bad but that she cant because that would be unfair to me. I worry every fucking day that this will be the day that her will to live outweighs that guilt she feels for leaving me. I have for a long time. I used to come home when I worked an earlier shift from her and check the closet to make sure I didnt find her hanging there, and that was even when things were going relatively okay. I dont know how were supposed to do this. How do we get an apartment if were being kicked out in the middle of our lease? No one will want us with this on our record. Im terrified of if we have to go to her moms. I would suggest that just she move back in because I think part of her moms issue is with me and I find a couch to crash on until we can figure it out, but I worry that her mental state would get worse being at her moms without me, dealing with her mothers emotional abuse every day. Im terrified. I feel like Im spiraling out of control. My spouses mental health is so much worse than mine so Im the one who always has to be strong and supportive, but Im losing it.",

    "Has anyone else experienced these symptoms? My depression has always been severe, and I experience most symptoms other than an increase in energy and appetite. The worst symptom I used to have was intense pain in my chest as if someone were trying to rip out my heart. However, I just had my worst depressive episode ever, and it lasted for about a month. My symptoms were 1. Feeling as if I weigh a ton, and have immense difficulty moving 2. Nausea 3. Aforementioned chest pain 4. Tunnel vision 5. Blacking out Every time the sun went down, and sometimes during the day, these symptoms would occur simultaneously and in very high intensity at the drop of a hat. I never felt it coming, it was like a switch being flipped, and then I would suddenly be filled with the worst dread I had ever experienced and feel my head floating away from my body from the sheer intensity of the depression. Im not necessarily looking for sympathy, I just need to know if anyone else has experienced this as Ive never heard of depression getting this bad and am wondering if something else may be wrong.",

This school year tenth grade my academics are horrendous. I have failed math in 23 terms 51 first term, dropped into 40s for 2nd term and my science grade was in the mid 60s for term 1 and i think i failed term 2.

My dad who has been apart of my whole life but not really at the same time because hes a drunk ashle is in critical condition and is dying.

    "Death anxiety got me feeling like life is pointless and exhausting and it's all a nightmare. Hello! So iv been depressed and anxious for a long time i think but recently i started having thoughts about death every single day and its like i opened pandoras box. Death is so final, so scary. It makes life seem pointless, why build something up when its just a matter of time before it all ends and how am i supposed to enjoy this experience with a metaphorical gun to my head that i dont know when it will go off? I tried looking at spirituality and stuff because nobody knows what happens when you die right? But it seems logical that we just die and the other stuff is wishful thinking... and even if there were an afterlife that would kinda subtract from the meaning of living this one. This is one big bad boogieman that no adult can come and safe me from and its horrible.... So today and yesterday i started having more thoughts about dying, yesterday i went snorkeling and had to quit because i kept thinking about drowning and how that would suck. Today i thought that i might as well die now since nothing matters and its an inevitability and im tired of fighting. But they are thoughts and i feel some distance between me and the action. I still rationally think that i might as well try everything, try to get better.",
    "Don't understand my depression 28 year old male here. Im having a bit of trouble expressing what my depression really is. To my therapist, my psychiatrist, my longterm boyfriend, hell even to myself. I dont want to kill myself, I dont want to die, I just want to not be... me. My selfesteem and confidence is zero, but I put on a happy face. Unfortunately Im funny, so when I finally express how Im really feeling it always comes at a shock. I cant take pictures of myself, I can barely look in the mirror, because I hate what I see. I was required to submit a picture of myself for university and literally had a panic attack. I always give seeminglyaccurate reasons about not posting anything on social media, and I finally came clean to my boyfriend that every reason I dont is because I cant stand myself, and to be honest, I dont think he understood. Hes always been supportive of me and helping me get the help I need, but I dont think he is able to empathize rather than sympathize. I have this selfdisgust and selfhatred. I dont want to see myself in pain or hurt myself, I just dont want to see myself. Im conflicted because one side of my brain I am able to logic my way out of some spiraling thoughts... thanks CBT therapy but the other is just so dark and unforgiving and unrelenting. I thought my meds were working, and I think they are. I think they finally allowed me to see this a bit clearer, but Ive really struggling since. The thing is  I want to get better.

    "What is wrong with me then she offered me a limited contract for 6 months and called it my second chance, proceeded to tell me that the units didnt say good things about me and then told me that Im empathyless and that people arent machines or objects. I then apologies and told her that my facial expression always gives a bad impression, but then she nodded and said no, its not because of that. I know its unprofessional but I started to cry after that because I couldnt hold it in anymore. Two Units for which I applied for, suggested that I should apply there. Ive gotten feedback that my facial expression is scary, that I should work on my structure and organisation and that I shouldnt do things that Im not allowed to do yet I tend to try and do as many things as i can so that the other nurses like me but Ive also gotten feedback that when I talk to patients, I give a soothing impression with my voice and with how patient I am. Ive been told that I look smart described that Im the Brain, and I always replied that in reality Im not smart at all and that I struggle with remembering things.

I feel so terrible, I already know Im the worst human ever but I do try my best to make people feel comfortable and welcomed.

Im lethargic, Im apathetic, Im never happy, but never sad either. I always feel like this crazy heavy weight on my chest like loneliness. I feel just so lonely in this world. And I have friends. I have very close friends and an ex girlfriend I get on very well with. But I just feel like Im everyones second choice. Im a really likeable guy. I havent found a single person who has any problem with me. Like everyone likes me. But I feel like no one truly loves me. My main thing is that I hate normalcy. I hate this feeling of okay. Yet thats what my whole life is right now. Im fairly good looking, Im not poor, Im not rich. Theres nothing special about my life. And thats what I hate. Im scared my future is me withering away into mediocrity. Id rather be sad than how I am now because at least thats something. I feel like Im depressed but at the same time I dont. I dont hate myself If anything Im narcissistic, I have a very high self esteem Depressed people usually hate themselves. I dont cut, I dont cry, I dont ever really have a mad breakdown. I always think about how Id kill myself but I know deep down Id never actually do it. Im none of that. But Im not happy either. Also, I lie a lot. I manipulate people close to me so I can get ahead. I always put myself first. Before anyone. Machiavellianism. Then again, I dont know if Im just exaggerating that to try seem edgy or different. Which I so crave to be. I dont know.

But sometimes she cant see whats proper to tell someone whos having a hard time. One week after, she broke the bond to a mutual friend whos also on the sick leave. Hes much much worse than me. Still ST took everything personal and got angry. Which was the thing our mutual needed to talk about  telling that the anger made her feel more anxious than supported. That has affected me as well. I have trustissues and now fear any moment what ST thinks  I usually please her. This is what the mutual friends also did, and this turned out bad. ampx200B Anyhow. ST invited me to celebrate christmas with her and her family. I told ST about me going in selfisolation  staying away from SoMe from mid Dec  untill ? ?.. This to focus on my health, selfhealing ability and take one little thing at a time. While also telling her thanks but no thanks about celebrating christmas. Still I felt I had to write her a message telling  this means I wont come for christmas, but thanks again, Because I feared she would be upset. Afterwards she textes me like... 4 times.. Messages likeHey, Im so worried, can you please answer me? EVEN thoug I told her that this selfisolation meant that I wouldnt have contact with people around me! Because that pushes me back. I then ended up pleasing her, messagin her in the end of Januray that Im recovering slowly and that, as promised, Ill get back when Im back again. Yesterday I saw her big brother on the street and I kinda had to say hello to him.",
    "everything is so painful My mental health has been at its lowest since August 2020. Its gotten even worse now. Im graduating from college soon and I dont know where to go or what to do. Ive contemplated suicide many times but Im scared of death. I barely eat. I hate everything about me. I hate my voice and my personality but I especially hate my body. I hate the person in the mirror. I hate how ugly I am. I just want to be slim and pretty. No one hates me more than I hate myself. I feel like human garbage. Like I dont matter at all. I think the world would be a better place without me. Im just wasting everybodys time. Im tired of crying my eyes out every day. Im stuck in this dark hole and I cant get out. Surviving is so difficult. I dont know what to do with myself anymore. I dont know how to talk about my feelings. Ive always been the person to bottle everything up. Ive never had the opportunity to talk about how I feel. Im not making sense at all. Everything is all jumbled up in my head. I wish the pain would just go away. I cant take it anymore.",
    "Experiencing sadness like never before So lately Ive been feeling really sad and really down, Id say its a mix of losing touch with someone I loved and that made me feel special, starting uni and just the whole covid situation not allowing me to be around friends for a while. Every so often, almost daily, I get really sad at night, I start thinking about all I lost and about all I cant have right now, regarding friends, I lose motivation for anything, dont wanna get up but also dont wanna stay in bed doing nothing, I just cant do anything and I have to force myself to go to uni and sketch a smile on my face so I dont worry the friends I made there. Its getting to the point where Id say its unliveble to have this feeling everyday, but I feel like I cant do anything about it, doesnt feel like my choice to be sad or happy anymore. If theres anything you guys would suggest to try and brighten up my mood Id love some help. Thanks in advance.",
    "Messed up college and now stuck in life. No idea how to get out of this hell. This has been very stressful. I tried two years of college but it was just way too heavy for me mentally. I thought I could handle it but I was absolutely wrong. Ive lost lots of credits and not even sure whether I can try again in the future. Im even too scared to call for information. My parents dont know about this. Not even my friends. Everyone keeps asking how Im doing in uni but I dont wanna be judged so I keep it to myself and say that everythings perfectly fine. Im planning to work this summer but no idea what Im going to do the next years. I dont want to be living paycheck to paycheck and struggling just because my depression messed up my future.

If it was possible I would just open my skull and pour some ice cold water. This has been going on for the last 8 years. I have always been an introvert but I am now having difficulty just thinking what to do next. I dont have a job and dont have any friends who are near to me. Everytime something bad happens I automatically try thinking of the worst possible consequences of my actions. I dont want this fear in my life. Also Im having difficulty doing normal things. I would keep procrastinating to avoid accepting the situation Im in and making things better. I have been thinking of suicide a lot these days but I know thats not the answer.

    "Things just keep getting worse Sorry this is so long. One thing after another just keeps happening to me.. Things have been really bad for several years. I lost a really great job and I havent been able to find another. Everyone says Im over qualified and wont stick around, or that Im great but they went with another candidate. Im facing eviction for the 3rd time in 3 years. Ive applied for aid with my county and state, but even though I started in May I havent gotten any help. Ive somehow managed to keep the electricity on until now. I previously owed the power company money and they spread the debt out over months. But this month I couldnt make my payment, so the payment arrangement was canceled and they said my electricity would be disconnected. I dont live in a state where they wont cut off your electricity in the winter, and there is no way I can come up with almost 800. I expect them to disconnect my service Monday morning. Im freaking out and cant sleep because Im afraid when I wake up the power will be off. I interviewed twice for an absolutely amazing job, and about 2 12 weeks ago they offered me they job. I got so excited because I thought things would finally start getting better. They said the offer was dependent upon passing a background check. Originally I was supposed to start Nov. 8. Background check took almost 2 weeks, then they said it was done and were talking about shipping me a laptop job is remote for out of state company. Then Friday they told me the background check had brought up some things that required additional information from me. I got a copy of the report and it shows 2 misdemeanor charges from 2019. I was pulled over and ticketed for not having insurance or current car tags cause I didnt have  for either. And I bounced a check that I wasnt able to cover. I was fined for both, but I havent had the money to make any payments on either. I was hoping this great job would let me take care of those. On the background check it says I was sentenced to jail  I wasnt, but might even been for failure to pay the fines.",
    "I’ve lost track of my life and I don’t know how to get it back RANTREQUESTING SUPPORT OR ADVICE Ive 24F been struggling with depression off and on for the past 6 years. My mood was getting better since I broke up with my exboyfriend a month ago, but recently I feel like Ive lost track of my life completely. The breakup was the fist time I choose my own needs above someone elses and it felt like a step towards freedom. Meanwhile Im kinda dating somebody I have an extremely strong connection with. Weve had a short but intense relationship in the past but lost connection. We started talking again right before I finally decided to breakup with my ex Ive considered it many times but never had the courage to actually do it. I strongly believe that talking to this person made me decide to breakup with my ex. Besides that it really feelsfelt like the universe wanted us to connect again in a romantic way. Weve been dating for the past 2,5 weeks and Ive never been this confused in my life. One day I feel so liberated, loved, happy and absolutely in love with the person Im dating. The next day Im full of guilt, confused about my feelings for my ex and extremely depressed again. Guilt because I feel like Ive done my ex wrong while I know I didnt. Our relationship was not equal and mainly based on me taking care of him financially and emotionally. I feel like I abandoned him and I hate myself for that. Confused because I miss him so much and still feel love for him and the person Im currently dating, both in a romantic way. Depressed because I dont know how to deal with these feelings and because I think I messed up again. I feel like my life is a constant pattern of failure and making bad decisions unconsciously. Im stuck and lost. I keep telling myself that the most important thing is to be happy on your own, that you dont need a significant other to be happy. I know I tend to start difficult and ambiguous relationships in order to avoid other complicated feelings I actually have to deal with like a breakup. Im very aware of my coping but at the same time I feel like I genuinely need to experience if a relationship with the person Im dating will work out or not.",
    "We were engaged. He left me for a 19 year old he has been talking to online for the past 3 months I stayed there with him from January to March 2020. He was extremely nice and romantic, I never felt so happy, he really was my soulmate. He was also a very emotional guy, wasnt ashamed of crying and showing his emotions towards me. He asked me to be his girlfriend the day after I got there and he cried when I said yes. I never expected what Ill tell next to happen though. On my last day there, his parents drove with us to drop me off at the airport, and he cried the whole way there. We spent some time by ourselves at the airport, and when the time came for me to go through security to go to the gates, he got down on one knee and asked me to marry him. I never expected that and I was just filled with happiness. Then I said yes but had to walk away, so yeah, even though it was a beautiful moment it was also very sad. I came back to Brazil and we just went back to our online relationship. He eventually came here on December 2020 and stayed until February 2021. We had an awesome time here, I took him to the beach, it was his first time seeing the ocean. Ill never forget his smile when we went in the water. So towards the end of his stay we sat down with my family and told them our plans. His parents would give us, as their wedding gift, one of the best immigration lawyers in the United States, so I could get a K1 Visa and get married there. We started the process, sent them a bunch of documents and were just waiting on the government to give us a feedback. This process is a bit slow now because of the pandemic, so we spent this whole year waiting. Now there comes the bad part of the story, that I never thought would happen. October 2021, the worst month of my life. Actually, I need to go back a little bit, to August 2021. There was this Brazilian girl that did a high school exchange at his city a few years back, 20172018. They only saw each other in person once at the time, had each other added on Snapchat ever since, but never talked.",
    "Could you read me? Since then it was just blocked from my mind. ampx200B At age ten, I didnt wanted to be known as a woman anymore. But my classmates didnt wanted to accept me as a boy. So I started to become very reclusive. Around that age I discovered horror films. And for the first time, I connected with male figures. It was Michael Myers, Freddy, leatherface. They seem to be treated just like me. And I started to wish to kill my mother. I would play with knives all the time, imagining to be a serial killer. It appeared to be my destiny. Next year, at 11, I receive the shocking news. My mother is pregnant, and the baby is a girl. I was indifferent to the girl until she was born. Im so ashamed by this but I desired to rape her many times. One day, it was perfect to do it. It was only me and her. It was until I looked to her face. She was just a baby, I couldnt do this to her. I cried so much and I promised to myself that I wouldnt ever cause any harm to that girl. Ever. So I started to repress my admiration for psychopaths, and told myself that I wouldnt ever kill anyone. It seemed like the right thing to do. And it was ampx200B When I was 13, I tripped to my grandmas house, just like every year. My cousin, who is one year younger than me, was, probably the only boy I ever know that didnt saw anything wrong with me or that way I was. Actually, I spent the best times of my childhood playing with him. But at 13, something changed. One day, we were together, watching a film. He started to touch my butt and I was uncomfortable, but somehow, I wanted that. He grabbed me and was trying to have sex. I denied several times but he was being violent, almost stroking me. Somehow I liked the violence. I was enjoying that way he was telling me to shut up. I consent to him so anal sex with me.",
    "I have lost all my friends and am stuck in a nightmare. I spent the last 45 minutes carefully putting together my story and tried to tell exactly what happened in the past year, but then the Reddit app decided to commit suicide before me and I am too furious to write all of this shit again, so Ill just get straight to the point I have lost all my friends. I get especially sad because even my best friend we have kissed several times... just doesnt care anymore. My mother doesnt support me at all. She even keeps insulting me and makes things a lot worse. I seriously dont want to live here anymore. Or even living in general, but thats not really the point of this sub. And my father? I dont even know his name. Absolutely no contact whatsoever. I have nobody. I get insanely sad when I see other people having a good time, because Im stuck in this nightmare of not having any social contact whatsoever. But hey, at least I mastered social distancing before this Corona thing happened and I have no problem isolating myself... cause thats exactly what I did for the past nine months or so. I dont even need an external trigger like seeing other people having fun and I just get tears out of nowhere and I constantly think about what has happened to me. I sometimes dont even go to school because I would see people which mean a lot to me but treat me like a peace of garbage. I am terrible at school.

    "I'm so useless that my psychiatrist doesn't want to see me. I have this horrible self esteem issues and Im very self conscious about myself. I have a very plumpish figure, i compensate the lack of exercise with IF and calorie count. The reason why theres a lack of exercise is due to insecurity, embarrassment and fear. The fear of people making fun of me, judging me while I clumsily exercise and get out of breath. My psychiatrist has been trying and trying to push me. Questioned me if it really matters if they judged, when my health is concern. I know whats right and whats wrong. I know that it shouldnt matter. I know that my health is much more important than what others think. I just cant manage to bring myself to do it. Its a struggle. He lost it and calmly said he wont see me until I do something. After the appointment I left and I head to the restroom and bawled my eyes out. Hes somebody dear to me, and I always look forward to seeing him every week. Im so useless that i am unable to muster the courage to exercise to the extent of him not wanting to see me. I am beyond useless and hopeless. Its better to die than to confront the person who listens to you when you have let them down. Its tiring.",

    "I need help saving a friend So yesterday, my best friend told me straight up that she plans on taking her life some time in the future, and obviously I tried to do everything in my power to convince her not to, but its not working. She says that she doesnt want to be alive anymore and that she doesnt want to know what her future holds, and shes tired of it all. Basically she doesnt have the will to live anymore because she doesnt feel like anything in her life is paying off or is worth living for anymore. And to give a quick backstory, we had a friend that took his life two years, and she was heavily affected by it because he was her soulmate, and I feel completely powerless for not being able to do anything, its a terrible feeling.

I failed to become a good son, friend, brother, grandson or colleague. I have become more secretive from last 2 years. I eat secretly, want to live secretly deleting my pictures from social media. I sometimes think If my parents die then I would have no one to answer and then I can live this miserable life for long. I dont think about my future at all. I have not reached the suicide point yet but I think this is how you reach there eventually. I cant imagine myself having a simple life with family and kids and work.

Throwaway Account Ive been depressed for several years now and because I have a hard time feeling any emotions at all I just pretend to and play along for the majority. I am not actively suicidal anymore but I still think about it daily and I cannot shake the automatic ... guess I can always kill myself. Only my best friend who is in a similar state of mind knows how I feel and the rest of my friends and family have no idea and I dont want to tell them for several reasons. I live with my SO and we have been living together for 2 years now. I think she knows that I am feeling blue a lot but I am certain she doesnt know how severe it is. Recently I have been thinking about how I could start a conversation if I chose to do so but I dont know how because she is emotionally unstable sometimes but not clinically depressed and only short periods of time. I am afraid that confiding in people will only make my living situation worse without actually helping my state of mind. I dont know what responses this may get but thanks anyways. I know this sounds like a douche thing to say and I appreciate the good intentions but please spare me the hang in there",
    "My breakup is killing me That was a week ago, the same day she broke up with me in fact, its kind of the reason why we got into the fight responsible for our breakup. After that, I trained every day, thinking itd help me lose weight. But in fact, while I lost 1.5kg within a week, almost half of that was apparently muscle mass. I found out about that yesterday. Now I dont even want to train anymore. In the last few weeks, I found myself repeatedly contemplating passive suicide, as in, it wouldnt be so bad if I drove recklessly and that killed me some day, wouldnt it? Now, I feel like I actually want to die. She had issues, and sometimes those issues really annoyed the hell out of me. But who doesnt have those? I feel stupid for losing her and I feel like I wont ever be able to forgive myself. I was ready to marry this girl, but I lost her, due to my own stupidity. I wont ever find another woman like her again, I know that for certain, and I hate myself for it. I would do anything to get back with her, but she has made it clear that shes not interested in me anymore. Now I know that she will go on tons of tinder dates, kiss other guys, have sex with other guys, maybe in our shared bed and its killing me inside. Is it jealousy? Purely hormonal? I hope it is because if this feeling goes on, I think Im actually going to try something. Im not in therapy, I know I should be, but my depression is making it hard to actually get a therapist. Not to mention that usually youll have to wait a few months until theres a vacant spot. Please help me",

    "Wife wants space to fight depression I have made the conscious decision to fight with every strand of my being to save this marriage and I will not be the one that ends it. Things have been fairly positive, we have met up at least once a week for walkscoming over for dinner etc etc. But its all very friendly, but I do say that I love her every now and then. She wants to take things one step at a time and she is open to marriage counselling, if the mental health counselling doesnt work out. I think deep down she still loves me even though she doesnt say it or that she misses me but does slip in the odd soppy nickname here and there. Might be just a habit, I dont know. She still clearly cares about me because the other day she barged into the house after my phone wasnt receiving sending calls or texts and I didnt let her know I was safe at home. She also does other things like picks things off me like the odd scab and blackhead here and there, cut my hair and hugs me in a meaningful manner. I feel like I may be rambling a bit here, I want to feel positive about things but I am really struggling. I am putting a brave face on for her so she has less pressure, but anytime we part ways I sob uncontrollably for hours because i just love her so much and want her to come home. Has anyone else gone through something similar with their spouse? Any tips? Ive been extremely self critical and I can see there are improvements I can make to make the relationship better. Especially now we have more financial freedom. But with lockdown still in force, it makes things 10x more difficult. TLDR My wife wants space to find out what she wants. She says Ive done nothing wrong. We still talk and meet up. Marriage counselling after her individual counselling. Im hurting and want neutral advice.",

My own best friend is abused by her parents. My mom grew up in a terrible environment and is traumatized. I was bullied for a few years at kindergarten and school and I get yelled at by mom. A lot of people told me that those are not reasons to be depressed, that Im just exaggerating and Im an attention seeker. I feel like theyre right?? There are a lot of people who are going through worse stuff and theyre not able to get help. Someone else definitely needs that hour of therapy more than me. My mind is very mean to me lately. Theres this kind of voice who is telling me that Im just a lazy piece of shit who is faking their own illness for attention. This makes me feel even more shitty. I cant take it anymore. Im not diagnosed because my mom doesnt allow me to get therapy and I rarely go to the doctor only if absolutely necessary.

    "How to get brave enough to kill yourself Especially seeing how the world responded to Covid Mostly the US and watching everyone bitch and moan how they cant go out or get haircuts while THOUSDANDS of people are dying is just so fucking disgusting. Humans have outstayed their welcome amp I honestly cant wait for the end of the human race. I have no interest in anything anymore and even if I did, like drawing, I immediately remind myself how pointless it is. Ive been drawing for a good chunk of my life and seeing children so far ahead of me in development and skill just makes me realize how Ive wasted my time on something so trivial. I have no messages or any grand ideas to out into the world. No one wants to see shit from a dumb ass white girl from LA. Well, a dumb ass ugly white girl I love animals but cant take care of them for shit amp I feel like Im always failing them. Humans do nothing but slay and enslave animals and we dont care how many have to go extinct as long as we get fancy things. Im taking up way too much space and resources. I could be happy and free by now sell all my shit and travel the world before kicking the bucket but instead I choose to run the rat race, get that tiny slice of bread and do what every other human does. Im too scared to do it but getting closer I think!! so this is what I deserve. I have shit planned like trustswills and how Id do it but I dont deserve peace. I cant even say really why Im coming to the internet for advice when I know exactly how itll turn out. Get maybe a few replies, mostly being trolls and the rest being a generic itll get better! crap I feel just wrong in this person suit that was not tailor made for me and theres no way of getting out except death.

    "Should I kill myself? I am the most uninteresting person and I feel like I am the only one who puts effort into any of my relationships. I guess Ill tell you a bit about myself, since this really is a chance for me to rant. I know the question sounds edgy, or attention seeking but I just cant get this thought out of my head. Okay so I had a shitty childhood as lots of people had, mother was Schizophrenic, father was controlling and abusive. It created a lot of stress for me as, I never got a chance to build friendships as a child. I was too scared to bring people home and have them see what my family was like. Also I was usually way poorer than the others in my area, so I would constantly be judged for what I had or how Id dress. Though thats not whats causing me stress now, Ive somewhat moved past that phase. My family became somewhat middle class, I live with my stepmom and dad in a new city when I was 13. He isnt as bad anymore, but I hate living in this city. As soon as I came here, I got bullied and pushed around. Had to deal with being jumped and just insecurity. Shortly before moving I started to find my group, and I had friends that I had a lot of fun with, even though most of the time was spent at their place, but after moving I couldnt find anyone I vibed with. No one I can connect, everyone thought I was weird and out of place. So I just focused on myself  I want to be a computer scientist someday do just focus on that. Though there was always this sense of loneliness. I am socially anxious, awkward, and have trouble meeting new people, but honestly on the inside, I am an extrovert. I constantly crave social interaction, I want go spend most of my time with other people, like the only time I need alone time is to practice piano. But even then its more fun with others around. This loneliness just slowly made me sadder and sadder. I slowly got more and more awkward and struggled more and more to reach out.",

Im too lazy to get grades better than Cs, and my social life is worse than an 80 year old retiree with a dead spouse and estranged children. I feel as if my default state is depressed, with small bouts of happiness, then back into the trenches for me. I keep thinking Ive found happiness in the love of someone else, only for it to be stomped out and kicked until I taste the blood.

I know they say having an SO just causes more strife and pain, but I just want to see what a proper relationship is like and experience the life everyone else talks about.

    "Need help figuring out alternative reasons why I'm experiencing excessive sleep, extreme tiredness, low energy, no motivation but stable mood Id like to get a better idea before I go to the Dr. I brought up the possibility of doing a sleep study, but she said they probably wont be able to do much about excessive sleep, its mostly for people having trouble getting or staying asleep. But she said ifwhen my primary Dr rules out any nondepression related reason Im so tired constantly, she could refer me to a sleep specialist. Im sorry for the godawful formatting and thank you again!",
    "Scared of starting antidepressants Im a 22 year old guy Currently in college studying economics, in my 5th year. I struggle with depression, GAD and minor OCD. I have major issues with motivation. Most of the time, especially when Im stressed out the most, I lack any motivation whatsoever. There are a couple fields that interest me, but the college experience has been very stressful for me altogether. However, Im not motivated to do anything. Starting a new degree doesnt motivate me because Im not passionate about anything in particular, except for statistics, and my degree is the best to undertake a specialization in that which I want to do. Very often, if not almost everyday, its hard to get up from bed. Its hard to eat. Its hard not to cry. I have the full support from my parents, I have friends, I dont struggle financially yet Im profoundly unhappy. I hate myself as well. I have suicidal ideation very often. Im scripted benzos but I want to drop them for antidepressants. Benzos make my anxiety better and make me motivated and cheerful but theyre not something designed for long term use. So I want to ask my doctor for an antidepressant script, since he is a very kind and understanding guy and Im sure hed script me what he thinks is best however Im profoundly scared of side effects. I have more exams in one month and Im scared to be hit by side effects during them and that they might make it even worse. Idk if its irrational. But thats my thought process. Thanks to anyone reading this.",
    "I’ve had a rlly good last few days even today is fine so why do I feel so depressed? Sure there are definitely some things Id change if I could. But Im pretty sure I cant sooo why let it brother me? I push myself through the days but Im just not happy. Im depressed and havent felt this for awhile. I miss how I use to feel. I just let something get a hold of me and now its hard to shake it off. Im not sure if its correlated with the pinching chest pain Ive been having as well. I see its affecting a few of my highly valued relationship and my health. Anyone have any tried and true healthy tricks to distract themselves from this feeling? Its weird to want to start caring again and yet dont at the present time I just wish I could go to some island by myself with a few mojitos and a hammock.. just relax in the sun. Hear the ocean the breeze. And not give a damn about anything or anyone except my dogs  of course. Maybe thats what I need. Just sit alone no worries no expectations from anyone no confusion or stress about this or that. No work. Just healing. Just some me time.

    "What can i do to comfort my girlfriend I am in a relationship with the love of my life. Shes amazing, loving and overall the best. She suffers from depression for a few years. I have no real experience with depression but i know i cant heal it for her and that she has no control over it. However i dont love her less for that. I just want to be there for her and comfort her the best i can. Sadly therapy is not available for her at the moment. So im trying to gather as much information as i can to be there for her.

    "Should I kill myself? I am the most uninteresting person and I feel like I am the only one who puts effort into any of my relationships. I loved gsming with her, or playing piano for her. Not feeling uptight in this relationship like the last. But yet it still feels like its coming to an end soon and I cant believe this is happening again. I really want it to work but idk what to do. I tried reaching out to friends more and making new friends but its more of me putting sll the effort. No one is responsive. Like I dont need to talk about my girlfriend or the relationship, I just want to distract myself and have people there so I feel cared for. I am stuck in this spot I was in, in 2020 again. I am about to be alone again. I of course have not told my girlfriend about these thoughts, not her problem. But like I feel like my life is going to be this cycle of me craving attention and chasing others away. I cant live in this constant cycle. Love isnt worth it, if it always ends in a break up. I have no close friends so I am going to be alone. Like am I just bound to suffer. I dont even think I enjoy cs anymore, but it feels too late to go into music or business. Plus I dont have the contacts for business. My career feels hopeless, my relationships feel hopeless, and being more confident one day feels like a longshot. So here I am thinking to myself, do I end it? Is it worth the continual suffering? Is this relationship hopeless? Will I find friends that I can connect with? Will I become a better person? Will I succeed? I dont know, and at this point, it feels like I should give up.",
    "Being alone makes me depressed Im 24 and failing in college which makes me depressed since Im afraid Ill keep being a loser, I have small amount of friends and we rarely talk or hangout, Im single and that also makes me sad and my family rarely talk to me. People always make fun of me by calling me stupid, ugly and virgin, at first I didnt care about it, but since the pandemic I almost never meet anyone, rarely chat or talk to anyone too and it makes me really lonely. Seeing my big brother friends, coworkers and gf come to our house having a good time makes me envious of him, Im already depressed and seeing him having things I dont make me even more depressed and feel like a complete loser, he sometimes jokingly make fun of me for not having a gf and said I will stay a virgin my entire life. I know he was joking and I ruminate what he said and cry. I started not giving a shit about college and left all the classes and exams for 2 semesters, being suicidal and tried several method and failed. Now I feel a bit better after going to therapist and try to fix my college life so I can be something, but every time I remember what he said for being a virgin etc still get in my nerves and makes me slightly depressed, and seeing couples in the street, or seeing my big brother and her gf being romantic makes me really depressed, listening to love music makes me want to cut my ears and shoves tnt on my eardrum. I want to focus on my college but every time I get reminded that Im still single makes me lose motivation on doing anything except hanging myself but I failed before so maybe another method. I bought a gun 2 days ago and thinking of shooting myself on the head but when I tried to point the gun to myself I feel terrified. I dont know what to do and I also hate my self for leaving college for 2 semesters I could have passed this year if I didnt do this stupid shit",

I cant be happy for them, and it only makes me think worse about myself. They are looking for a new place but it might take months. Same for me if I want to move out. I am scared of loneliness. I need some sex but it dose not work for me with prostitutes. I tried Tinder and other stuff, no real results and I am loosing hope with every day passing.

I feel alone in the dedication and commitment I have to wanting to make a relationship work.

I cant figure out when my brain has made something up it never feels made up! It always feels real. I feel, like whats the point of a relationship if it might just end one day. I cant imagine being alone. I dont want to be alone. I know its unhealthy. I understand this. I understand that I have a problem. But, its not going to just simply go away. Its not that I am not capable of making it go away. Im sure I could try. Its that I do not want to let go of my dreams. I dont want to live another way, but I feel alone.

    "Suicidal and going to be a father So its a long story but basically Ive realised Today Im actually suicidal. Basic short of the story is. I was with my gf for 4 months was the most intense and passionate relationship Ive ever been in and Ive loved her more than Ive ever loved anyone. She announces shes pregnant and changes due to hormones ect and I struggle to cope due to the stress of finding out Im going to be a father so I drink and we argue constantly. Then she suddenly leaves me and i become a full on alcoholic drinking everyday in complete despair 6 weeks go past and Im too afraid to message her but I do think about this child and I cant just Abandon it so I Eventually decide message her to tell her I want to be a father to this child. She says she will let me be involved cause she wants the child to have a father. But tells me she never wants to get back together and just wants to be friends and civil for the child. Saw her for the first time in 6 weeks yesterday and I thought it would make me feel better but it doesnt just makes me feel worse cause the pain is so intense. Tells me she never wants to get back together with me and at this point I was looking at the floor my lips trembling and Im on the verge of tears and Im pretty sure she knew this and she said we could be friends but in a way that she was trying to comfort me and basically say atleast Im in your life in some way. She showed me the scan photo and today she went for another scan and sent me the video of the babys heartbeat and tbh I know I should be happy but Im not Im so depressed I just wanted cry cause I cant bear not being with her. Now I asked her for a pic of the baby scan and she said later shes out. I strongly suspect shes having sex with someone and I just cant cope.she left 6 weeks ago and Ive not been happy since Im constantly having to contain my tears and my anger and I just dont see the point anymore. Im even jealous of how much she talks about the child like thats all she cares about and I never mattered. I do want to be a good father to my child when its born but at the moment its hard to see past this pain. Any advice ?",

    "Placing too much on outside help? Hello, I 20m am a Junior in college. I have dealt with social anxiety, self esteem issues, and most recently depression for nearly half my life. It was a result of reactionary behavior I caused my own problems and I have never been able to shake it, as I tell myself I am incapable of change. Cause yourself problems once, you will sure as hell cause them again I have been spiraling more or less over the last few years, and only now am I sane enough to look at my lifelong issues. Unfortunately, I recently moved to a new city where I know no one. The loneliness has recently gotten to my head, and that combined with the stressfulness of college has me incredibly overwhelmed. Suicide has been on my mind more and more lately until I told myself today I would do it. But here I am. I have an appointment with a therapy clinic lined up on 59 May 9th  USA, but I do feel guilty to an extent. All that goes through my head upon dealing with my problems is tell the therapist and they will assist you in making sense of it. This has me feel irresponsible and ridiculous. There has been many people in life who cant afford help and have gotten along just fine. Its your life, and at the end of the day its on you to fix it. Yet at the same time I am so lost. All that goes through my head is my inner critic, saying its pointless. Sorry to ramble. My point being, those who have had success beating their issues on their own, what techniquesroutinesactivities did you use  partake in? What helped change your perspectives? Any feedback is appreciated thanks for reading if for some reason you got this far",
    "giving up Ive been depressed since 2013 and I feel like Im ungrateful because of it. I feel like Im hurting my mom. Im almost 20 and I lost all my youth on it. My dad left when I was 5 and I started to get really sad but depression just came out when I became a teenager. Im doing therapy and it makes me feel better sometimes, Im taking pills too, but I still hate myself, I hate everything I do, everything I am and it kills me to think Im hurting my mom and my grandmas. Every month my psychiatrist tells me Ill have to take more antidepressants because Im not getting better. A few weeks ago she told me I have a bordeline historic besides depression and anxiety, and I hate that my mom is paying for all my pills and my treatment while Im planning to kill myself. I know she wouldnt be happy if I was dead, but Im struggling, Im too tired now, after almost seven years. I tried to kill myself once last month with sleeping pills, but my family took me to emergency. I saw my mother crying and I couldnt do much more than hating myself violently.

    "Two Depressed people in a relationship Im really struggling and need some support right now. Ive been with my boyfriend for a few months, and we clicked immediately. Weve always been really forthcoming with our struggles with mental illness. I tend to lean more into anxiety with sporadic bouts of depression. He, on the other hand, is a full blown clinically depressed. The depression started creeping up beginning of September. At first it was subtle, and I was doing ok with dealing and understanding. But now, its manifested into full blown anxiety attacks on my end. I cant even joke around and be fun anymore, because I consider every thing he says to be to be a slight against me. Im misfiring and crying uncontrollably. And Im constantly battling between my intellect and what I know hes depressed, its not a choice, he doesnt mean to pull away or hurt my feelings when hes withdrawn, etc. and my anxiety monologue something is wrong, because I am wrong, and hes not telling me because he wants me to break up with himhurt me. The major difference between us is, I have a support system. I have group therapy, one on one therapy, and tools that I use to keep me in check. But lately, I can feel my codependency on him being happy completely fuck with my own well being. He says this is just how he is, and has been luke warm to my suggestions to see a therapist though I know he believes in counseling and has gone in the past. And its also screwed with our intimate side which I think is a lot of the source of ire. Sex is important, but my partners well being is of course more important. I am usually the one initiating, but the last few weeks hes been so down, we cant connect on that level. I have my own issues with self worth and feeling desired. A previous ex of mine withheld sex as a means to get us to break up, so I am on high alert. Its really hard to hear he loves me and this has nothing to do with me, but to feel the actions he makes are contradictory. I am really struggling to allow him this space to process and move through his depression without imploding on my end.",
    "Depression Treatment Options MDD for the past 2 years. Bipolar, depression, and anxiety all run in my family very prevelently, but none have received any kind of treatment except lithium for a bipolar grandparent. Im currently considered treatment resistant. Onto my 5th antidepressant now. Done SSRIs, SNRIs, Wellbutrin, and Buspar dont know why my doc thought that one was a good idea, I dont have anxious symptoms. Im beginning to think oral medications are not the route for me unless perhaps a tetracyclic or MAOI works out. Id be interested in trying lithium because I know it has helped a family member and I have also been mis?diagnosed as bipolar, so maybe it could work? Im going to bring that up to my new psychiatrist tomorrow. TMS and ECT sound like great options except the price tag. My insurance would only cover half, so Id still be paying upwards of 10k for treatment. Not something I can afford. So I need to look for something else that I could possibly try thats cheaper. And yes, Ive done psychotherapy and group therapy, and it doesnt help in the slightest. Ive looked into alternate medicine like acupuncture, although i doubt its efficacy my theory is that it works solely due to the placebo effect. and that hasnt even worked for things i thought would work for me. Perhaps clinical trials could be an option, but thats not necessarily treatment for me. Ive been suggested to try an outpatient program or check into a psych ward but Ive heard bad things about them. Plus, Im not sure how my treatment would be any better than just going to a psychiatrist on my own. Please let me know your experiences or suggestions! I am willing to try anything to get better, and Ive been researching my options, but have heard very little experience past the basic medication side of things.",
    "Friend committed suicide during quarantine and I feel myself backsliding I dont really have a whole lot to say. Ive struggled with depression most of my life.

In any case, a friend of mine who was living in my old room committed suicide and Ive been struggling ever since.

I have been having like violent visions and thats not really something thats ever happened to me before. Thats the part that I dont feel like I can share with anyone. When I look at my anger from a more logical perspective, I know its not justified, and yet thats often not enough to make it go away. I feel like Im fighting for my life because of this.

I cant say If its my thoughts or somebody else is speaking. They are so loud and clear. Am I dying or something? Ive been crying for about 4 hours. The time went so fast. I am not sure if Im alive or not. Nobody hears anyway. Maybe Im a ghost or something. Maybe thats the reason why nobody is answering. I guess I wrote many letters and called many people. Why dont they answer? Am I ugly or something? Maybe Im invisible. Then why she screams at me. She probably should know that she screams at emptiness. Maybe Im so shy so people cant notice me. Thats possible. Maybe I dont exist. Hmm. No, Ive seen my name on documents. Well, okay. Maybe Im half dead. Do I need to make myself completely dead? Huh. Is somebody reading this? In case If somebody is reading. English is my third language, so I believe there are thousands of mistakes. I wrote this because I wanted to speak with somebody without feeling guilty. So. I wrote this in English because theres a little hope in me. But I guess its worthless.",
    "Feels like I have to get high just to feel anything anymore. I feel so lost and alone. I got broke up with by someone I love so so deeply and felt so happy and safe with and ever since then Ive just descended into a deep depression and I dont know what to do. Im stuck at home, mostly in my bed cause I got injured. I cant feel happy anymore it seems. My antidepressants stopped doing anything and its just crippling sadness and pain and Ive started contemplating suicide and self harming again. Im not sure what to do anymore. I started smoking and it helped some, but not as much as I need it to. Ive tried so much and it just doesnt help. I just dont know what to do anymore.",
    "A bit of a strange case: Exercise has DESTROYED my mental health. Thoughts? Advice? more than I hated swimming. Every second of my 95 minute sessions felt like torture. The intensity didnt matter, as even super lowintensity sessions made me doubt my sanity. But, because Id been so used to doing a huge amount of cardio every day, I literally made myself go to the gym to row. This sent me into a deep depression. I dreaded waking up every day, as I knew that I would have to go do a torturous rowing session at some point during the day. After watching a video on existentialism and Nietzsche, I decided to completely change my life and viewpoint. I realized that what Id been doing for the past year and a half or so was INSANE. What was the point of doing so much cardio? I was already fairly skinny, and I had no plans of becoming an athlete. I realized that I needed to live life to the fullest and actually enjoy myself, rather than wake up every day to torture myself. So I completely stopped doing rowing, and reoriented my fitness focus to strength training, the activity which I had enjoyed for so long. But unfortunately, this didnt work out. The toxic attitude I had regarding rowing poisoned my once beloved activitystrength traininglifting. I hyperfocused on the negative aspects of lifting the pain, the struggle, the discomfort. I no longer enjoyed lifting, instead, I dreadedhated it. It felt like torture as well. This only worsened my depression, as I realized that NO form of exercise would help, or even just have a neutral effect on my mental health. I took a twoweek break from all exercise a couple of weeks ago, and yes, I managed to distract myself with other activities, but when I returned to lifting, my depression returned. Imagine knowing that, for four out of seven days a week, you will be stabbed, shocked, beaten, and tortured. That is how I feel and how I have felt for what seems like so long. I feel like Im a prisoner in Guantanamo Bay, and frankly, Im surprised that more people havent killed themselves in that godforsaken place.",
    "I don't know what to do at this point other than end it. Nothing has helped so far. My mom was some sort of sick twisted bitch or whatever. She ended up in jail pretty often, too. The physical fights stopped after I was born, my dad stopped drinking, and my both parents became law abiding citizens. Occasionally they would throw things at each other, and they still get in screaming matches, but its nothing like it was before I existed. I was born a really gifted kid 157 IQ I know it doesnt matter, really good at everything, scary type of smart, extremely mature for my age. The only thing I wasnt good at and still am not good at, lol was prolonged physical activity. My mom has emotionally abused for my entire life using this fact. She has essentially turned me into a perfectionist and led me to believe that it was my fault, and not hers. She has never accepted anything less than straight As and perfection, but instead of punishing me like a normal kid grounding or no allowance or more chores, she would scream at me until she was blue in the face and occasionally beat or shove or throw me, yelling about how I was a disappointment and a failure to her. She emotionally neglected me as well she never paid attention to me or gave me praise unless I was doing something that she wanted me to do. She knows nothing about me, and loves the image of me she has made. She says I am a waste of money, and makes me feel guilty for needing basic things like food and health care. We are pretty poor, but I think that is overstepping the line. She vicariously lives her life through me because she ruined her life at my age she stayed with my dad and dropped out of college to have me at 22. This is only a summary of the things she does. It would be much worse if I went into detail. Nothing I do makes me feel good enough. I am severely fucked up because of my mom. I have no idea how to maintain healthy relationships, whether it be with friends or romantic partners. I have no self esteem, no self respect, and if Im honest? I have no personality or sense of self, either.",
    "Complete recovery after depression is a realistic expectation? Hey, before depression took over my life I23F used to be such a happy person  joyful, positive, hyped about all kinds of activities, passionate about life. Before finishing college I used to think that lack of time is my only problem, I had so many plans and wishes and I used to think that depression isnt a real thing, that some people just choose to be unhappy. And then it hit me  repressed childhood trauma, unhealthy relationships with my family members and too many disappointments in my love life gave me depression. At first I thought its only a bad phase and I was expecting it to end soon since I was about to start my summer vacations. I had planned a 2 weeks trip to Scotland and I was really hyped about it for like 6 months before leaving, but somehow I couldnt enjoy it, I only wanted to sleep and be alone and I was struggling to get through each day without being rude or visibly irritated by everything was going on around me. Thats when I realized that bad phase was a special one, but I only decided to get specialized help when I was already 4 months deep into it. At that point I was a mess, crying several times every day, spending all my free time sleeping, being terrified of my own thoughts, started thinking about suicide, pursuing a toxic online relationship, being unable to watch movies or reading books due to losing my ability to concentrate. At that moment, one of my best friends told me I was only a shadow of the person I used to be. The best feeling I was able to get about anything was this is almost acceptable. After my first visit to the psychiatrist I was put on medication and after only one month things became a little bit brighter for me  Christmas was coming and I started WANTING TO DO STUFF AWAKE!! I started watching netflix again, playing video games, hanging out with friends. I was still sad mostly, but I was able to enjoy these things from time to time which was nice. I also got fired right before Christmas for sleeping too much at work and doing almost nothing because of my depression, but I wasnt even mad about it.",

After 5 practice sketches i decided to call it out for the day, now im in the bed eating junk food out of depression. These things happened before, but this happened in such a unusual way, it normally happens after my ASSHOLE dad pisses me off. But this time it was the memory alone that triggered my anger, i dont know if the secondary effects are meant to happen in just the next day of starting the treatment. I know this isnt the place to ask about medicine but in case this is more in the psychological side then i need a new perspective on the matter.",

    "Questions about taking Wellbutrin XL 150 mg, about 72 hours before I start Still, a destructive and potentially lifethreatening pattern comes up in my life, time and time again, and my psychiatrist, my mother, and others believe that Wellbutrin XL 150 mg may help. The pattern is as follows I feel resentful about people that have intentionally or unintentionally harmed me in the past, I feel anxiety and shame about my finances, inconsistent income that pays well when I do get paid and the cost of living in downtown Toronto, I feel anxiety, guilt, and shame about my partial dependency on my parents and a myriad of other things, I feel anxiety concerning many nuances of operating two businesses while starting a third, I feel anxiety, shame, and guilt concerning my lack of a dating life and sexual anorexiathe unconscious avoidance of dating, so I doubledown on activities related to my businesses, I doubledown on the seemingly beneficial and health activities that I previously mentioned, I work incredibly hard, going past my physical and psychological limits, I soothe myself by doing highvolumes of seemingly good things, I burnout, and then I become depressed, I experience suicidal ideation, and then I engage in selfsoothing by raging, ruminating about my resentments, having sex with socalled high end escorts aka prostitutes, and binge eating processed food. This pattern happens about once or twice per month it takes at least a couple of days to recover from, it is pretty destructive, and nothing that I have done since 2014 has put a permanent stop to it. I meditate every day, and I engage in the activities mentioned above every day, yet I often find myself in the same place. With that said, I have a few specific questions about taking Wellbutrin XL 150 mg, and I am hopeful that someone through Reddit will answer them for me, as the pharmacist that dispensed the Wellbutrin XL 150 mg could not answer some of my questions. 1.

I have dropped out twice from uni and have only a part time job now. I finished high school with the schools best diploma and I know I have all this potential that Im just wasting. Just writing this out makes me feel so awful and spikes my anxiety really bad. I dont know what to do, I feel like its embarassing that Im not in a university and all those other people are Ik this is horribly selfish.

    "It's not getting better.. Please listen and dont downvote me. Ive been facing severe depression and anxiety for about 8 years now. Needless to say, its been dreadful. I finally sought professional help in the form of psychiatrist. Turns out his meds made things worse. Then after some years, I thankfully found a good psych who did make a difference. The difference is this I became more functioning. Thats it. The inner turmoil is still very much there. Ive been to multiple therapists Mind you, were talking about the most well renowned and expensive therapists in my region but it just made no positive change at all. We went at lengths to discuss and dissect me and my life and my behaviors and my emotions. All this analysis increased my overthinking to the point that now my mind constantly thinks and is aware of each and everything. Like hey you did this because of xyz feeling. Its painfully exhausting. Its like a constant 247 commentary in my mind, which was fueled by the therapy. After each therapy session, I felt ashamed, guilty, and worthless. So much negativity about me. Reinforcing the idea that there is something gravely wrong with me. Never did I feel validated at therapy. Never was I told what I can do to feel better. It was like talking to a mirror. Just reflecting back what I said. Which quite frankly, I dont need to hear as my mind has been chattering all those things for years now. I am very lost, confused, hurt and hopeless now. I cannot find any solution. What can I do..",
    "I’m done. Im done. I dont know why today is the day that broke the camels back, but I feel like bursting into tears. By all standards my life should be great. Loving parents, amazing spouse, Good inlaws, good paying job, nice new home, stable friends, and no major health problems. But I just sit here and writhe in emotional pain, I feel like driving my truck into a concrete barrier. Im an adult. What could I possibly be sad about? I tell people around me I dont feel right, like how Im abnormally stressed, anxious, or sad. Everyone dismisses me. Not a rude way but, in a manner like hey man we all feel that way sometimes. My loved ones around me feels so needy, like if I were to hand off an ounce of my pain it would shatter them. I sit here and smile, do my best to join in on the conversation and not draw undue attention to myself. My day to day job is being a Doctor, I get to help people and it makes me feel like I have purpose. But its not enough. I try to save money, not spend too much on myself, donate to others. But its not enough. I try to enjoy little hobbies, get outside, play with my dog, spend time with my friends. But its not enough. I still feel sad. I reach out on forums for depression and ask do I have a problem? Is it normal to feel this way? And not even the masses have comments for me. I dont want to commit suicide because I would feel too responsible for the pain and mess I left behind. But if I was told tomorrow is my last day, I dont think I would fight it much.

Be on my own. Rely only one myself. But I need people.

Like, nobody ever contacts you or reaches out to ask how youre doing. you spend so much time pouring into relationships, doing your best to make sure people like you and then in the end...they just forget you. You only hear from them when YOU initiate contact. I guess im just wondering if anyone else has a fear of being forgotten. I spent so much time nurturing and cultivating these relationships but ultimately...you cant keep it alive on your own. It has to be a mutual effort. And thats what kills me....being the only one that cares. Its always been this way. Being the only one that misses people. People who probably have never even had a passing thought about you. I guess im just having a hard time accepting the fact that I dont mean anything to anyone. How do you guys cope with the silence?

My whole life i was overweight and didnt really have that many friends and most of them only wanted to take advantage of me because of money or something else and that lead to many trust issues low selfesteem and loneliness.. growing up i never had anyone to talk to because my brothers did not really care back then and my parents were very busy working.. they tried to replace love and care with money and gifts so i spent a lot of time by myself in our home not going outside but it didnt bother me back then because it felt normal that way and soon i started to have an interest to the internet and computers in general video games youtube hardware etc etc and thats where the whole started going downhill.. i didnt have space for a computer back then because i shared my room with my brothers so i started going to internet cafes near me and i would spend all of my money to buy more playtime and prepaid cards for games.. every day i was getting more and more addicted to the internet and that lead to less time outside, less physical activity, more and more weight gain and i started skipping school.

I mean, I cried because crying was like my main occupation along with sleeping and because I knew thats what Im supposed to do when I get fired but I didnt really feel much about that event. In January I went in a trip to New York with one of my best friends and I enjoyed every moment of it! Then I came home and started looking for a new job. I was so relaxed and carefree and I was becoming my old self again. In February I started a new job and shortly after that I stopped my antidepressants treatment. But I feel like this journey of becoming my old self again is never going to be complete. Sometimes I get close to what I used to be before this whole thing but I cant sustain that, like the oldhappyme is visiting sometimes but she doesnt wanna stay. Even though things go great for me now great new job, great old friends, new healthy romantic relationship I am mostly anxious and scared. I cant be genuinely happy with the good things I have in my life, because the fear of losing them and going straight back into depression is overwhelming. I heard things like youll never go back to what you used to be before depression, depression leaves a scar youll have to live with your entire life, depression is a part of growing up, you just cant go back. I am starting to believe these things and its sad. Are they true? I have no chance to going back to my old self?",
    "Had my 1st doctor appointment to address my anxiety/depression, it was......weird. Need some feedback, please. So I had my first Drs appointment to address my increasing anxiety and depression yesterday, and found some things a bit...odd. Id like some feedback on a few things just need to know whether some of the stuff Im about to post is common, or not ampx200B 1. A lot of the stuff was up to me and I was given questions I had no idea how to prepare for or answer. I went into this with a I have no idea what the hell is going on in my head, but its bad, and I need to address it mentality. I have no idea why Im depressed or anxious so much, only that I did NOT used to be like this. Do you think your Anxiety is caused by your Depression, or your Depression is caused by your Anxiety? The answer? I honestly have no idea, Im coming in with my own mind being a total mystery to me. I didnt know it had to be either one of these. I was asked what kind of medication I think I should be on given a choice between Wellbutrin or another unnamed medication that attacks both Anxiety and Depression together  I had no idea how to answer this either, I dont know. When I made this decision I was only 30 minutes into discussing this with a medical professional for the first time in my life, I have absolutely no clue. ampx200B 2. After this short 45minute single appointment with a Psychiatrist, I walked out with prescriptions for Wellbutrin XL and Vistaril. I havent taken either yet, because Im not sure thats right for me. I just feel like 45minutes wasnt even close to enough time for me to explain me and give enough information that a Doctor could make a decision on the right medication for me. And I know that antidepressants and medications of this sort are a total crapshoot, but even given that, I dont feel confident that Id even be taking a good crapshoot from a single 45minute appointment with a brand new doctor. Is that notion true? Are antidepressants and medications like this still a total crapshoot?",
    "How not to think life is unfair to you? I have depression for years and I am the highly functioning kind. I do a lot, I study, I work, I try to take courses who will make me better at my job and everything demands a crazy amount of effort from me because of... you guessed! Depression! Then I see people around me that do not do shit and things seem to fall on their lap. They get bonus at work, the shares they bought made a crazy amount of money, family comes visit with amazing gifts for them, they get promotions at work while telling me they are putting the minimum effort on what they do... life in general seems to be so easy for them. I know I shouldnt compare. I know I should focus on the percentage I am better today when compared to me yesterday. But it is freaking hard. I feel like a huge failure in everything I touch or try to do. From money, work, health, family and friends relationships, I do not succeed in any of these areas. How to stop with thinking it is unfair? How not to care about the others?",
    "I'm losing hope Hello. Idk if anyone is even going to read this. But its my last resort....an...idk what else to do after this...so...here goes nothing. Im 18. All my life Ive been alone. Ive been bullied, beaten, mocked, and hated. Im tired of living everyday and knowing Im going to feel worse than yesterday. Everyday is just more pain. Idek what to write because theres so much to say. Im alone...and depressed. I probably sound like everyone else...but at this point Im desperate. Making friends is hard... Im sorry...all my thoughts are racing so its hard to know what to write. Everyone is finding love...and here I am...alone...and depressed. My friends always say looks dont matter YES THEY DO!!! ....they do... Im alone... Im not just depressed because of that... I am nothing. Nothing I do matters... I am nothing... Im a nobody.

Everyone!! I just.... I just need help... Im losing grip on my life...",
    "People who have been deeply depressed before, does it ever truly get better? I havent felt like myself in the longest time. When I think of my future I cant even see past the next year, it seems like theres no hope for me at all. I feel like my friends hate me, my family doesnt care about me, that no one would actually care if I was gone. I know that may not be completely true, but I cant help myself from feeling that way. Its a lonely feeling, and I cant seem to shake myself from it no matter how I try. I feel like Im merely existing rather than living, and I have no idea how to change it or what fo do to make it better. The only thing that keeps me from ending it is my parents. I could never put them through that. Anyone ever pulled themselves from the trenches of depression and made it out successfully? I could use some positivity right about now.",
    "I have something that I don't know the name of I dont know why Ive said this PS The imaginations has happen equal to animals, dog. I dont know why but i like me doing cool things, i imaginated me likle satan, lucifer, king of hell, prince. Maybe because i watched lucifer or like devil may cry. Watched dmc5 recently. Every day i think on suicide. I dont know if this is sad. Once on tv i saw a childhood abuse case and i didnt feel empathy I guessgt Some time I feel empathy principal when i was reading comic books. Even when people are bad with me I imaginated them in a dangerous situation but I feel bad and save them. It happens with my brother. Mom and Papa too. Shame of being a member of my fmaily. Once I start to thing that nobody lilkes me because answered me on facebook. Very well. Then, tell me, I have the right to live?",
    "What happens when you text a suicide Hotline? Suicidal thoughts are a thing I deal with all the time, especially when I end up feeling low because I have no motivation for anything. My therapists recommend using a Hotline or whatever when it gets really really bad, but I just dont see the point? Im not going to kill myself, its too much effort. And its just thoughts, so it feels kind of silly to text a crises line. So Im curious what actually happens when you use one?",
    "Loser needing advice So to keep this short i am a 32 year old who has spent pretty much his whole life in school. Ive tried really hard and have not accomplished much of anything in my life . Unimportant job, no love life Im really fat and ugly...not because I didnt try but because I take a lot of psych meds that fuck with my weight, dont make a lot of money, i still live with my folks pathetic. What things should I focus on to counteract all the loserness that I am composed of? More money? Lose a ton of weight? I just want to know if I should even bother sticking around... I know the closest thing to love Im going to get is being a womans safety school and then being punished for not being a good enough package. People who look like me arent anyones fantasy.",
    "Trying to encourage a friend to seek help and need advice. So my friend has depression, were in our 30s, and I do not know how to get him help. Hes afraid of doctors, medication, alcohol. He has very bad social anxiety. He doesnt have strong from his family who are all pretty dismissive about this. He basically only has me and Im not a professional by any means. When he gets depressed he starts shutting people out, I try not to push him to hard because Im afraid he could possibly spiral. Hes having a particularly bad few weeks recently and the last time things got really bad he shut everyone out for two years. Hes put his life on hold for years because hes afraid and sad all the time. He needs help, I know hell never seek it on his own, and I know its very difficult for someone over the age of 18 to actually seek help but I need a place to start and I dont know where.",
    "Help with budding relationship Hey all  I am sorry if this isnt what this forum is for. I have depression, but Im doing OK with it for the moment. My issue at the moment is that a guy I was dating also has depression, and after weeks of basically an excellent budding relationship, he ended it saying his anxiety was too much and didnt want to go further as his mindset wasnt in the right place. Honest, but devastating. Its now been a few months, and we have kept in contact, but the communication isnt anything like it was, and although I want to ask him if he is ready to reconnect, I dont want to push him away. ampx200B BUT I also know that with depression, you push people away in an effort to protect yourself, or because you feel like an impostor You dont deserve the loveattentionetc SO. What do I do? If I was giving advice to a friend, Id say just ask him and say If you really arent interested anymore, I get it, but I want to know if there is a chance of reconnecting and seeing what potential is here etc  BUT I know that might be triggering or whatnot. ampx200B Sigh",
    "I have a problem with getting mental help. If anything cant be solved within a minute or two, they wont hardly even look in its direction. Im near graduating, so its not like Im just some middle schooler looking for attention.

    "Should I click yes to give the psychiatrist permission to share my information with one of my parents? What are they gonna share? So I finally opened to my parents that Ive been struggling with depression, but didnt tell them the exact main reason why because of how much embarrassment and shame I feel over it. Theyve been supportive and let me set up an appointment with a psychiatrist. Theres a part that asks if they have permission to share my information with them. I really dont want them knowing about the real reason why Im depressed. I feel like Im obligated to click yes because I am on their insurance. What should I do?",
    "It's so painful My best friend stopped talking to me 2 days back. Its been so lonely. I am having lucid dreams of him coming back. I am talking to an imaginary version of him in my head. Coz no one else understood me but him. Today my parents decided to stop talking or spending time with me. We have a duplex. I am supposed to stay in the upper flat. They do give me food water and everything. But its so painful. I am dying inside. My whole body is aching and I am feeling sick. I cant sleep well. I wish everything would just stop.",
    "I'm tired and feel so drained. I know things will get better, but this part really sucks. I recently ended a toxic friendship and it hurts. Im a 44 year old single mom to a very sweet and loving 10 year old boy. Ive suffered from depression since my teens so I know the deal and all the little self care things I can do to help. Im just low on spoons right now. Im on medication but have missed 2 doses due to napping and being off schedule. Ill get back on track today though. This is most likely why Im in a slump today and things feels worse right now. I was in a bad depressive episode for about 45 months in 2020, like many others Im sure. I felt it was finally lifting, but it seems I was wrong. The stress of home learning, being stuck at home, having no social circle or bubble at all has really hit me hard. I dont have many friends, to be honest just one very good friend for the last 20 years or so, but due to COVID19 I havent seen her in about a year. We talk on the phone but its not the same. For the last 10 years I considered another single mom my friend, even though we rarely saw each other and were not close. The friendship was toxic for me and we had many talks about what wasnt working, what was and what I needed from the friendship, with no improvements and I was always sad with this friendship. I ended it last night after talking about things again for the last week or so. I know its the right thing to do for myself, but its so hard. I guess what Im hoping for from this post is support and any advice on how to get over a friendship. With the two spoons I have left today Im going to shower and put on clean pjs and get my son ready for his appointment.",
    "Today I was one step away from killing myself. Today I was one step away from killing myself. Long story short  I had a girlfriend. Weve been best friends for 7 years. The first 2 years I treated her only as a friend, but after 2 years I realized that I fell in love with her. Almost immediately I told her about it and was sent to the friend zone. But every year I fell in love with her more and more. I have never loved anyone so much, and I have never had such a friend. This year she found herself a new boyfriend. And in the end, she said that she no longer has time to communicate with me, and it would be better if we stop communicating. She threw me away like trash. I was left without friends, in a deep depression, absolutely psychologically broken. Every night I fall asleep with the thought that I want to die in my sleep, and every morning I regret that I am still alive. The only thing that keeps me from killing myself is my family. I know that if I commit suicide, my parents will not survive it. But today she posted a photo on Instagram, where her boyfriend picks strawberries, with the caption Happiness is when your man collects strawberries for you while you chill on the bench. And at that moment I was more than ever close to ending my life. For a minute, I stopped thinking about my parents, about anything else, and just wanted to go and cut my throat, or veins. Every day I want to live less and less, because I no longer have a future, there are no hopes and dreams, and I am drowning in darkness and depression. I dont think I can endure this until the end of the year and not end up with my miserable aimless existence. And so that everything is not so depressing  I am absolutely seriously going to get myself 2 tattoos this year a small trash can somewhere on my leg, and the inscription Loser on my arm. Because if I have understood anything over the past 11 years, during which I have visited 8 friend zones, it is that I am a loser, but this year I realized that I am trash",

    "Is helping / giving money to a depressed friend, no matter the amount, helpful at all? My friend says shes stuck paying off loans for college tuition as well as rentgroceries and such. Im not entirely sure what to do or say when she brings it up, which sucks for her. I know she is close with her mom and such and she hasnt said how it really affected her but Im tempted to give her some gift card for her closest food joint or would cash be okay, but I fear it would be seen as pity? I care about my friend very much and I dont know how often she tells or asks people for things but she hasnt asked me for help, just told me of her struggles. Would it be ok to offer such a thing?

    "Lost in a rabbit hole @_@ Hi, Im 23 years old and I tend to feel like Im wasting time. I stopped going to college at the end of 2017, I didnt go back for the fall semester. I found two pretty good jobs until they both laid me off, due to the fact that they were only seasonal. After that I havent felt like filling out applications, instead Ive been pursuing my dream job. I want to be a journalist and lately Ive been so far down the rabbit hole of story writing I feel like I nearly lost touch with reality. I know in order to learn you have to fail over and over and thats how I feel. At the same time I feel like Ive been spending way too much time writing and researching I forgot when the last time I talked to another human being. Im not that close to my family and I only have a couple friends, who seem to be busy most of the time. When Im not obsessing with writing I catch myself day dreaming about a perfect world where I go out on the weekends and have fun. I have never really experienced that and the thought makes me feel alone or that this humanity. People are just words on a screen now. If anyone has any tips please let me know!",

I said it could take years to heal some never do beside I cant afford to see therapists at the moment. she sent me a link with affordable therapist to contact. After going home my mom spoke to me about what she heard. She asked why I never shared this with anyone before. I said because youre my family and I rather not let you worry about me. She then asked about it and I told hear some symptoms not to scare her so much. shes a doctor so I picked my words wisely she then said that I shouldnt have shared this. I asked why? she said your brother in law heard. I said so what? are you ashamed of me now that I saw therapist once. That my mental health is not golden? That in your society Im considered crazy now? I never got an answer... Its been couple of days now and nothing happened. Nobody talked to me about it. Nobody asked about it. nobody read about it to know what the hell I experience. its nothing. Like I never shared anything like they just dont want to think about it or even acknowledge it. ampx200B Is it my fault for sharing? is it my fault for expecting at least some interest in knowing what I have? they are my family after all and I feel thats the least I should expect. Is it because what I shared arent considered as important as depression? I can never share that with them ampx200B Please share your thoughts and experiences or advices for how to handle this.

    "What is the point of getting help? I dont get it. Having a doctor lie to me to try to make me feel better isnt going to make me feel better. Taking medication isnt just gonna make my problems go away. Theyre still there, even if Im not aware of them or am tricked to think they arent there. Its like getting drunk, itll make you forget about your problems but they still very much exist.

I have finally accepted I have suffered depression most of my life. I am seeing a therapist who is helping me unpackaged my childhood reasons for shutting down.

    "is this a normal for parents to do? When i was like 1112 years old someone had done a poo in the toilet and left it and my Mum found it and both my brother and I said that we didnt do it. So my Mum made us both bend over in front of Dad and her and wiped our bums for us and then showed everyone the piece of toilet paper and whether it had shit on it or not. I remember her telling us to bend over more because she said she couldnt reach. My subconscious and conscious is telling me im a horrible person for saying this about my parents and that im just imagining it. But i know im not. Its killing me not being able to remember things from this event and from when my Mum left. The next parts foggy but i know that the first part above is definitely accurate I think my Mum wiped my bum and got shit on the paper and blamed it on me or something idk. And then i think my brother had shit on his paper as well. I think we were both ridiculed. I have many traumas involving my parents since then. Im now 18. And ive been in an emotionally incestuous relationship with my Father. My brother beats me. And my Mum doesnt do anything because she feels powerless because shes now a single mother my parents are separated I also reported my brother to the police last year for touching my boobs and beating me with a belt which my mum saw. But nothing happened and i dont think the police believed me because i was overweight. Anyway, whats everyone opinion on the poo wiping situation. Is that normal for parents to do?",

    "The Effects of Depression on a Relationship [ADVICE] I am in relationship with someone who has major depression. When it gets really bad for him, it gets bad for us. He can be a little mean, irritable. These times feel the loneliest for me. I cant help but feel sad as a consequence at times. I understand that in these moments he isnt himself nonetheless it still hurts. I am generally busy and there is distance between us. I feel guilty at times I cant do more and feel like I am being pulled everywhere in my life in general. I feel numb and sadness which I try like hell to ignore in myself to preclude any ideas of seeing a breakup as a resolution to how I am feeling. I do love him, his pain is my pain. There is a certain emotional fortification developed when you are in these types of relationships perhaps that is why I feel like I am not allowed to crumble, need or want especially when it gets really bad. Is there any better way to deal with this? with us? my loneliness? How can you be happy in life when your partner isnt? How do you share a life when your partner doesnt have the energy at times to pick the phone or talk to you?",

    "Struggling bad right now Ive 18m been struggling on and off with my depression for around 3 years now. I started smoking weed to deal with school and now college stress but that in itself has done more wrong than good as now im not only dependent but now I constantly have to lie to my mum about what Im doing which just makes me feel even more worthless and a failure of a son, not to mention the astronomical money I spend on drugs in general. I am failing college, my last chance to get a good education, meanwhile all my friends who have since moved across the country for Uni havent really kept in contact. The only people I see outside of work are the people who Im smoking weed with other than that I feel totally isolated.

I hate my music because it reminds me of hanging out with my friends who arent around anymore. There are more things but I dont want to ramble on. ampx200B No one knows this is how I truly feel, not even those closest to me. When I first started going through this I drunkenly told my friend a few tidbits but he didnt keep his word on not telling people so I decided to bottle everything up and pray that eventually my life would improve but since then its been a sharp decline.

    "What do I do for my partner experiencing an extended server depressive episode? My partner 24M and I have been together for over 6 years. We both finished classes last May. I graduated in August and we moved back to our home state. When the pandemic hit, he had to stay at home for months. Hes dealt with depression to some extent his whole life and grad school had already been pretty tough on him. He hit a major depressive episode around last April that hes been in ever since. He hasnt been able to finish his thesis or find the motivation to get a job. He sees a counselor once a week, has been trying out different medications, and even went to an outpatient program for about a week. Nothing has helped him in any substantial way. He says hes doing a little better, which makes me happy, but he still passes most days on his computer. He can only rarely leave our apartment, no longer gets to do the thing he was studying, which he loved, and constantly feels tired. Hes such a wonderful person who doesnt deserve to be in a place like this. I dont know what to do. Every day it gets harder to watch. We talked about getting a tutor to help him finish his thesis, but every call or email takes days. Progress is so slow and I dont know how much more I can take. Who can I call? What can I do? Help.",

Ive been seeing a therapist for a while now, but more recently I asked my psychiatrist starting an antidepressant. We both agreed it would give me the best chance of seeing any improvement that I have at this point. Heres the thing though, Im really nervous about taking them. Im worried Itll change me in some negative way, or significantly change my personality. So Id really like to hear from others about their experiences on medication, hopefully to get some reassurance and help me feel a bit more comfortable about starting something that could possibly help me a lot.",
    "How do I (14 M) talk to my (Typical Indian) dad about seeing a therapist? Tldr at bottom Hey guys. So, for context I am a 14 yo dude from India. I have a typical Indian dad, so that means conservative and not so openminded, and we arent close either. We havent really talked about anything else other than studies and me being a failure in the past... 3 years or so. I have been depressed and suicidal for about 2 years now and have been cutting for about a year. I think I might have anxiety, but not really sure about that. So, with that in mind, heres whats I need help with About a month ago, I tried talking to my dad about my cuts. I went to him and showed him my recent scars and he asked what they were. I told him they were cuts with a razor blade and he didnt ask me why but instead started screaming at me about me not studying and that I cut myself because of Youtube As it had rotten my brain. He told me that he would have listened to me and helped if I had gotten good grades Like, above 95 but since I havent gotten good grades I have like a 7580 overall, he doesnt give a fuck. I couldnt even tell him about what was bothering me. The first thing I said was insecurities, and he said I dont know the first thing about being insecure. Then I said anxiety and he went on and on about how I have no anxiety and its all just due to Youtube. This went on and on and I just stopped speaking. Like half an hour in, he told me that I should just take a knife and slice my wrists so I can die once and for all and how it would be great and he wouldnt give a shit This was pretty descriptive. He told me exactly where to cut and how much time it would take me to die. Also, to slice them in the bathroom sink so the bedroom doesnt get dirty After like 1.52 weeks after this convo, he came into my room and told me that he got irritated because he couldnt understand what caused me to do it and he had cried later that night. Now I dont know if I should believe him or not.",
    "i’m so sick of this shit (rant) 34yo female here. ive had major clinical depression for most of my life. im medicated. i do everything i can to keep on top of it. but it just comes back whenever it wants without any warning and knocks me out. im not suicidal BUT sometimes its so overwhelming to know that this is going to happen at random times for the rest of my life. its so exhausting. it makes me realize how tough people with depression are for fighting this off ALWAYS. but im struggling. i live alone. i have my animals thank god but i have no choice but to work. i cant take time off because i need to pay my mortgage. my friends are understanding but dont really get it. one friend just suggested i plan a fun birthday party to take my mind off of it and it honestly made me more depressed. then i felt selfish. i dont want to randomly text my friends who are busy with their kids, jobs, etc just to say i need help because it feels like a burden. no matter how many times they say its not. i just feel like they say that and then roll their eyes to themselves like oh here she goes again. i have no reason to be depressed i have a great job, home, family, friends, etc but my mind just goes insane and i suddenly cant do anything. i cant shower, barely feed myself, and just do the minimum amount of work to get by. i dont even know what im looking for. i guess just people who also feel like this. like  numb. youre not crying or angry. youre just sitting there waiting for the day to end. ive been dealing with this for 25 years and im OVER IT. i just wish i at least had a warning when it was coming back. ill be on top of the world for weeks or months and then all of a sudden, the grounds knocked out from under me and i have no control over it whatsoever. then the guilt sets in i should be cleaning my house. i should shower i should be working etc. idk im just so fed up. not suicidal.",
    "Depressed firefighter ends things My 30 f ex boyfriend 34 ended things from depression at the beginning of the shut down from covid. He told me he didnt love me anymore almost 3 weeks ago. I dont know if this is how he really feels or if its the depression closing him off to feeling anything. I havent spoken to him since he told me. But I go back and read older messages leading up to the break up and I see him telling me hes struggling with the depression but he tells me how happy I make him and how much he loves me and I keep him afloat. But once he hit a really bad rough patch he closed me out completely. Has anyone experienced this before from my position or even from his that could give me some insight of how their stories progressed with their loved ones as the depression lastedor while you or they got help? I believe in my heart he does love me and the depression suppressed those feelings. You dont just have those feelings disappear from a happy relationship without some type of issue going on. Ive been dying to reach out to him but I was the one that said I needed to heal, but with the riots going on and him being a firefighter and his mother telling me he said the therapist is getting him to open up I want to reach out so bad. Can yall share your stories and give me any insight on his possible feelings or what people did in my own personal shoes? He is the love of my life and losing him has been the hardest thing Ive ever experienced. He also has never dealt with depression before so its entirely new for him. Thank you for anyone and everyone that can help or atleast share their own experiences.",
    "Am I a disappointment?? So, Ive been on tinder for some time now. I have match with several girls and had a conversation with only 2. Each one Ive talked, it seemed like that they might have an interest in me, but that may be the desperation in me since Ive never had a date or girlfriend in my 21 years of existence. After some time passes, they both just completely stop talking to me like I dont exist. I feel like once they stop talking to me, they think Im just another random person. All I want is one girl to date and do stuff with. Im not trying to get into their pants. I personally think that Im a huge disappointment, even tho I have a lot of potential in life.",
    "Morning depression and how to handle it. Hello everyone. This is my first post in this sub. I was wondering, does anyone have any methods or anything to make morning depression go away? I sleep and wake up at the same time every day so I dont think that theres any problem in that regard. I also do exercise and eat well but the symptoms dont let up. Ive seen that these can be symptoms of major depression but I dont know how could that be, since I feel pretty good the rest of the day. Maybe some days are worse than others but idk. It hurts a lot. Every morning Im scared of waking up since I know that anything will make me feel depressed. Oh you have online classes? How about thinking that you should drop out because you have zero motivation to do any schoolwork? Youre watching a reality show? How about thinking that you are worthless and that you will never find a girlfriend since youre stuck in your house all day? Its tiring to be feeling this way every morning, and what my therapist asks me is just at what time of the day do I get depressed so that he can find the cause. But the thing is, that cause can be literally anything.",
    "Feels like I’m brain dead Hey, I was a rather intelligent individual due to the fact that I was able to achieve an IQ of 140 on the Mensa test. From the grades I got in high school I also got admitted to Cs and engineering at a good university and thats what Ive been studying now for about 3 weeks. But for months, Ive been feeling that my brain function and my mental reasoning ability has decreased drastically. I am now struggling with math problems that I used to ace in high school, and I have a hard time learning and especially remembering things even though I study a lot. This is taking a toll on me! My memory has worsen significantly to the point that I need to write things down in order to remember it. I even need to search up simple words because I have either forgotten what the word actually was, how to spell it or the meaning of the word. And this happens every single day. My depression comes in waves and when it was really fucking bad couple months ago I was going insane. It has now calmed down a bit and I have absolutely no clue if my symptoms are caused by my depression or if there is a hidden underlying condition that I dont know about. Has anyone experienced this?",

    "I don't know what to do at this point other than end it. Nothing has helped so far. Its in my genetics. I have a hard time focusing on or doing anything, whether it be school or things outside of school. This includes hobbies or being with friends. My grades are piss poor right now, which adds to my guilt and depression. I want to do my work and make my teachers proud, but I havent been able to focus onunderstand the lessons and I lose all of my stuff a lot. Around the age of 11 or 12, I developed severe anxiety and panic attacks. I was constantly in a state of such anxiety that almost anything could set off a panic attack. I would hyperventilate and cry until I threw up, and would occasionally shit my pants in fear. I was also severely depressed I had no energy or motivation to do anything. I would hurt myself every day. Around this time I also realized that I had gender dysphoria and was bisexual. I told my mom about all of this, because as a 12 year old youre supposed to go to your mom about your problems. She shamed me, she blamed me, she screamed at me. I had to threaten to hurt and kill myself to get her to do anything to help me. My panic attacks have since tapered off, and I dont have them as often now. However, my mom thinks I am not trans and that I am straight. I suppressed both my gender and sexuality for years, but my gender dysphoria has come back tenfold. Im too scared to tell her but.. I cant live as a woman. My grades have been pretty not great since 9th grade. Im really smart still, I just have a really hard time paying attention in class and am too depressed to do my assignments. With enough effort not much I can pull As in most of my classes, and at the very worst a low B, but nowadays, I dont have the energy to put out that effort anymore. Im looking at a solid D in every class I have. I unfortunately have attempted suicide twice. My mom got really angry at me both times and didnt console me in any way. Just blamed me.",

Those 3 months were the worst days of my life, now I just wish I dont have to go through those things again. Im scared of next year because it feels like it might happen again, and I might succeed.

    "Severe anxiety and depression Most of my life I have suffered with depression, anxiety, self deprecating thoughts and worse case scenario imagery in my head almost nonstop. Its like a movie that never stops playing. I currently take 120 mg daily of CBD spread throughout to help manage my symptoms. Is there any hope for me to be alright without taking so much medication. To put it in imagery, It really feels like its a python constantly wrapped around my neck and When I take medication, I feel it let go for a while but can also still feel it just sitting there in the corner waiting for it it wear off so it can pounce right back on and keep strangling me. I need a long term solution. it has gotten so bad that I cant stop taking the CBD for more than a day without experiencing severe mental distress. Sometimes I cannot even function without it. When I took CBD for the first time it was also the first time I had ever felt normal. I am grateful to have this medication but at the same time I do not want to have to depend on this for the rest of my life. I just want the normal brain chemistry that other people seem to take for granted. Having a normal day for me is so rare its like finding buried treasure for me. And then I want to stay normal so bad and hold on to that good feeling that ironically, I bring the anxiety back about trying to stay feeling normal. It almost feels hopeless. Is there any hope that I can ever have a normally functioning mind without taking large amounts of medication? At this point my liver just has to take the hit because for my mind to feel the way it does without it I cant keep going like that.",
    "Can't eat or drink In the middle of a pretty bad depression spiral right now and just cant eat. after two days of not eating, I started a food log to make sure that I am at least getting enough for basic survival, and installed an app on my phone to remind me to drink water, but it is just getting harder to ingest anything. I saw these weird emergency ration bars that seem to have all the calories nutrients you need for a day in a few small bites and ordered those. I dont know if they will help or anything, but its becoming harder every day. I feel like a failure for not being able to do basic human things, which only pushes the depression spiral further. I find myself playing this sick game where I see how long I can put off eating or drinking, which is really just a facade to make me feel like I have some control over the matter. I just dont know what to do anymore to not feel this awful. I only have two modes anymore, sad and numb, and I am just so damn tired all the time. I constantly find myself wishing for someone to just come out of the shadows and kill me, since I cant seem to do it myself. Maybe the loss of appetite is my body trying to do it for me. Im just so tired and want it all to stop.",
    "Depression and Anxiety firing up and causing me to feel like I might have a panic attack. So this may just be the anxiety firing up and causing me to stress and panic. Ive had trouble in the past with lonliness, both my parents have kicked me out Because of me wanting a better job, and Ive had friends in the past all of a sudden drop me or stop talking to me frequently, this left me feeling alone quite alot of the time and causing me to worry about upsetting any friends I do make. I managed to make about 3 friends that I talked to regularly, one of those friends started being really horrible, majority of the time to me and I started to get fed up of it. I called him out on it and this has resulted in me and that guy Call him Ed not being friends, however wed end up in the same rooms chatting on discord because of me being friends with the two other friends, A and B, and Ed joining occasionally. Well recently Ed and B have started chatting more and more often and A and me talking more, however in recent rooms, me and Ed have started arguing because of the way he still tries to treat me, B has recently started acting slightly more like Ed as well, which is causing me concern and ended up with me and B having a small argument earlier today. My anxiety is spiking however because, B is talking less and less to me, and now A has started to disappear a bit more, I worry that I will end up lonely again, without anyone to talk to, as it took me over a year to make these friends after the last group of friends I had all left in one big hit.

I dont know what else to do at this point. This has been a 16 year journey to find freedom from depression with no distinguishable positive results, unfortunately  not even a little bit. Ive followed through to completion with ketamine infusions, 10 different medications for depressionanxietyadhd, neurofeedback biofeedback treatments, Ive seen 8 different therapists, a handful of psychiatrists, life coaches, psychoanalysts. Ive taken psychedelics. Occasionally with a new drug or treatment, I break free momentarily  I feel infinitely less burdened  I feel hope  this usually only lasts a day or at the very, very most a few days... I always, always fall back to where I was again. I force myself out of sheer will to exercise and eat healthy every day, that definitely helps  without that, I would be so much more miserable. But the fog is still there. the selfdefeating thoughts still there  nothing is ever good enough. I still feel so stuck, unmotivated, and deprived of life. I heard of TMS Therapy  I spent the last of my savings on the ketamine infusions so I cant afford them right now, even with insurance. Im terrified it will only work for a bit of time, then Ill have thrown away thousands of more dollars in the process. I am not a quitter.. I have no desire to end my life.

Hi guys, I really dont feel up to formatting or putting it neatly, but Ive been struggling a lot. In my recent quest for a therapist via insurance  its a hassle more and more issues keep popping up that has worsened my mental and emotional health. Ive been having darker thoughts, thoughts of hurting myself really badly, of ctting and oftentimes when Im riding my bike, how itd feel to ride into traffic and get hit. Sicidal thoughts nearplague me weekly, and while Im trying so desperately to be better, theres something around the corner that brings my decent to good mood down to sad or angry or confused, and its all been so much.

I want to be there for them, too! But its hard! I have no energy! Everything feels scary and tiresome and I feel so dreadfully lonely in my interpersonal relationships.

    "First time in forever. Hi. Hope everyone is well. Recently Ive been diagnosed with manic depression disorder and anxiety disorder at the age of 18. I think Ive always known Id be struggling ever since I was about 15. Just a little context, 2020 was a weird year. I started off having the worst manic episode ever to a point where I lost 4 stones, considering i was already skinny. Then i got back on my feet, I was eating healthy and working out and even enjoying the air. Some things happened during that summer that traumatised my brain. It put me in a bad place as I went to college and was not enjoying it at all. Im already seeing a therapist and its helped but it never feels like it majorly helped, it just feels like someone there to talk to. Now im here, with failed relationships in my family, no friends, horrible sleep pattern and constant pain. for the first time I feel hopeless. How do you recommend I get out of this lump and state that I cant even get up to go get my prescription? For the first time in forever I genuinely believe I cant help myself and i feel stuck. What do i do?",

    "High functioning depression Hi everyone, Ive been lurking in depression subreddits for a while but I finally decided to post. I have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and clinical depression. I was diagnosed when I was 17 but since I started university my depression has become more high functioning, and there have been times when people do not believe me when I open up about my depression. Even when I talked about my PTSD from a sexual assault and a mentally abusive relationship, some people did not believe me. I shower two times a day every day, I finish all my assignments a week ahead of time and I make sure I get near perfect grades on everything, I work 56 days a week, Im a clean freak who has to do laundry and dishes every single day or else I panic. My anxiety disorder screams at me to get these things done or else my anxiety will eat me alive. Ive had people who tell me my depression isnt real because their depression had them unable to leave their bed. When I talked about my struggles with suicidal thoughts I was skirted to the side and seen as a liar, while someone else was praised for their struggles because they were unable to continue going to college due to their depression. I felt like screaming that depression is not a contest. It ruins lives and there is no one size fits all depression. I just need support that my struggles are valid.",

    "I'm unsure whether I sexually harassed somebody or not, and as a result, I'm extremely depressed. Hi, guys. Im a 23 yearold man with Aspergers Syndrome, and one of the two themes of my pureO OCD over the last two years has been a fear of doing something sexist  this is a manifestation of the moral scrupulosity element of OCD. For the first time ever last summer, I sent a flirtyprovocative text to a woman via the Ask feature on Tumblr, while nonanonymous. The message was an abbreviation followed by a question mark. I remember the post I found her through specifically saying that she was open to receiving these types of messages, yet my brain is trying to convince me that this is false, and obviously because its been so long now, I cant remember what her blog is called and have felt a compulsive need to find her, but cant. I want to die, because I dont want to live with the shame and guilt associated with having potentially sexually harassed somebody, but Im so very certain that she was soliciting these messages, as well as answering similar messages from men on her blog and being receptive to them. This is what my recollection was last September when I first reflected on it. I wasnt trying to be strange at all, I was trying to be more confident than I had usually been in this circumstance.

Initally she just asked for advice regarding a crush of hers who already is in a relationship. When talking to her about it tho, she told me a few things that really got me worried. On the one hand, she feels understood by him. She feels like herself around him and like she doesnt have to fake her happiness. On the other hand, she admitted to sending him nudes, as he told her Id be okay to send some from time to time and it could even be there hot little secret Needless to say, Im really worried now. I gave her the advice to stay away from himstop contact with him and also came to an agreement, that her and I would look for a psychologist at the same time so niether of us feels like a crazy person needing psychiatric help lol Still, Ill continue to try and help her. I already thought about asking her how she feels although it is incredibly hard for her to open up about her feelings, but also motivating her to go out or try something new or something. Just fyi I never met her personally, she lives about two hours away. We do talk jokingly about meeting up some time soon tho, so maybe Ill see her soon.

    "My breakup is killing me Sorry about the melodramatic title, but this really is what it feels like. Ill try to keep this story short, however I could keep on talking for hours and if someone one this sub was willing to have a talk with me by PMs Id love to because Im just so incredibly lonely right now. About a week ago my girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me. It was a stupid breakup and I feel like my behaviour is the reason for why we broke up, even though she too made plenty of mistakes. When I lost her I once again realized how much she meant to me and that I didnt want to lose her at any costs so I tried to get her back. But all I got were meanspirited messages saying how she doesnt miss me, shes realized were incompatible and that shes glad I moved out. Some days ago I created a tinder profile because I thought itd help me get over her. Guess what, first evening on tinder I saw her profile. And it fucking killed me inside. The next days, she would routinely put some nice clothes on and leave, while I was stuck in the living room watching her leave to some tinder gate, and it killed me. Thats when I realized I had to leave.. so while she was at work I packed up all my stuff and left, leaving her one last voice message that I cant take the situation and that I still want her back. Thats when I got her meanspirited message. I feel like she was all I had. People I talk to are telling me to distract myself with things that are fun to me, but frankly, I dont know whats fun to me anymore. Watching tv shows? Gaming? Playing the guitar? I feel like watching shows and gaming are just occupational therapy to me. I used to love playing the guitar, at least I think so, but nowadays I feel so fucking bad whenever I play that its hard to call it fun either. Sports? Ive gained some weight so I decided I wanted to lose 10kg. That was a week ago, the same day she broke up with me in fact, its kind of the reason why we got into the fight responsible for our breakup.",
    "Awful nightmares and bad sleep So Ive 23f been diagnosed with depression since 18. Meds only semi work and i have a few people i know i can count on as support but over the last couple months Ive been experiencing extreme night terrors. What makes them worse is how realistic they feel, as Im sort of semi conscious when they happen. It makes it harder for me to distinguish whats real and what isnt. Someone im incredibly close to saw me have one, apparently i was crying and thrashing like crazy and when i finally snapped out of it i was a mess for ages even as they held me and tried to bring me back from the horrible head space i was in. Its made me reluctant to sleep as I live at home with parents and sleep alone and when it happens i end up getting no sleep as Im terrified of it happening again so wont try to go back to sleep. Ive tried adapting the mentality of suck it up and forcing myself back to bed after it happens when Im on my own but I struggle to get out of that head space and still lose a good hour or so of sleep before i finally feel comfortable enough to sleep. I was wondering if theres anything i can do when im on my own to calm and ground myself quicker after it happens?",

I explained my thoughts on this matter to him and he told me that he didnt think it through and maybe was overhasty to break up and admitted his actual reason for breaking up were his thoughts going in circles, so he just ended things to stop this  although it seems that this didnt improve anything for him. He said he doesnt know what his feelings for me are but he doesnt want to lose me and a lot of other things none of which sounded like things you tell a friend. I dont know what to do. I want to give him time but as far as I know, hes doing nothing to improve his situation and I cant take this much longer. I know that most people  especially in the relationship subreddits...  probably would just tell me to put an end to this and forget him. To confirm that Im not totally delusional for thinking that we might get back together, Ive talked to some friends... and surprisingly, no one told me to just give up and that theyre confused, too, and also think that his behavior isnt that of just a friend. And now, Im still here because Ive seen that he really cares about me and feels more for me than for a friend. I have the feeling that the actual reason for the breakup and whats standing between us arent not enough feelings or arguments or any other stuff... but his depression. Many people tend to cut people out of their lives too easily and I dont just want to leave this awesome person behind because hes going through a hard time. tldr Boyfriend has depression and broke up with me but still treats me more like his girlfriend than just a friend. His reasons didnt sound like they have much to do with me but more with his depression. Doesnt know what he feels for me but doesnt want to lose me and wanted time to think and work on his problems  but isnt really doing anything. I have the feeling he wants to be with me but his depression prevent him from doing so. Im so confused and dont know what to think or how to help him.",
    "I’m feeling very low energy and demotivated after about a month with Lexapro, spending most of the time in bed. I need help. I started taking Lexapro 5 weeks ago at 5mgday for situational or reactionary depression which isnt a major clinical depression according to my doctor. I had the initial side effects as predicted like sleepiness and vivid dreams, etc. which resolved in a couple of weeks as well as all the negative feelings and dark moods of loneliness etc. plus the anxiety and feeling overwhelmed which have mostly gone, however Ive been feeling extremely unmotivated and low that Im barely making it to work and the rest of the time Im in bed. My sleep was also quite bad feeling unrested in the mornings. Normally I drink one coffee and one tea a day but recently Ive been taking triple shot espressos and Im not feeling any difference. My sugar and carb consumption has also increased. Last Monday when I had my follow up with the doctor he decided to increase the dose to 10mgday. Ive been on 10mgday for almost a week now and probably my sleep quality has improved a little bit but still very very unmotivated and low. Im going through upsetting phases with my family which doesnt help and while I had managed to keep my life under control for a while, things have got out of hand again and my room is a total mess. Ive been pushing myself to get things done but Im making no progress. Theres barely any space in the room to walk. My next follow up is on Friday but I dont want to stay miserable till then.

    "Do I have depression or something else? Hi everyone, please dont bite my head off as Im pretty new to all this but Im trying to figure out if what Im feeling is depression or not. I recently realised that Ive not been feeling okay for quite a few years, I googled some stuff and depression came up. Now I dont really trust random stuff thats written online so I thought the best thing to do was to speak to some people with depression on here and see if my symptoms fit? no motivation to get out of bed, if my parents didnt force me to get up then Id probably stay there until the late afternoon. I always like Ive been a disappointment, that Im a failure and that Ill always be this way later in life  I find it very hard to focus on anything, my attention span is very low. I fidget and become aggiated pretty easily  I quite often find it hard to get to sleep, Ill end up staying awake until the early hours of the morning. I spend almost all day in my room. I feel empty, lonely and sometimes start crying over the past or present. sometimes I make myself cry on purpose when Im alone, I dont quite understand why I do that. I find it hard to motivate myself to do basic things such as washing or brushing my teeth. I do them for my own good but it takes effort and I sometimes neglect those tasks. I sometimes think about death. I find it hard to care about anything. Then if I make a mistake over something I do find the energy to care about, I beat myself up about it harshly.",
    "How do I make a female partner who's depressed feel better? repost because i forgot to use my alt Hey guys. So Im hanging out with my girlfriend on Friday, who is depressed and may have some sort of bpd issues as pointed out by multiple redditors.

I was hoping to get everyones advice on how I should talk to her. ampx200B I want to make clear that they does not think shes depressed, but all symptoms are there. irritability, feeling of emptiness, mood swings, sadness, sometimes excessive substance intake. they even admitted they were depressed a while ago and had thoughts of killing or harming herself. ampx200B I am worried about her and if she wont accept and get help herself, Im trying to see how I can make things better.

She goes out with some friends who are moving away 4. when shes back, we hang out again and maybe watch our favorite tv show. 5. play some kind of video game or just talk Are any of you able to tell me what else I can do to make my partner feel happier?

I have many friends I have fun with them, but I miss so much having someone that I can sleep with, make love to, cuddle etc. The thing is that I can actually flirt and I can talk easily no matter with anyone no matter what.

    "Everything Feels Too Overwhelming I feel overwhelmed at the slightest things. This has been happening for a long, long time but it just keeps getting worse. Some days are better than others. Today is a bad day. I quite my job in January to live my dream of being a fulltime artist. I am failing so hard. Yes, COVID really impacted everything but if Im being completely honest, I was never cut out for this to begin with. Ive taken on commissioned work that is months overdue because the thought of starting is so overwhelming. I keep telling myself, tomorrow I will start and I feel relieved. I wanted to make art today first time in months and even got excited at the idea of going to the art store, but then I just thought it will just be another piece that sits there and goes unfinished. I killed all of my excitement before I even did anything. This isnt me. I used to love to create art more than anything and spent almost every spare second painting. I havent started and I feel guilt and shame everyday. I feel stuck. I cant start and I feel like absolute shit for my behaviour. I also run an online vintage shop. I built the new website back in February and was SO proud and excited about it. I havent touched it since. I want to, I want to work on it, but now I have SO many pieces of clothing that need to be cleaned, photographed, listed, measured, that its again....overwhelming. I cant bring myself to start and just look at all the beautiful clothing just sitting there every single day. Some days I scroll through my phone for hours because Im looking for a sign or a solution. Im wasting my life. I hate feeling this way. I hate living this way. Im unhappy no matter what I do and Im feeling SO much guilt for letting so many people down. Im 30 years old too old to be acting this way. Its so shameful. I also keep thinking that its too late for me to make any changes. Whats the point in trying to do better if I havent already figured it out by now.",
    "Am I really THAT bad? San Francisco Merola  Houston Grand opera  Chautauqua Opera  pensacola opera  Pittsburgh opera  Washington National  Wolf Trap  Palm Beach  Florida Grand Opera ALL of them REJECTED me!httpsimgur.comgallery3M3xXRI Was I really that bad? After 20 years of singing and study, was I really so bad that each and everyone of these companies decided to reject me? No more empty compliments, was I honestly that bad of a singer that every company I applied for had to reject me?httpsyoutu.beHjnDEBoHPUA Opera is the only thing in this miserable world that gives me any meaning to my life. I dont want people to say life is supposed to be meaningless, I dont want people to say that there will be a next time, And I dont want people to reassure me of anything anymore. Rejecting me from each of these companies was somebodys decision, and I want to know exactly why they made it against me! Was because they are doing diversity hiring and couldnt fit a white person into their principal lineup? Was it because Im a military veteran, and someone looked me up to make a stink about it? Was it because I have trouble getting social media followers? Was it because Im autistic? ANSWER ME GOD DAMNIT! This isnt about how I feel, this is about what these people are doing to me, and I want to know why they are doing it to me after I have earned my place! I have been living with depression, anxiety and tendencies for the last 15 years, trying to rebuild my life. People always say bull crap like dont give up. Well Ive brought back the latest result of not giving up! And Im putting them out there so that the assholes who make those kind of lies can fix this! Ive posted my audition results from every company to whom Ive submitted this audition season, to show you that telling me not to give up isnt changing their decision to reject me! I want a change in this! I want these companies to relay to me exactly why they rejected me so that I can improve, Or else I want them to change their decisions, So that not giving up becomes a reality for me as much as it does for anybody else you tell it to!!!",
    "I'm 16 and I'm a mess When I discovered that one of my favorite games was hugely hated on the internet, it made me feel miserable, like my taste was inferior, like I was so dumb to like that thing. I spent, no, waisted so much time defending that game online, and it left me with a terrible sour taste in my mouth when playing it afterwards, like the voices of the people criticizing me were echoing in my head, telling me how stupid I was, how wrong I was to like that game. I eventually didnt even finish it. I couldnt play it anymore. And it keeps going. It still happens, I still get that hot feeling in my head when someone hates on something I love and Im passionate about, I feel dumb and I wonder, I wonder if everyone is like me on that regard? Or is there something wrong with me? Is there something wrong with all of us? Im not even clearly sure about the mental illnesses that I have. I feel like I made so many mistakes, so many unachieved things, so many failures in my life,that may not seem much, and Id agree, but mean so much to me, I feel like I have so many flaws, and those thoughts, sometimes, theyre so loud, theyre like screams. And my throat is so sore that I cant scream louder than them, so I just want to be deaf. Sometimes I just want to end it all. I regret so much things I did, so much things I didnt, so much things I said, so much things I couldve said.. my mind feels poisoned, to the point where it can physically hurt. Im slowly heading to become a social failure, with no lover, no friends and no job. My grades are dropping, I dont do any work, sometimes Im so tired at school that all of my body hurts from it litteraly, its a horrible feeling. Its a bit more complex than that too, I cant describe it but I hate it very much. everyone keeps mocking me, sometimes for stuff I dont even understand. Im slowly becoming paranoid of doing anything in public, like Im always doing something wrong and poeple will laugh at me, its like Ive been put in a game I dont know the rules of.",

    "Nothing makes me happy anymore This year has been pretty rough for me. I had complications with an IUD I had put in and needed surgery to remove it as Ithe doctor put it in wrong. I had a scare with mold damage to where I was living, I threw out a bunch of clothes and had to wash everything in hot. I had a scare with bed bugs and had to freeze everything and dry in hot. I broke up with my boyfriend because he didnt want to see me anymore. I have had a lot of health problems and the doctors think I might have something serious I worry that its cancer. The only thing good going for me is my grades and thats because I literally put any energy I have that doesnt go towards aimlessly panicking and googling whatever my mind wants to worry over towards my grades. Lately I am in a endless state of paindue to my medical problems and I just dont feel happy anymore. I remember two years ago when I was actually happy and I was able to laugh at things or feel content. I just feel weird. My days are lonely... I dont have a boyfriend, family, friends,pets. My family lives far away, I wish I saw them more...but im too poor to travel. I just leave the house to go to school, come home, take tylenol then study. I got a scholarship which should have made me happy but I just didnt feel anything. My first thought was actually well if I have cancer this scholarship wont really matter. I keep thinking that im not going to live for very long. When people talk to me or try to make jokes I force a smile and it feels so weird because Im focusing on trying to look normal and happy so people cant see that im actually emotionless. How I am is starting to scare me a little bit like Im worried it might get worse. I tried seeing the school counseller but that didnt really help me as it made me uncomfortable talking about my anxiety.",
    "How should I do this 'homework' from a therapist Hello, I am struggling with some pieces of homework between sessions that the counsellor has given me. These are the tasks 1. Call my friends and tell them how I feel. 2. Ask 10 people to describe me in three words. Im struggling with both of these because  Im a 26yearold man. I was not brought up to have  much less talk about  feelings. Sure, trying to break that sounds great in theory but one of my friend group tried that a year or two ago and none of us knew what to say or do at all. We felt so awkward and just left it. Some of our friend group just said this guy had had a few bad days and was blowing it out of proportion not nasty but none of us know how to handle it. Family are out of the question sadly as they always become very angry with me for mentioning feelings  Telling friends I feel bad during a coronavirus pandemic is incredibly selfish weve all got problems  It would also be proving them right theyve been hassling me contsantly to come home even though itd be illegal to socialise with them in person anyway RN, so kinda pointless. Ive told them I feel better away from my parents for a bit longer, plus I can work on an essay Im writing for uni. I live in a student area and students dont seem to be panicbuying like other groups, so i just feel more comfortable here. Saying I feel bad despite feeling this way for 15 yearsish would just increase their feelings that I ought to move in with the parents. Im vehenmently against this  I know it sounds like Im being critical and just shitting on the counsellors ideas, but I dont think Im going to be able ot do these tasks  Im worried about disappointing the counsellor. Weve had two sessions and at the end of each he has asked me what I found most useful and because Im not really sure what to say I just say the first thing that comes to mind. We talked for 20 minutes about problems Ive had about my appearance and being bullied for being ugly for aroun 15 years now and he seemed to think by the end of the conversation that I was healed.",

But here I am again having no energy for personal relationships, fighting the urge to end all of my friendships because I just dont want them. Its not urges to just end the friendships, but destroy friendships, burn all bridges. My work was being affected and I took a day off on Tuesday just because I didnt want to be there. I have never taken a day off for no reason. I am sure this will pass and Ill be fine again. But what do I do in the meantime? What do I say when people ask if everything is ok? Or when they say something is up with me? There is literally nothing for me to be upset about right now. I am afraid I am going to come off whiny or just self pitying.",
    "I’m just tired and want to feel nothing Ive never done a reddit post or anything before but essentially Ive been depressed for over 10 years 20 now and Im just really tired. For a brief summary Ive always struggled with family dad I dont get along with is an arse, mom who is mentally unstable herself but is in denial and is far to kind to the point that it hurts everyone the type to constantly be ripped off but to do the exact same thing again and again, exstep dad who made false promises and has gone off the edge of the earth, exstep mom whose a 14yr bitchy girl stuck inside a womens body, older sister who is very over opinionated and its her way or the high way and a little sister who is young enough that shes missed most the trauma but I dont get to see often because she lives with my dad I dont want to get into it because its a long story that has lasted all my life. Ive always really struggled with friends. I find it really hard to make them and when I did I would often get hurt so now theres just a wall. And Ive just really struggled with myself. All the usual low self esteem, anxiety, paranoia, depression. Im keeping it brief since I feel like I can write a book. Im a really lonely person and have been for a long time and I know its because Ive just never had a proper normal relationship with anyone. My family dont talk about emotions and all that and with all the trauma Ive always been very closed off with them ready to bolt as soon as I can. And since Ive always struggled with friends Ive just never had anyone around I have friends now but were just not good friends Im unsure how to explain it. Ive also never had a boyfriend so its always felt like just me. Im very used to people abandoning me so Im closed off. My depression has also just killed the things I love as it often does and I really struggled to enjoy anything or find motivation for it. I went to uni this year and dropped out after a month and still havent got a job. Ive been applying but havent made any cuts and for the one I made the cut for I couldnt do cause my anxiety was so bad.",

Im about ready to just delete her number from my phone and ignore her texts, maybe shell eventually get the hint.

I also laugh at jokes even if theyre not funny because its less awkward than sitting there in silence and not knowing what to say I constantly do weird shit like talk really loudly or in different accents again, it might be because I want people to think Im funny I dont think before I speak.

    "I feel like a waste and I don't know what to do. Where do I begin? I guess to start, I recently got engaged to the love of my life back in June youll see why this is important in a second. I am also in a very demanding work industry, in education. Special Education to be more specific. I love working with kids and it can be very rewarding, however, its the most taxing job. My fiancé is a very supportive person while also keeping me realistic. My dream is to stream and I used to and it was fairly successful, to my surprise, when I started. I gained a lot of followers, viewers, and even a few donations even though thats not why I started to do it. My stream was focused on just having fun doing hobby and trying to shine light on mental health. My 1 passion in life is to help others. And I have tried to find careers that revolve around that, but to much dismay. So my stream was to offer advice when asked, listen, and just talk. Talking helps. Even talking about random things. Anyways, she supported me while I did this during the summer. I knew it bugged her that she had to go to work every day and I got to stay home and fulfill a passion of mine. I am drowning at work and it has completely taken over my life. I find no joy in my old hobbies. Watching sports, playing video games, hanging with friends, etc. This past week my fiancé told me that I remind her of a hermit. I hate going out, hanging with friends, all that. I hate having fun is what she told me. Frankly, I realized this before she had told me. Furthermore, I am faced with the decision of resigning from my job and chasing my dream. The repercussions of this is that there wont be stable income coming from me, my fiancé doesnt make enough right now to support us both and we talked about it. We were looking to buy a house in the next year, as well. I feel like Im a waste though. Do I just nut up and suffer just to achieve the goal of getting a house?",
    "12 years... Entire life changed in 24 hours. My living wife and I agreed to a divorce after 12 years. I stopped being the man she fell in love with. I never knew why. And its absolutely amazing how I can see every single detail why after I left that house. Last Saturday. Scared, depressed and lonely. We never had counseling and this is the first time I have been away from her in 12 years. Im refraining from pouring my guts out to her, I know that she needs her space. I understand that. Im praying that she sees hope for us yet like I do. I actually scheduled online counseling for myself. I have to be fixed for her first if she ever wants to try and work things out. Thats all I want right now...is to be back with her. I havent felt pain like this...ever. Thats how I know I love her, and she loves me, she said that right before I left with a huge hug...",
    "Nothing is right in my life. I don't know if I can be fixed. Im a 21 year old guy and Id say Im at the end of my rope but Im too scared to do anything stupid. Ive tried dealing with my depression by putting in place a sleep schedule, eating extremely clean, and exercising daily. It hasnt helped. I feel tortured by my existence. Its like this is one cruel dream I cant wake up from and the only thing I look forward to is going to sleep to escape from the unsolvable problems in my life and in my head. In the past 2 years my mom, grandma, and dog have died. Ive gotten very sick multiple times and I feel like it gave me brain damage. I cant focus. I went from being a straight A college student to failing multiple classes. Organizing my thoughts is tedious and having the motivation to even think about assignments is a real struggle. I keep putting back on weight and then losing it and gaining it back because I fall into habits that I cant completely break. I live in a run down shack taking care of an elderly person and tiptoeing around my abusive father. I work 3035 hours a week and still cant afford to be on my own. At work I make a mistake every 45 seconds because i cant focus on what needs to be done or analyze the situation. People get angry at me and tell me to just stop trying because I only make things worse. That gets to me the most because I just feel so worthless as it is and now everyone around me is confirming those negative thoughts that I fight so hard to tell myself are just my mind playing tricks. Im literally exactly what I see myself as and the pain that brings make me feel like Im being ripped apart from the inside. I cry myself to sleep, cry when I wake up, and cry in the middle of the day in my car. Theres nothing I can latch onto except for the dim hope that maybe one day Ill feel better and its such a thin line to hold onto. I was both abused and neglected starting at about 5 years old.",
    "I haven’t been happy in so long I look up how to get out of bed all the time. I see sit up as the first step but when I wake up in the mornings I dont want to feel better. I just want to go back to sleep. I sleep all day. I dont have a job and I know my boyfriend is being affected. I feel like a parasite on everyones life. No one benefits from being my friend or being with me. Im literally just a burden. Some of my best friends have even blocked me on social media and honestly Im not even mad. I understand. I take my anti depressants, Ive been to inpatient hospitals. I literally have no motivation to keep going. I dont want to die but I dont want to wake up anymore. I just want to lay in bed. I have a son. Even though I have no job, he goes to a babysitter. I only watch him twice a week. I love him and I miss him when hes gone but I can barely even take care of him when hes home. I know hes going to grow up to resent me. I wish I was the same person that gave birth to him but I am completely different. Hes such a good kid. Hes so happy I wish I could be a good mom for him. I wish I could be who my family needs me to be. I hate myself. I am terrible for my family. Most of the time I think that staying around is going to be worse for my family than if I just left. I dont know what to do. I want to be happy but Ive tried so many times to heal and the attempts have never gained any happiness.",
    "Didn't go out of bed in the whole weekend Ive been feeling like a piece of trash lately. Im not doing anything for myself. Any free time that i have, i spend it in bed, doing nothing. I only go out to work, and only because I have to, but its getting harder to get through the day as being at work is not easy to tolerate for me. I dont work out anymore, have been skipping meals and either sleep too much or too little. Im paying less attention to myself and my responsibilities and Im worried this is gonna ruin my life sometime soon. What should I do?",
    "Hair loss The past year of my life has been a rollercoaster of hell type emotions. I have went through a lot and my hair seems to be paying for it. About 5 months ago, my hair started shedding like crazy. It wasnt as bad as the previous month. Everytime I touch my hair I lose about 1015 strands. I have never had hair loss as great as this and I suspect it has to do with my depression and anxiety. Are there any tips and tricks I can use to salvage my hair ?",
    "I feel like my efforts are pointless I started going on daily walks like about a month ago because everyone kept telling me how its some kind of magic solution to my depression. I tried being consistent with going outside a lot of times before but I always found myself stopping after maybe 3 or 4 days. But this time I managed to keep it up for a month and I definitely like its an accomplishment, at least. At first it was hard to get used to but after a week I felt somewhat okay with it and no longer felt like I was forcing myself to do it. But now I just cant help but wonder why Im doing any of it. It doesnt really make me feel any better. Im still the depressed old me. And its not like I lost some weight either. Maybe Im expecting too much within a short time but honestly I still doubt it will do much even in the long run.",
    "Fell back into binge eating, not taking care of myself, oversleeping.. Spiraling. Hi guys, Like the title states.. I fell back into my depression spiral 2 weeks ago after getting fired at work. It started with just the binge eating part, but then i started neglecting my hygiene again, not showering, not leaving my house, ignoring everyone.. Started oversleeping and eating like crapnot exercising made me feel awful physically and very worn out. I gained 5 or so pounds, i skipped working out for 2 weeks and my sleep schedule is messed up either sleeping 2 hrs or up to 14, no inbetween. My anxiety due to low confidence is back full force. I know i shouldnt be hard on myself, but i feel awful. Any tips on how to get back on track?",
    "I don’t know where to post this but I need help... Im sick and Im scared. I dont know if its COVID19, I had my test the other day and I had a small freak out. My anxiety is through the roof. I live with my parents right now because I cant afford the rent at this time and my dad has COPD. Im not good mentally... the only thing helping me is writing and drawing and not thinking about it... But distractions can only take you so far... What do I do? Edit Im self quarantining myself to one room or the outside porch, so I hope I wont give it to anyone",
    "I thought college was supposed to be better Everyone always told me that when you get to college, everything is better. You meet more people like you, you make so many friends, and every thing is great. But ever since Ive gotten here I feel like my depression has spiraled out of control. I look around and see everybody seemingly having a good time and I feel like shit I should have more friends and I should go out more but instead Im just stuck with nothing and no one. I am so, so lonely and I just feel as if no one cares. Everybody else has made so many friends, theyve all gotten significant others, theyve all found their niche, and Im just here. I am just so, deeply sad. I just dont know what to do anymore.",
    "Someone to talk to My lifes going downhill rn and I do not have a single person to talk to, I cant cry or anything, pretty numb all of it. I just feel like I could burst any moment, I know its my fault that I dont have anyone to talk to but it hurts a lot knowing that Im pretty much alone at this point, I might not even make it. Only thing keeping me alive was a quick extreme manic episode where i was going insane. Now I just feel empty inside, my brain thinks its good this way and justifies all the things that are happening. Constant intrusive thoughts in my head and I feel like Im on a bad drug trip. This isnt really important, I just feel like venting a little bit. I might just force myself back into an extremely overly happy mindset and just distract myself as much as possible. Basically what Im trying to ask how does one cope with being alone? How do you deal with feelings when you cant talk about any of it? Ive thought about taking some pills to help me calm down because its getting annoying.",
    "I'm seriously considering suicide again. My grandparents the ones alive clearly cares more for my cousins than me, and they dont necessarily hide that. My dad compares me to his former self, and acts like I dont put enough or any effort and treats me like a literal pet. People actively avoid me, because my personality is just straight up fucked, and I act so weird, almost pathetic around others, that Id rather stay at home than humiliate myself in front of others. My biggest problem and fear is that Ill slowly become my father, because he is the most despicable human being I can think of. He is just such a hypocrite, miserable, selfjustifying, rationalizing, condescending piece of shit but I am so similar to him, whether it be personality, tastes, interests, points of view, etc. Another big fear of mine is that no one will validate my efforts, despite it being my best. But its already becoming true. Im just tired of nobody loving me. I had this one girl that I liked since 5 years ago. We were friends or so I thought, Ive discovered a few months back that shes not just not interested in me, but she absolutely despises me. I trusted her with some deepest feelings that I havent shared with anyone, and I have a feeling shes making fun of me for it with her friends, as I can feel them being very condescending towards me, and making fun of me or just ignoring me. I just think that this is unfair. I dont know how to approach people hell, Ive never gotten a kiss in my life, when 90 of the people my age I know already have boyfriendsgirlfriends. Although, I want a more serious, emotional kind of relationship, even though Ill never even get into one, I dont know how to get better and meet everyones expectations including mine, and I dont know what to do in general. Ive felt even more pathetic during my 2 weeks in Chicago, and I dont know anymore if I want to go to the US for college after I graduate this year if I make it out, Im going for a neurologypsychiatry double major, and a linguistics minor or certificate. I have not decided how I want to go yet.",
    "To medicate or not.. About 2.5 years ago I was diagnosed with depression  anxiety no biggie. It runs in the family, its a biological depression as one side of the family doesnt produce enough serotonin, so nothing actually happened to me to set it off. But it affected a lot of things that I wanted control over, I wasnt living my best life. I went on medication Venlafaxineffexor, and it helped dramatically. Though I gained 15kgs in the 6 months. So I came off. Ive been good for 2 years, I got the weight back down, and Im hovering between average and athletic. But recent changes in my life have stirred the pot. Mirtazapine is a recommendation that should work differently and not cause the weight gain. I dont want to go on the meds again if Im going to gain that weight back so fast. I dont want to be on meds my whole life like my family members. But nor do I want to stay like I am currently. So how do I decide? Flip a coin? My psychologist and psychiatrist havent been able to help me make my mind up. Anybody been on mirtazapine? Does it cause weight gain and kill libido? Not that I have a libido at the moment anyway, thanks life",
    "Nothing, and I mean NOTHING helps Do you know whats worse than being depressed and not having your life in order? Being depressed and having your life in order, because if your life is already in order, there is nothing you can improve on and nothing you can do to try and get better meaning there is no hope. My life used to be a mess, but at least I had something to fall back onto. When I told people about my depression, they told me about all the things that helped them out like exercising, extracurricular activities, going out with friends, having good grades, eating well, etc. As someone that couldnt even get out of bed to take a shit, I listened to what everyone told me and did it all. I became an A studentathlete, Im not too good socially but I have a few friends that I talk to and occasionally hang out with, and I lost a lot of weight, but the entire time, I couldnt shake this feeling that everything was off. Theoretically, I should be happy right now, I have become something that I thought was impossible 2 years ago, but it has become clear by now that no matter what I do, I will still want to kill myself. I mean, I feel the same, if not worse than I did 2 years ago. I still stare at my dads pistol every time I walk past it in its case, I still think about cutting myself every time I see a blade. One single thing Ive noticed that has been with me since I was like 7, is that the thought of death is the only thing that brings me comfort in tough times. At this point, I feel like it wont be too long until that thought finally becomes reality.",

But I could tolerate it I thought I could turn it around. But now with all my few friends off to uni Ive been feeling exceedingly low the last few months. Like Im stuck doing something I hate with all my friends going away and no way to make new ones. Ill be honest I really dont know what to do I feel like Ive got no way out I dont really have any hobbies I just used to play video games with mates but like I said theyre all going away. Either way I hate this and want to change and try and turn my life around but Im really lost.

    "Making the same mistake years later. Hello, sorry for a long post. Ill try to keep it as short as possible. Thank you for whoever reads this. Ill start with events 4 years ago when it all started. I am 22 year old male. I used to work in a bar where I met a girl I instantly fell in love with . We got to know each other well, went on dates etc. She was everything I ever wished for. Im from a small village and I have some good friends here. We were always considered to be the bad guys because we partied a lot etc. I never done drugs thought. She always assumed I do drugs and one day I decided to take some to impress her  stupid I know I guess to keep up with the bad guy reputation. Problem is, I fell in love with cocaine. And thats when my life went into a downwards spiral. I started taking cocaine for breakfast everyday. I turned it an angry mess, our relationship slowly got ruined. I was angry at her one day and tried sleeping with her best friend. I was nothing but a scumbag. I was a cheating, lying scumbag. I didnt see that at the time but now its very clear for me to see. She deserved better than me After overdosing once, We broke up and she moved away. I decided I had enough and went sober. I went through some very rough time then. I was very deeply hurt and depressed. Day by day it got better. 4 years have passed and I still never fully got over her even when I was with other girls but I was living more or less fine. I dont really like this town but I have some great friends and reasonably good new job. Anyway, after all these years, last weekend I was out drinking with friends and I met an old friend who offered me a bag of cocaine for some reason i snapped back to my old habits and bought a bag. I knew she was back in town, later on I ended up at a house party where I got in to a very bad state with drugs and alcohol.",

Im a nice dude to everyone else but under the hood Im torturing myself. There have been some things where I felt the only way through was to be meaner than everyone else to me but that 1, wasnt right. And 2, I dont know how to recover.

    "Should I tell any crisis hotline about my suicidal thoughts? I have been having suicidal thoughts for months. I feel I do not want to talk to any of my friends or families anymore because Im hurting them by being depressed. They are supportive but a lot of them cried and my parents get depressed too because Im depressed. Therapy and medication has not been helpful. I might try intensive outpatient programs. I do not know what to do anymore. I text some crisis line sometimes but when they ask me about suicidal thoughts I always say no. Because Im afraid that they will disclose this to my school and when my school knows about this its very troublesome as I have experienced. Or they will call the police to come over.",

It has become normal for me to not like living, and the thought of enjoying life scares me. Im literally afraid of not being depressed somehow. Its like I have to step out of my comfort zone. The thought of not me actually wanting to live feels like I lose my identity, like I have to become a different person.

    "How to motivate myself to start a virtuous cycle? I know that if I exercise, I feel a sense of achievement, I get endorphins from exercising and generally feel a lot more positive about things. I have got a training plan arranged with either running or exercises to do six days a week I thought the accountability would help and I havent done anything for over a week. I feel very little motivation to do anything which isnt helped by the fact its so cold and miserable outside and gets dark quickly.

    "What can I do to have a normal life? My neglectful narcissistic dad has ruined my life. Right now my confidence is lower than ever. Im too self conscious to even go out to the kitchen. Im extremely embarrassed of my body if my blanket is not covering it. I havent talked to anyone besides my parents in over a year except for the time when I had to go to my high school for exams 6 months ago. I dropped out shortly after. I suppress my emotions as much as I can, even when no one is around. When were visiting relatives I pretend to be the perfect little girl, who smiles all the time and loves to study, has big plans for the future, etc. Im worried that if things dont change, Ill just end it all Im not suicidal, so maybe in 56 years?. As of now, Im not a functional human being and I have no use for anyone. I spend the whole day scrolling through reddit, watching videos on youtube and playing minecraft. I want to get a job to get out of here asap, but I cant even look into someone elses eyes without getting a panic attack. I cant keep a conversation going even through texting. Therapy is not an option. The last 3 therapists have ruined my confidence and self esteem even more. I want friends, I want someone to talk to me, I want someone to care about me and I want someone to care about, I want a boyfriend, I want to worry about things people my age worry about, I want to finally live the life I want to.

    "Self-Improvement help After 2.5 years of living with my girlfriend she left. I dont want to get much into detail but up until some months ago relationship was great, then we started having some minor issues, which bummed me out a little. I never told her about it its no big deal, I cant justify being mad about this little thing... I thought. Of course you can figure that these minor issues only began to grew, pushed us apart and ultimately killed the relationship. When we recently talked about this it was already too late, but upon openly talking about the matter I understood her behaviour much better. Probably, if we had talked about that way sooner we could have saved the relationship. The problem is, it is not the first time I do that. I have had previous relationships die for the same reasons. So here I am once again, depressed because my fear of confrontation killed what was the best relationship, by far, that I have ever had. She was such a great girl and I fucked up everything. I also believe that it was not only lack of communication  confrontation fear. When things were going bad the thought of breaking up was constantly in my head. Again, I never told her about it nor decided to take the step myself. This is probably because I dont have many friends and fear solitude. There are a lot of times already when I feel lonely, especially during the latter months, and I didnt want to make matters worse. However, I am almost sure that having this constant break up thought made me unconsciously sabotage the relationship and be more distant. Of course, talking about this stuff earlier on would have probably helped. I am fed up with this, I know that keeping things to myself and other similar behaviours of mine are only going to keep destroying relationships, but its like I cant help it. As I said this is not the first time this happens to me and would probably not be the last one if I dont force myself to change.",
    "I have no one else to talk to Their problems are so much bigger than mine. I usually snag the bathroom for extended periods of time because its the only place I can cry in private. So... I spend a lot of time in the bathroom. I feel like a failure all the time. I couldnt give my partner a house or a honeymoon. I cant afford to get her the treatment she needs and I certainly dont consider getting any for myself because I feel like I can still function on the bare minimum. I cant work two jobs like I used to because my physical health has started taking a nosedive. I know that things could be so much worse for us. Its not like Im ungrateful but I just feel so bad all the time. Im constantly feeling like everyone hates me and sees me as a burden. I feel like I have nothing to show for all the work I do and I cant stop working because we cant afford it. Im lucky to be working from home for now but we return to the office soon. Now being around people in a small room terrifies me because of covid. If I get sick, everything will fall apart for my family. Im so, so very tired. And in mental agony. All the fucking time. I cant afford therapy, i dont even know where to start in finding outside support. Not even sure why Im posting here... I just needed someone to know this. Its not like I want to kill myself or anything, I have too many people depending on me, but sometimes I wish I could go to bed and just not wake up. Everything hurts. All the time.

Im very new to taking antidepressants so i dont want to disregard them just yet so am trying to hopeful about them. I had sporadically seen some therapists over the years but not currently seeing one. my job is okay but Im getting bored with it and I wouldnt know where to go even if I could move to a different one. I guess Im just feeling very lost and down and my motivation just isnt there anymore.

    "First-time depression Hi guys, its my first time on reddit. Im getting kinda depressed right now, mostly because of my disappointments. I put all my hopes and efforts into a competition and now that I failed my expectation was expecting a second prize but got a consolation one. More ironically, my boyfriend got a first prize which was kinda unbelievable and unprecedented in my school for the past 10 years. To make matters worse, he is entering university next year. Helping him with his academic profiles and scholarship applications made me really proud of him but concurrently selfpitiful. I feel a little inferior to him and constantly downplay myself without knowing how to stop. Both events struck me profoundly and Im confused as to what to do. I think recently Im suffering from depression since I have been haunted by selfharm and suicidal thoughts. I have yet to try committing suicide but actually harmed myself with a knife. What can I do to become positive? Thanks a lot",

I just tie what I can back, and no one can tell. Its matted to the extent that the majority of my hair is now just a hard clump of really tightly knotted hair. Its like a hair ball. As the title states, Ive been denied from every hair salon that I called up and were taking customers with proper cautionary COVID measures, and Im starting to accept that I might have to get a buzz cut at this point, which probably wouldnt help with my current mental state. Every hair salon I called 14 total would react in a way that made me feel really embarrassed. Especially because they always as How did it get to that point? or Did you leave gum in it? etc. I told myself I was going to be really open and honest and just tell them I have been suffering from worsened mental health state diagnosed BPD, OCD, amp PTSD in hopes that people are pretty woke now in 2021... Nope. ampx200B I wish it were less embarrassing to ask for help in this situation. Its so hard.",
    "This is a cry for help... I spent the next 8 months completely depressed. I can describe my mood like instead of blood, some sort of black ink was being pumped into my vessels. I spent nights crying and punching the wall. I moved to another town for college. Dated 3 more girls but I couldnt love them and I still wanted that specific girl. I dropped out of college and moved back to my hometown to my family to start studying for the big test again and get accepted in a university. How did that happen? 8 months after my breakup, While I was spending my days and nights depressed as fuck, I saw something on Instagram. A girl from my hometown whom I had a crush on for a year followed me on Instagram. I saw her post and stories to know her better, and she was EXACTLY my type. Her taste in music, her beliefs atheist and her style and her face. She was kinda the one. As Persian names are not familiar to you, I refer to her as Jane. And, I refer to myself Jack. I started talking to her on Instagram, and we hit it off. I reached one of my girlfriends who knew her. And asked her if Jane is single. She said she got back together with one of her ex boyfriends, and that guy is a fucking douche. He had convinced Jane that their breakup was her fault and she needed to grew up. Jane is also 19, and the guy was 20. That guy was driving Jane crazy. He disrespected her in every possible way and didnt care. I saw that as a great opportunity that when they breakup again, I can date her and treat her the way she deserved to be treated. So I waited. But the next day, that friend told me that Jane asked her did Jack say anything about me to you? She said no, but told her that a long time ago she heard from one of her friends that Jack is into Jane. She told me that the moment she told that to Jane, Jane got very happy and excited, and told her that she has a crush on me too. I couldnt believe what I heard. I wanted her but she was into me too?",
    "Should I get myself checked in to a psychiatric ward so they can force me to start my antidepressant? Im having a hard time. My anxiety skyrocketed. Im going through an IBS flare up. I havent had a colonoscopy or gastroscopy yet, but Ive had blood tests, stool tests, ultrasonography and MRI done. All perfectly normal. So there is still a possibility that its something else but its not very likely. Every time I have to poo I get an anxiety attack. I think its a mild one because I dont lose control or pass out, but I get this surge of absolute despair, racing thoughts, I start the breathe shallowly, I start to shake, cold sweats, weird muscle spasms in my body etc. I mean it might be mild but it doesnt feel mild really. Since I poo everyday I get these attacks everyday, sometimes multiple times, sometimes not even triggered by having to poo. A slightly weird feeling in my stomach can cause me to spiral into an anxiety attack. Ive been prescribed Effexor along with Remeron, Ive already been on Remeron but as you can guess I dont think it has any effect on me anymore. It used to work though, it didnt help me too much but I was feeling better. This was a year ago of course. Since then it lost its effectiveness. My psych warned me that I shouldnt look up Effexor online. Unfortunately she was too late since I research antidepressants a lot I already knew its side effects, how does it feel while starting, how shitty the withdrawals are etc. I said ok, because I was desperate. But there is a problem. Its been a while, and I cant bring myself to take my medication. And I know that I have to take it, because there isnt much else left to try. This is not just my opinion, my psych said it herself. So I have to get better. I have to take my medicine to get better, but Im scared of it. The more scared I get the worse my anxiety gets.",
    "Is this a toxic friend I am a shy and private person. Thus as s result i dont have a lot of friends, for a year and half i have been friend with s girl of my sm age i am 19y m. I was really happy to get a friend like her she was supportive and caring but for the past six moths i have noticed that she was not replying to my text , tbh i thought it was fine and thought because of the semester. We are classmates. I have noticed that she only act Friendly when she need to. I thought it was also fine as she may be nervous to ask for favours but for a past month i have noticed that she completely stop texted me just a few days ago she asked about our friendship beyond college. This seems very suspicious. I dont know what have gone wrong. I see her as my friend still. Its okay to break friendship if one party thinks it. The problem lies whenever i ask if she wants to stop me texting she dont reply but actually tries to avoid it. I have now seen it was a weak spot for me. She was my only friend and i am not open to my family. Now because of this my concentration and mental stability is gone i suffer from schizophrenia. I dont know if what happening is real or i am making the stuff up. Anyway despite of knowing everything she is not coming clean. I suspect she dont want me be her friend anymore and its fine, but she is not telling me that because of the help , benifit. I dont know what to do i also cant concentrate on anything i would like to know your advice. As i need a other prospective. tldr how to tell if a friendship is toxic.",
    "Should I hang out with friends while struggling with major depression? An old friend of mine has invited me to go bowling tomorrow evening with him and some other of his friends. I feel a bit reluctant coz well, being Ive been battling major depression  I dont get much enjoyment out of a lot as it is but half of the time I can at least tolerate my mental state everyday Im afraid I wont get much out of it, but being that I havent seen that friend in a number of years and hes going to be in town he lives all the way on the other side of the country a part of me is thinking I should take the opportunity to go.

    "Specific activities to ease loneliness and depression while living alone in the time of COVID? I 23F have been living alone since ending a 4year emotionally abusive relationship in October 2019. I loved my new independence, then quarantine hit. I went through another horrific breakup in March  he broke up with me in a truly cruel way the day before the shelterinplace order hit. My best friends have all moved 100s of miles away to be with their parents during quarantine. After 82 days of basically solitary confinement, I started hanging out safely with acquaintances in June and I visit my parents almost every weekend. Im trying dating apps, but the constant ghosting, mixed signals, and not getting matches is really bringing me down. I have had depression, anxiety, and OCD for 10 years but in quarantine its the worst Ive ever felt. I am an attractive woman, but no one wants to date me and everyone Ive ever dated has either been emotionally abusive or lied to me to get to my body. When I do meet someone who expresses interest, they inevitably ghost me. I just got a prescription for Zoloft because my Citalopram is clearly not working anymore. I am hoping to feel better on Zoloft, but I dont have much hope. A medication will not give me friends, or make men interested in me, or open up all my favorite places that have closed due to the pandemic. Because my depression stems from my unfortunate life circumstances, I am seeking advice on specific things I can do to pass the time and take my mind off of how sht my life is right now. Especially how I can meet other people and hopefully make friends. When everything that I love to do is closed, what can I do to make myself feel happy? BTW, I cannot watch television or movies besides documentaries because it is too painful to see happy people, even if they are fictional.",

I hate everything about myself, I have no redeeming qualities and I feel as if Im a failure to this world and that Im destined to die simply because of natural selection. I have little to no friends and I act like an arsehole but one that cant even throw a punch. I keep hurting myself by cutting my hands, arms and by constantly hitting myself and punching things.

    "I have a problem with getting mental help. My parents are a bit off. If their friend or a family member needs help, they will put their entire life on hold. But if their kids need help, its rarely done. Ive tried for months to get them to make a few doctors appointments. Specifically my psychiatrist. But no matter how many times I ask, it never gets done. In fact, about six months ago, I went to the dentist to get some cavities filled. I had cavities on the top and bottom sets, so, they said that we would have to come to two separate appointments to properly get them filled. Well, we went for the top set, and Ive asked my parents to schedule the second appointment ever since. However, my main concern is going to a psychiatrist. Mainly because for about two and a half years now, Ive had problems with the way my brain functions, and my grasp on reality. I just havent felt right. But in that time, I never considered going to a psychiatrist because i had been to one before, and they did prescribe me medication, so I thought that if there was something wrong, they would have found it years prior. But i spoke with some friends about it and they told me it would be smart to go back. That was a few months ago and I havent been able to convince my parents that I should go back. Its not a financial issue, my insurance covers everything And its not a time issue, neither of my parents are working. My parents are the There aint nothing you cant fix yourself type, and dont understand much about mental help. Its getting so bad that my mother wont hardly talk to anyone because shes either too lazy, to too buried in some kind of device to do anything. Then, when I ask my aunt or grandparents for help, my parents get pissed and complain about how I make them look bad. Dont get it wrong though, they are great in most other regards, but when it comes to me actually needing help, they really dont do much. When it comes to real responsibilities, they are just all around lazy. If anything cant be solved within a minute or two, they wont hardly even look in its direction.",
    "How do I feel human again? For the longest time I have had the issue of feeling like a subhuman or a tool meant to have specific purposes, I have been struggling for the longest time with trying to accept Im a person too and deserve to be treated as such, that Im deserving of love, or to stop putting the needs of others before mine. I wont go into details about what originated this, because frankly no one wants to read Infinite Jest lengths of backstory, but Id like, if anyone can relate, to get some tips on how to ground myself again because Im feeling really, really disconnected from myself lately, even more so than usual, and its very hard to just go thru the motions to maintain the illusion of just being a normal, functional person which I do more for the sake of others than mine tbh. I fear that Ill be exposed as a subhuman and be further alienated from others if I cant keep up the façade and I dont have the time or energy to move elsewhere again to start anew for the nth time. Btw I dont think that tips suggesting hanging with friends or family will work since Im essentially an immigrant all alone in a country other than for his bf, so I dont really have a safety net in a traditional sense and dont want to burden my partner further. I just need a healthier way to cope than drinking it overworking before I break. Please, help me.",

    "Someone else in my skin would be happy, I've no right to be depressed and sinking into alcoholism, yet here I am Im a mid 20s male, college graduate, living in a big city, have a great job. Yet I think about suicide every day. But I feel like I dont have a right to. Other people dont have a lot of the things I have. Im objectively very lucky and have everything I could want to be happy.

The next morning I wake up, go to the gym, and go to work. Then after work I hit the bar again. Alone. Im just so lonely. Why dont people like me. I try not to be an asshole. I really do. I dont think Im an asshole? But I think people are uncomfortable around me. I think I sour their moods. I try not to be negative though. I try really hard. I feel my youth wasting away. I feel the passage of time very heavily. These are supposed to be some great years. Maybe even the best yesrs. Single, big city, acceptably good looking. College certainly wasnt the best years for me. So maybe this is when my life is supposed to peak? But I have no friends. I have no one to hang out with. I dont have a girlfriend. I have no one I connect with deeply. Ive tried cognitive behavioral therapy. But as soon as I stopped going feeling like I was fixed the problems began again. Ive been medicated for depression consistently for years now. Ive even added exercise to my routine at the behest of my doctor. Improved my diet. Stopped smoking weed.

Since then I have completely shut down and cant function when I need to the most exam season, its all just bad timing. But Im more angry at myself because I basically asked for this, and when I didnt get the reaction I wanted I caused my own downfall.

    "My mom told me she hated me, asked me to never contact her again and called me a “low life b$;!?” I would never use such words to my children. I don’t understand how a parent couldn’t love and support who she birthed? Hurt.💔😞 Relationship with mom was never great as a child, but I always made excuses for her. She really never held the responsibility of my raising it was always amongst someone else. I dont feel like I was ever raised I think I was only ever baby sat. I dont understand why my family never gave me away to someone who would have loved me? I was always moved from place to place as a child within different family members. Just long enough for a person to get tired of me and then moved to the next house until I was forced to take care of myself at 16 years old and nobody has cared for me since. It hurts living in the world and needing advice and support but having no one to turn to because all you remember is only ever having yourself. I remember living with family members and only having two outfits and at a young age I was forced to wash my own clothing because no one would do it for me. I have no choice but to think back at these times when looking for advice and support because I never have had anyone. My mom thought she was doing a deed to keep me away from my father as a child now Ive grown up to have no one. I resent her for it.

    "I depress my partner... My partner and I have been together for 11 years now. Were very much alike and most times, thats great. Except for one. We both suffer from depression. Different reasons sprouting from different childhood crap, but the end result is the same both of us lying in bed for a few days under the covers. The problem is, I think my partner is an emotional sponge, because it almost ALWAYS works out that I get depressed first and then he will too, just two days behind. Its gotten to the point that Im getting really intense anxiety over getting depressed myself because I dont want to do that to him. It feels like something Im inflicting on him and then leaving him out to dry cuz Im still screwed up. Im there for him when hes depressed, no question. But anyone who has had depression knows youre not 100 when in the middle of it, and it seems so unfair to me that hes the strong one for me but then doesnt get the same level of help when he goes under. Its like I get someone to lean on but then he only gets someone to wallow with. He says thats all he wants, just some company and reassurance. But its hard to really hear that I was raised by narcissists and its still hard to really accept that I dont have to be on top ofam not to blame for other peoples emotional state. I just want some advice on how to better deal with the anxious thoughts surrounding this so I dont feel like its something Im putting him through, or maybe just some general ideas of how to better be there for him when Im depressed too.

I heard someone say that the goal is to be at peace not to be happy as being happy is an extreme emotion like anger. You experience happiness as a result of a stimulus. But... I dont know what peace is either. Every day I wake up and as soon as I start my day all I want to do until I get home is go back to my bed. If I have free time thats what Im doing just laying in bed. I feel like Im wasting my life away. Id like to do better for myself I really just dont know how. I dont mean to be whiney or seem like Im trying to have a pity party. I know there are people who have it way worse. I just dont know what to do to find piece. I just dont wanna feel like this anymore.",
    "My partner suffers from depression and has suicidal thoughts My partner has opened up to me about having depression and having suicidal thoughts. There were some moments when oir arguments got big that she said she feels like killing herself. She does not want to talk about it or try for counselling. I admit I do not understand the feeling someone gets when they are a their lowest point to the point of contemplating suicide. Please advice how do I provide support to her when I find it hard to understand why she would want to commit suicide.",
    "My ex husband dead because of me and I hate living I just want him.... and all this im feeling roaring in me like a fire. I cant say a word.. to no one. No one understands because what I went through. And I cant tell my kids. I have to be strong for them. They hurt too. So this is how I am truly silently feeling everyday. My world is crushed, I feel like I cant breath, cant think, much less want to. I know my kids still need me so I will stay but I really just dont wanna be here anymore.",
    "Being the boyfriend. My Girlfriend and I have been dating for almost 6 years. She has suicidal thoughts occasionally. She tells me I am very supportive and a great bf but sometimes I dont think Im giving the best support. Sorry for the long post. I dont know if theres any other SOs in this thread or if there is another sub I should be posting in I dont have anyone I can talk to about this. After about a year into dating, while we were cleaning dishes in her apartment, she let on how serious her depression was when she told me that she had once held a gun to her head. After a long silence we both cried and I told her how much I loved her. She told me that she had only ever told her best friend and didnt want anyone to know, so Ive never told anyone, not even my closest friend of 15 years whom I share anything and everything with. So thank you to whomever shares any words of wisdom youre all I got. Over the the last year our relationship has dwindled, we still tell each other we love each other constantly and talk about getting engagedmarried. But we dont have conversations like we used to, she always falls asleep on the couch so we dont sleep together hardly, we dont have sex at all, I think 6 times total last year, that has been a big point of frustration at least for me  Ive tried to initiate sex and been shot down so many times that Ive all but given up at this point, even when its your lover, your best friend, it still feels like crap when you get rejected. Ive tried to talk to her about it many times the day after or some time that is away from sex so we can have a calm conversation about it but everyone so far, every time we have talked shes gotten worked up and basically says she doesnt feel like it. We both have HPV so sometimes that gets in the way but whenever weve talked its always that shes not in the mood. I feel like shes not telling me something. I feel as if weve stopped growing and are maybe even starting to resent each other, which is scary to me."
